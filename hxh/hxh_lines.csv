8,Departure x And x Friends,1,Whale Island
9,Departure x And x Friends,1,Gon's still trying to catch the Lord of the Lake?
10,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
11,Departure x And x Friends,1,Y-Yes...
12,Departure x And x Friends,1,"He's been at it for a week, non-stop."
13,Departure x And x Friends,1,You promised he could take the Hunter Exam \Nif he caught the Lord of the Lake?
14,Departure x And x Friends,1,What a fool!
15,Departure x And x Friends,1,Five adults couldn't manage to \Nreel in that monster.
16,Departure x And x Friends,1,How is a child supposed to catch that beast?
17,Departure x And x Friends,1,Mito-san doesn't want him \Ntaking the Hunter Exam.
18,Departure x And x Friends,1,But Gon's old man was the same age \Nwhen he caught it...
19,Departure x And x Friends,1,He can't do it.
20,Departure x And x Friends,1,Got him!
21,Departure x And x Friends,1,Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
22,Departure x And x Friends,1,I got him good!
23,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's huge!
24,Departure x And x Friends,1,This is the Lord of the Lake?
25,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's been twenty years!
26,Departure x And x Friends,1,"I know! It was Gon's father that time, right?"
27,Departure x And x Friends,1,He's his father's son.
28,Departure x And x Friends,1,Gon actually caught the Lord!
29,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Look, Mito-san!"
30,Departure x And x Friends,1,Mito-san!
31,Departure x And x Friends,1,"I caught the Lord, as promised..."
32,Departure x And x Friends,1,"So I can take the Hunter Exam, right?"
33,Departure x And x Friends,1,Right?
34,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'll do my best.
35,Departure x And x Friends,1,I promise to become a Hunter!
36,Departure x And x Friends,1,It must be in the blood...
37,Departure x And x Friends,1,"No one has been able to catch the Lord after Ging pulled it off, at the age of twelve."
38,Departure x And x Friends,1,"And now his son has accomplished \Nthe same feat, at the same age."
39,Departure x And x Friends,1,His eyes have the same shine as his father's.
40,Departure x And x Friends,1,We can no longer stop him.
41,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Are you sure about this, Gon?"
42,Departure x And x Friends,1,Uh-huh.
43,Departure x And x Friends,1,Your father abandoned you \Nwhen you were still young to become a Hunter.
44,Departure x And x Friends,1,I know.
45,Departure x And x Friends,1,He chose becoming a Hunter over raising you!
46,Departure x And x Friends,1,Isn't that amazing?
47,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
48,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Being a Hunter is so great, he was willing to abandon his own kid!"
49,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's a dangerous job!
50,Departure x And x Friends,1,You never know when you might lose your life!
51,Departure x And x Friends,1,Don't you understand?
52,Departure x And x Friends,1,I don't.
53,Departure x And x Friends,1,But I want to know more!
54,Departure x And x Friends,1,I want to become a Hunter and discover why it was so important to my dad!
55,Departure x And x Friends,1,You really are Ging's son...
56,Departure x And x Friends,1,I promise I'll pass the exam.
57,Departure x And x Friends,1,"I'll pass the exam, and I'll become a Hunter!"
58,Departure x And x Friends,1,Just promise that you'll come back safe.
59,Departure x And x Friends,1,Can you do that?
60,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Uh-huh, I promise!"
61,Departure x And x Friends,1,Pinky swear made...
62,Departure x And x Friends,1,Whoever breaks their promise has \Nto swallow a thousand needles.
63,Departure x And x Friends,1,Sealed with a kiss!
64,Departure x And x Friends,1,Gon...
65,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Thank you, Mito-san."
66,Departure x And x Friends,1,Good luck!
67,Departure x And x Friends,1,Knock 'em dead!
68,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'm going to become the \Nbest Hunter in the world!
69,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Once I'm the best Hunter \Nin the world, I'll come back!"
70,Departure x And x Friends,1,The best Hunter in the world?
71,Departure x And x Friends,1,Kid doesn't respect us.
72,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Every year, there are millions of skilled \Napplicants for the Hunter Exam."
73,Departure x And x Friends,1,But only a handful are selected.
74,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Don't say stuff that you can't back up, boy."
75,Departure x And x Friends,1,"What are you doing, Katsuo?"
76,Departure x And x Friends,1,"At this rate, you'll never make a decent sailor."
77,Departure x And x Friends,1,Why are you bent over?
78,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, losers!"
79,Departure x And x Friends,1,Don't slack off!
80,Departure x And x Friends,1,"A-Aye, sir!"
81,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hey...
82,Departure x And x Friends,1,Didn't you hear me?
83,Departure x And x Friends,1,Move that box!
84,Departure x And x Friends,1,"A-Aye, Captain!"
85,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hold on.
86,Departure x And x Friends,1,Thanks!
87,Departure x And x Friends,1,A storm's coming.
88,Departure x And x Friends,1,"How can you tell, boy?"
89,Departure x And x Friends,1,That's what the seagulls are saying.
90,Departure x And x Friends,1,What?
91,Departure x And x Friends,1,Plus...
92,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's a huge storm that's coming!
93,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's true...
94,Departure x And x Friends,1,I can tell by the smell!
95,Departure x And x Friends,1,That boy...
96,Departure x And x Friends,1,Those eyes...
97,Departure x And x Friends,1,Could he be...
98,Departure x And x Friends,1,Captain!
99,Departure x And x Friends,1,The mast won't last much longer!
100,Departure x And x Friends,1,We should lower the sails!
101,Departure x And x Friends,1,Don't be stupid!
102,Departure x And x Friends,1,The fun's about to start.
103,Departure x And x Friends,1,Here we go!
104,Departure x And x Friends,1,Full to port!
105,Departure x And x Friends,1,Let's fly!
106,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hunter Vocabulary
107,Departure x And x Friends,1,Gon
108,Departure x And x Friends,1,Those waves weren't much...
109,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, take the helm."
110,Departure x And x Friends,1,A-Aye!
111,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Damn, this is one lousy crew."
112,Departure x And x Friends,1,Not a one of them can stand.
113,Departure x And x Friends,1,Pathetic.
114,Departure x And x Friends,1,And they're supposed to be \Ntaking the Hunter Examination.
115,Departure x And x Friends,1,What a laugh!
116,Departure x And x Friends,1,Here are some herbs.
117,Departure x And x Friends,1,"If you chew them, you'll feel a little better."
118,Departure x And x Friends,1,W-Water...
119,Departure x And x Friends,1,"It's coming, so hold on."
120,Departure x And x Friends,1,That boy...
121,Departure x And x Friends,1,This is one sour apple...
122,Departure x And x Friends,1,I see.
123,Departure x And x Friends,1,There are a few tough nuts on board.
124,Departure x And x Friends,1,Excuse me!
125,Departure x And x Friends,1,H-Here is your water!
126,Departure x And x Friends,1,Thanks.
127,Departure x And x Friends,1,Now drink your fill.
128,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Thanks. I really appreciate it, Katsuo-san."
129,Departure x And x Friends,1,"First, tell me your names."
130,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'm Gon!
131,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'm Kurapika.
132,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's Leorio.
133,Departure x And x Friends,1,Why do you want to become Hunters?
134,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey! If you're not an examiner, \Nyou can't boss us around!"
135,Departure x And x Friends,1,Just answer the question!
136,Departure x And x Friends,1,My dad is a Hunter.
137,Departure x And x Friends,1,I left Whale Island because I want to know why my dad desired so much to be a Hunter.
138,Departure x And x Friends,1,Whale Island...
139,Departure x And x Friends,1,So this is Ging's son.
140,Departure x And x Friends,1,The day has finally come.
141,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, kid!"
142,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
143,Departure x And x Friends,1,You're not supposed to answer his question!
144,Departure x And x Friends,1,Why can't I tell him why I'm here?
145,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Not a team player, huh?"
146,Departure x And x Friends,1,I don't wish to reveal why I'm here.
147,Departure x And x Friends,1,I agree with Leorio.
148,Departure x And x Friends,1,What?
149,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hey! Aren't you younger than I am?
150,Departure x And x Friends,1,Show some respect!
151,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's quite simple to avoid pesky questions by offering a plausible lie.
152,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hey! Are you listening to me?
153,Departure x And x Friends,1,"However, it is quite shameful to rely upon deceit."
154,Departure x And x Friends,1,"That said, if I were to tell you the truth,"
155,Departure x And x Friends,1,I would be exposing my deepest secrets.
156,Departure x And x Friends,1,That is why I cannot provide an answer.
157,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, you... Don't ignore me!"
158,Departure x And x Friends,1,"In other words, \Nyou refuse to answer my question."
159,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, Katsuo."
160,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Aye, Captain."
161,Departure x And x Friends,1,Tell the examination board that \Nwe have two more dropouts.
162,Departure x And x Friends,1,What do you mean?
163,Departure x And x Friends,1,You still haven't figured it out?
164,Departure x And x Friends,1,The Hunter Examination has already begun.
165,Departure x And x Friends,1,What?
166,Departure x And x Friends,1,There are as many Hunter wannabes as there are stars in the sky.
167,Departure x And x Friends,1,The examiners don't have the time or \Nresources to review them all.
168,Departure x And x Friends,1,"So they hire people like us, to trim the fat."
169,Departure x And x Friends,1,I've already notified the board that everyone else on this ship had to withdraw.
170,Departure x And x Friends,1,"If they couldn't handle a little storm, they'd stand no chance in the \NHunter Examination's later stages."
171,Departure x And x Friends,1,"In other words, you only proceed to \Nthe main exam if I pass you."
172,Departure x And x Friends,1,So think carefully before you answer my question.
173,Departure x And x Friends,1,So he says...
174,Departure x And x Friends,1,Should have told us sooner.
175,Departure x And x Friends,1,I am the last survivor of the Kurta Clan.
176,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Four years ago, my clan was annihilated \Nby a band of criminals."
177,Departure x And x Friends,1,"I wish to become a Hunter and \Nhunt down that band, the Phantom Troupe."
178,Departure x And x Friends,1,So you want to become a bounty hunter?
179,Departure x And x Friends,1,The Phantom Troupe is a Class-A bounty.
180,Departure x And x Friends,1,Not even the most grizzled Hunters \Ncan touch them.
181,Departure x And x Friends,1,You'd be throwing away your life.
182,Departure x And x Friends,1,I do not fear death.
183,Departure x And x Friends,1,I fear only that my rage will fade over time.
184,Departure x And x Friends,1,"So, in other words, you want revenge."
185,Departure x And x Friends,1,Does that require that you become a Hunter?
186,Departure x And x Friends,1,"That may be the stupidest question \NI've ever heard, Leorio."
187,Departure x And x Friends,1,That's Leorio-san to you!
188,Departure x And x Friends,1,Places accessible only to Hunters...
189,Departure x And x Friends,1,Information otherwise unobtainable...
190,Departure x And x Friends,1,Actions otherwise impossible...
191,Departure x And x Friends,1,There are more reasons than your \Nbrain could possibly handle.
192,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hey!
193,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Why do you want to become a Hunter, Leorio-san?"
194,Departure x And x Friends,1,Me?
195,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'll make it short.
196,Departure x And x Friends,1,I want money.
197,Departure x And x Friends,1,Money can get you everything!
198,Departure x And x Friends,1,A big house!
199,Departure x And x Friends,1,A nice car!
200,Departure x And x Friends,1,Good liquor!
201,Departure x And x Friends,1,"You can't buy class with money, Leorio."
202,Departure x And x Friends,1,That's three times now.
203,Departure x And x Friends,1,Step outside.
204,Departure x And x Friends,1,"I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, here and now."
205,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Take that back, Leorio!"
206,Departure x And x Friends,1,Take that back!
207,Departure x And x Friends,1,That's Leorio-san to you.
208,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Hey, boys!"
209,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'm not finished yet!
210,Departure x And x Friends,1,Just let them go.
211,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
212,Departure x And x Friends,1,Mito-san once told me...
213,Departure x And x Friends,1,"If you want to get to know someone, you need to make an effort to learn why they're angry."
214,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's important for them to \Nunderstand why they're mad.
215,Departure x And x Friends,1,So we should let them settle it themselves.
216,Departure x And x Friends,1,Captain!
217,Departure x And x Friends,1,L-Look...
218,Departure x And x Friends,1,"If we get caught by that waterspout, \Nthe ship will sink."
219,Departure x And x Friends,1,Lower the sails now.
220,Departure x And x Friends,1,Aye!
221,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'll help!
222,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Uh-huh, come with me."
223,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'll take the helm.
224,Departure x And x Friends,1,Aye!
225,Departure x And x Friends,1,Full to starboard!
226,Departure x And x Friends,1,Hurry!
227,Departure x And x Friends,1,The waterspout is gonna catch us!
228,Departure x And x Friends,1,Take back what you said!
229,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Take back your words, \Nand I'll forgive you, Leorio."
230,Departure x And x Friends,1,How many times must I repeat myself?
231,Departure x And x Friends,1,You should show me some respect.
232,Departure x And x Friends,1,I won't back down.
233,Departure x And x Friends,1,Then I have no choice...
234,Departure x And x Friends,1,Katsuo-san!
235,Departure x And x Friends,1,Damn it!
236,Departure x And x Friends,1,Pull 'em out! Now...
237,Departure x And x Friends,1,You idiot!
238,Departure x And x Friends,1,"If we hadn't grabbed your legs, you'd be shark bait now."
239,Departure x And x Friends,1,Honestly...
240,Departure x And x Friends,1,How reckless can you be?
241,Departure x And x Friends,1,But you did catch me.
242,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
243,Departure x And x Friends,1,You both caught me!
244,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Well, I guess so..."
245,Departure x And x Friends,1,Gon!
246,Departure x And x Friends,1,Katsuo-san!
247,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Thanks, Gon!"
248,Departure x And x Friends,1,You saved my life.
249,Departure x And x Friends,1,I couldn't have done it alone.
250,Departure x And x Friends,1,These two helped save you.
251,Departure x And x Friends,1,Huh?
252,Departure x And x Friends,1,Thank you very much!
253,Departure x And x Friends,1,"No, you don't need to thank me."
254,Departure x And x Friends,1,Well...
255,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Yeah, I'm glad you're okay."
256,Departure x And x Friends,1,Yeah! So I'll be returning to my station!
257,Departure x And x Friends,1,What?
258,Departure x And x Friends,1,I apologize for my rude behavior.
259,Departure x And x Friends,1,"Sorry, Leorio-san."
260,Departure x And x Friends,1,Wh-What's with the sudden change?
261,Departure x And x Friends,1,We sound like strangers...
262,Departure x And x Friends,1,Just call me Leorio... Leorio works.
263,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'm also sorry.
264,Departure x And x Friends,1,I take back everything I said.
265,Departure x And x Friends,1,I was wrong.
266,Departure x And x Friends,1,"No, it's okay."
267,Departure x And x Friends,1,I like you guys!
268,Departure x And x Friends,1,Okay!
269,Departure x And x Friends,1,I'll take responsibility for bringing you three to the port closest to the exam site.
270,Departure x And x Friends,1,Really?
271,Departure x And x Friends,1,What about your test?
272,Departure x And x Friends,1,Like I said...
273,Departure x And x Friends,1,It's my decision to make.
274,Departure x And x Friends,1,And all three of you pass!
275,Departure x And x Friends,1,Yay!
276,Departure x And x Friends,1,And so began Gon's journey...
277,Departure x And x Friends,1,To follow in his father's footsteps \Nand become a Hunter.
278,Departure x And x Friends,1,Next time: Test x Of x Tests.
279,Departure x And x Friends,1,Look forward to it!
280,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
281,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
282,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
283,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
284,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
285,Test x Of x Tests.,2,They are known...
286,Test x Of x Tests.,2,...as Hunters!
287,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Okay!
288,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'll take responsibility for bringing you three to the port closest to the exam site.
289,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Yay!
290,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Test x Of x Tests
291,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Dolle Harbor
292,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"After winning the captain's favor, the trio of Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio arrived safely at Dolle Harbor."
293,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Thanks, Captain!"
294,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I had a great time!
295,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"I had fun, too."
296,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Right! As a token of my appreciation,"
297,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'll give you some advice.
298,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Advice?
299,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?
300,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Uh-huh.
301,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You should make your way there first.
302,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's a shortcut to the exam site.
303,Test x Of x Tests.,2,A shortcut?
304,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Got it!
305,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"So, I just need to head for that tree!"
306,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"I'll do that, Captain!"
307,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Thanks!
308,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Best of luck!
309,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Yep! Same to you!
310,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Take care!
311,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Rest easy, Ging."
312,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your son has grown into a respectable young man.
313,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh... That's strange.
314,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Why?
315,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"According to the notice I received, the exam is supposedly being held \Nsomewhere in Zaban City."
316,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Right now, we're here."
317,Test x Of x Tests.,2,That tree is in the opposite direction.
318,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Perhaps you misheard him?
319,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree."
320,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see...
321,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And this notice isn't any help!
322,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Where, exactly, in Zaban City \Nare we meant to go?"
323,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Our task is to find the exam site, \Nusing a limited amount of information."
324,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Just another test before we'll be allowed \Nto take the Hunter Exam.
325,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I-I knew that...
326,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I already knew that!
327,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Anyway, I'll go have a look."
328,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The captain must have had \Na reason to suggest that.
329,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Hey, hey..."
330,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You're serious?
331,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The bus to Zaban is about to leave.
332,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We should just take it.
333,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hey!
334,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Man...
335,Test x Of x Tests.,2,He's gotta learn that you \Ncan't trust everyone.
336,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh?
337,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hey!
338,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika!
339,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Gon's behavior interests me more \Nthan the captain's advice.
340,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm going with him.
341,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Oh, is that so?"
342,Test x Of x Tests.,2,See ya.
343,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.
344,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...
345,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm just gonna take the bus!
346,Test x Of x Tests.,2,So it was a trap...
347,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Seems none of the buses have \Nmade it to Zaban City.
348,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Rookies usually fail this part \Nbecause they're too naïve.
349,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Wait, wait, wait!"
350,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wait for me!
351,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Well, I knew you guys would \Nbe lonely without me."
352,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And it's no fun traveling alone.
353,Test x Of x Tests.,2,So I decided to stick with you \Nguys a while longer.
354,Test x Of x Tests.,2,This is a creepy place...
355,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I don't see a single person.
356,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"No, there are plenty here."
357,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What?
358,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wh-What's with the freak show?
359,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Exciting...
360,Test x Of x Tests.,2,E-Exciting?
361,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Exciting...
362,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Exciting.
363,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Exciting two-choice quiz!
364,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"You boys are headed for that \Ntree on the hill, correct?"
365,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"To reach that tree, you must pass through this town."
366,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh?
367,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I shall administer a single-question quiz.
368,Test x Of x Tests.,2,H-Hold on!
369,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What's going on here?
370,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You'll have five seconds to state your answer.
371,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified."
372,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You'll have to give up on taking \Nthis year's Hunter Exam.
373,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see...
374,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.
375,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see how it is.
376,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I happen to be a quiz expert.
377,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wait. Only one question?
378,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.
379,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Any other answer will be considered incorrect.
380,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hold on!
381,Test x Of x Tests.,2,All three of us share one question?
382,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"So if one of them answers incorrectly, \NI'm disqualified, too?"
383,Test x Of x Tests.,2,As if that would happen!
384,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What scares me is the high likelihood \Nof the vice versa happening.
385,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What was that?
386,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But you know...
387,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"This way's easier, since only one of us \Nneeds to know the answer."
388,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm not good at quizzes.
389,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I suppose...
390,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Fair point.
391,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Hey, there. Hurry it up."
392,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Or else I'll answer the question first.
393,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Who are you?
394,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"He followed us here, all the way from port."
395,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh? Seriously?
396,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Sorry, kid."
397,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I happened to overhear your conversation.
398,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What will you do?
399,Test x Of x Tests.,2,He seems eager to take it.
400,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We should let him go first.
401,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"That way, we'll know what kind \Nof question to expect."
402,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I don't mind.
403,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I have no objection.
404,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Then I'll get to it.
405,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Fools.
406,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.
407,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Here is your question...
408,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.
409,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You can only save one.
410,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover."
411,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Which will you save?
412,Test x Of x Tests.,2,H-How is this even a quiz?
413,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The answer is 1.
414,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Oh? Why do you say that?
415,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Because you can't replace your mother.
416,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But you can find another lover.
417,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What?
418,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You may pass.
419,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What?
420,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You just have to tell the old lady \Nwhat she wants to hear.
421,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Adios.
422,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Hey, now! That's all bull!"
423,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How was that the right answer?
424,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We're supposed to give the answer \Nthe old lady wants?
425,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And that's considered correct?
426,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Hey, say something!"
427,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I won't put up with this sham.
428,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'll find a different route.
429,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's too late.
430,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified."
431,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Th-That's just ridiculous!
432,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Different people would expect different answers!
433,Test x Of x Tests.,2,There is no right answer!
434,Test x Of x Tests.,2,No right answer...
435,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see!
436,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Leorio!
437,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wait!
438,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.
439,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Not another word from you.
440,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Say anything but the answer, and you're immediately disqualified."
441,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Wake up, Leorio..."
442,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's a simple trick...
443,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Gon...
444,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Here is your question...
445,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.
446,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You can only rescue one.
447,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter."
448,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Which will you rescue?
449,Test x Of x Tests.,2,She's making fun of us...
450,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Five.
451,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Go ahead and count down, you hag."
452,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Four.
453,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Three.
454,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Two.
455,Test x Of x Tests.,2,One.
456,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Buzz. Time's up.
457,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Don't stop me, Kurapika!"
458,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I won't be satisfied until I've \Ntaught this hag a lesson!
459,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Calm down, Leorio!"
460,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How am I supposed to calm down?
461,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You'll waste our correct response.
462,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Correct response?
463,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We gave the right answer.
464,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Silence was the correct response.
465,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Silence? What do you mean...
466,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You hit the nail on the head.
467,Test x Of x Tests.,2,There is no right answer!
468,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Precisely.
469,Test x Of x Tests.,2,This quiz had no right answer.
470,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"However, we could only state \N1 or 2 as the answer."
471,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"In other words, we weren't meant \Nto respond at all."
472,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Silence was the only response.
473,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But what about that other guy?
474,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"They never said he gave the right answer. \NShe only said, ""You may pass."""
475,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"In other words, this path is the wrong path."
476,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Am I right?
477,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Precisely.
478,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The correct path is over here.
479,Test x Of x Tests.,2,This leads directly to the tree.
480,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top."
481,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Oh, so that's what this was about..."
482,Test x Of x Tests.,2,A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.
483,Test x Of x Tests.,2,They serve as Navigators.
484,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"If you meet their standards, I believe that \Nthey will guide you to the exam site."
485,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness."
486,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Don't be. I don't mind.
487,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I do this job because I enjoy \Nmeeting people like you.
488,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh?
489,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Do your best to become a good Hunter.
490,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's no use. I can't think of an answer.
491,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You were still trying to find an answer?
492,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You can stop.
493,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh? Why?
494,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The quiz is over.
495,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I know.
496,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But...
497,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But you know...
498,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What if I run into a situation like that and I can only save one person...
499,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What should I do then?
500,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It wouldn't be right to choose just one...
501,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"But one day, I might have \Nto make that choice."
502,Test x Of x Tests.,2,That's right.
503,Test x Of x Tests.,2,That is the true purpose of this test.
504,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You must be prepared to face the \Nworst possible scenarios...
505,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Because harsh reality strikes without warning.
506,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You must be prepared for \Nthe day your paths diverge.
507,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hunter Vocabulary
508,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika
509,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's totally dark out...
510,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"""Walk two hours,"" she said?"
511,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"It was two hours, two hours ago!"
512,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Damn.
513,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Beware of Magical Beasts!
514,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Another ""Beware of Magical Beasts"" sign?"
515,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?
516,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm hungry!
517,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I need to take a dump!
518,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Leorio!
519,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We'll leave you behind!
520,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"I've gotta take a leak, too!"
521,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see it.
522,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hey!
523,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hello? Anyone home?
524,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Are they out?
525,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We're coming in.
526,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's a Magical Beast!
527,Test x Of x Tests.,2,A Magical Beast?
528,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!"
529,Test x Of x Tests.,2,They can take human form!
530,Test x Of x Tests.,2,That's an extremely intelligent creature!
531,Test x Of x Tests.,2,There's a woman in his arms!
532,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And the guy on the floor \Nneeds medical attention...
533,Test x Of x Tests.,2,P-Please...
534,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Please save my wife...
535,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!"
536,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Got it!
537,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"He can follow that faint shadow, \Neven through this dark forest."
538,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Impressive.
539,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kiriko! Let her go!
540,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Take her from me, if you can!"
541,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wow! He can talk!
542,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"That Magical Beast, \Nthe Kiriko, uses human speech."
543,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Oh. That makes this a lot easier!
544,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hey! Silly Kiriko!
545,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What?
546,Test x Of x Tests.,2,H-He's fast!
547,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika!
548,Test x Of x Tests.,2,He's so reckless...
549,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Stupid kid.
550,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You'll pay for this!
551,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wait!
552,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Are you okay?
553,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Are you injured anywhere?
554,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm okay.
555,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What about my husband?
556,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How is he?
557,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Don't worry.
558,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Our friend is taking care of him.
559,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Please take me to my husband!
560,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Those tattoos...
561,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You're...
562,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika!
563,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You okay?
564,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Leorio?
565,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Whew... Guess you guys are all right.
566,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How is that man?
567,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Yeah, no worries."
568,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.
569,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"I gave him some painkillers, \Nand he's sound asleep in the cabin."
570,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I see...
571,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How did you know?
572,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How did you know I was an impostor?
573,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I didn't think that you were.
574,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"I told Leorio to take care of the \Ninjured man, and he consented."
575,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,"
576,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I attacked you for foolishly leaving \Nan injured man on his own.
577,Test x Of x Tests.,2,That's all.
578,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Now I need you to answer my question.
579,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Who are you?
580,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Wait!
581,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"For a kid, you're pretty quick."
582,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.
583,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You're about to discover the high price that accomplishment came with!
584,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Who are you?
585,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You aren't the one I hit.
586,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Are you his friend?
587,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How can you tell that I'm not the same one?
588,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Huh?
589,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your face is completely different.
590,Test x Of x Tests.,2,And your voice is a little higher and thinner.
591,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What?
592,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Did I say something funny?
593,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Hey, sweetheart!"
594,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Come out here!
595,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You're gonna love this!
596,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hmm...
597,Test x Of x Tests.,2,How many years has it been since someone \Nwas able to tell us apart?
598,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm ecstatic!
599,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Can you tell their faces and \Nvoices are different?
600,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"No, not at all..."
601,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"You see, the one Kurapika and I \Nbeat up is the husband."
602,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Which one are you talking about?
603,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Allow us to introduce ourselves.
604,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We are the Navigators.
605,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Our family provides support \Nfor the Hunter Exam.
606,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm their daughter!
607,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm their son!
608,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Man, you had us fooled."
609,Test x Of x Tests.,2,The Hunter Exam changes site every year.
610,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's quite difficult to locate it.
611,Test x Of x Tests.,2,So we Navigators help by guiding \Nthe applicants to the site.
612,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Oh, that's how it works."
613,Test x Of x Tests.,2,But we don't help every candidate.
614,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We test applicants to see if they're qualified to take the exam.
615,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika-dono.
616,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Yes.
617,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You successfully used the most vague of hints to determine that we weren't spouses.
618,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"The hint was these tattoos \Nwhich, in this region, mark a woman as single for life."
619,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Kurapika-dono demonstrated that \Nhe is very knowledgeable.
620,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Therefore, he passes."
621,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Way to go, Kurapika."
622,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Thanks.
623,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Leorio-dono.
624,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Yeah...
625,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You never realized my true identity.
626,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"However, you dressed my injuries faster and more thoroughly than any doctor."
627,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Most importantly, you continued \Nto reassure me that my wife was safe."
628,Test x Of x Tests.,2,S-Stop it...
629,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's embarrassing...
630,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your kindness makes you worthy \Nto take the Hunter Exam.
631,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Thus, you pass."
632,Test x Of x Tests.,2,R-Really?
633,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Thank goodness...
634,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You did it!
635,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"And finally, Gon-dono."
636,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Yes!
637,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Your superhuman physical ability \Nand powers of observation make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.
638,Test x Of x Tests.,2,You pass.
639,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We will now take you to the exam site.
640,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Isn't it great that we all passed?
641,Test x Of x Tests.,2,It's too early to celebrate.
642,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We've merely earned the right \Nto take the real exam.
643,Test x Of x Tests.,2,What's wrong with celebrating a little?
644,Test x Of x Tests.,2,We're making progress.
645,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"Honestly, you people really should think."
646,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?
647,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Stop moving around!
648,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"If you fall, blame yourself!"
649,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Gon and his friends enjoy a brief \Njourney through the sky.
650,Test x Of x Tests.,2,"However, they still haven't reached \Nthe starting line."
651,Test x Of x Tests.,2,Next time: Rivals x For x Survival.
652,Test x Of x Tests.,2,I'm going to do my best!
653,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
654,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
655,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
656,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
657,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
658,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,They are known...
659,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,...as Hunters!
660,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,We will now take you to the exam site.
661,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Isn't it great that we all passed?
662,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's too early to celebrate.
663,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,We've merely earned the right \Nto take the real exam.
664,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What's wrong with celebrating a little?
665,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,We're making progress.
666,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Rivals x For x Survival
667,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Zaban City
668,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Gon and his new friends have arrived in Zaban City, site of the Hunter Exam, aided by the Kiriko Navigators."
669,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"As Navigators, our job is to identify \Nworthy Hunter applicants and guide them to the exam site."
670,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"In other words, it would be extremely \Ndifficult for someone to reach the site without a Navigator's help."
671,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hey, wanna try one?"
672,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's Zaban's famous panda-frog-on-a-stick!
673,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,A true delicacy!
674,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This brooch was excavated from \NZaban's underground palace.
675,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I bet that it's a national treasure.
676,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"You know, Zaban City is quite a shady place."
677,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Prosperous cities tend to attract \Nall sorts of nasty types.
678,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"What are you doing, Gon?"
679,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,We're going!
680,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Yeah!
681,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I believe that is the building.
682,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Huh?
683,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's so tall!
684,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,They have a really nice building.
685,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,So this is the exam site...
686,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This is what draws...
687,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hunter applicants from across the world.
688,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,My first shot at the Hunter Exam...
689,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Was this how Dad felt, when he first arrived?"
690,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hey, guys!"
691,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hmm?
692,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Over here.
693,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What?
694,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Here.
695,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Wait, this isn't funny."
696,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Isn't that an ordinary restaurant?
697,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You can't possibly mean that Hunter \Napplicants from around the world are meant to assemble here?
698,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I do.
699,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Huh?
700,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"No one would ever expect the Hunter Exam, with its millions of candidates, \Nto be located here, right?"
701,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That's true.
702,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Welcome!
703,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Is the back room open?
704,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What will you have?
705,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The steak combo that opens \Nyour eyes to the light.
706,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,For three.
707,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,For three...
708,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,How would you like them?
709,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Grilled over a low flame, until cooked."
710,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Got it. Let yourself into the back room.
711,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Wait here.
712,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Wait?
713,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Where are the others?
714,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I can't wait for the steak combo.
715,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Gon, that was just the password \Nto get us inside."
716,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, we don't get to eat?"
717,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,One in every ten thousand...
718,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hmm?
719,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The number of applicants \Nwho make it this far.
720,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You've done extremely well for first-timers.
721,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, good luck."
722,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Thanks!
723,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"I would be happy to serve as your \NNavigator next year, as well."
724,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What?
725,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It appears this room is an elevator.
726,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Bastard...
727,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That meant that he expects us \Nto fail this year.
728,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Once every three years.
729,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What's that?
730,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The frequency with which a \Nrookie passes the exam.
731,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Huh?
732,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's that unusual?
733,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Some cannot endure the exam's physical and mental strain.
734,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"It's also not unusual for veterans to break the rookies, \Nwho consequently never retake the test."
735,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,So I guess candidates are willing to risk \Neverything to become Hunters.
736,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"But of course, my friend!"
737,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hunters make the most money in this world!
738,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,No!
739,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hunters are the most noble in this world.
740,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Glory hog...
741,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Money grubber!
742,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Gon! Listen...
743,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Every year, over fifty Hunters make the list of the world's \Nhundred richest people!"
744,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hunters are associated with \Nhunting wild game and treasure, but they are all second-rate."
745,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,True Hunters work to protect \Npeople and the natural order.
746,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Now, look here..."
747,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Once you're a Hunter, most countries \Nwill give you a free pass!"
748,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,And no charge to use public facilities.
749,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,How are those benefits?
750,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hunters have many difficult and \Nimportant responsibilities, such as preserving cultural artifacts \Nand endangered species, as well as capturing wanted criminals \Nand unscrupulous Hunters."
751,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The fame and money...
752,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That's why people wish to become Hunters!
753,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Profound knowledge, a healthy mind and body, and unyielding conviction..."
754,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Those are the qualities on which \NHunters pride themselves!
755,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Gon! What do you think?
756,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Which kind of Hunter do you \Nhope to become?!
757,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, when you put it that way..."
758,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I think we've arrived.
759,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,We'll continue this later.
760,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Strange atmosphere down here.
761,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,They clearly differ from the \NHunter applicants we saw at the port and in the city.
762,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Each is a master, in their own right..."
763,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Excuse me...
764,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Everyone's really tense.
765,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hello. Please take a number.
766,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Here you go.
767,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Here.
768,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Be sure you wear this on \Nyour chest at all times.
769,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Be careful not to lose it.
770,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Haven't seen you guys around before.
771,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Yo.
772,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You can tell we're new?
773,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,More or less.
774,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"After all, this will be my thirty-fifth attempt."
775,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Thirty-five times?!
776,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, you could say I'm an exam veteran."
777,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That isn't something to brag about.
778,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Indeed.
779,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"If you have any questions, \Nfeel free to ask me."
780,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Thank you.
781,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,My name is Tonpa.
782,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'm Gon.
783,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,These are Kurapika and Leorio.
784,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hey, are there others who have taken the exam a bunch \Nof times like you?"
785,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, I have the most experience here, but there are a few others."
786,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"For instance, there's him..."
787,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Number 255,"
788,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Todo, the wrestler."
789,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He's unmatched in strength.
790,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,And he's smarter than he looks.
791,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"On the other side, we have number 103,"
792,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Bourbon, the snake charmer."
793,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"He tends to hold grudges, so you don't want to end up on his bad side."
794,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,And then...
795,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Number 191, Bodoro, \Nthe kung fu master."
796,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"He's getting old, but there still isn't \Na better martial artist around."
797,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Then you have the three brothers, \NAmori, Imori, and Umori."
798,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"They perform consistently well, thanks to their excellent teamwork."
799,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"And number 384, Gerreta, \Nthe huntsman."
800,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"He specializes in killing all manner of creatures, \Nby blow dart and club."
801,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"There are many more, but they have taken the test \Nthe most times."
802,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Ah...
803,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, how peculiar..."
804,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,His arms seem to have become flower petals.
805,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,No smoke and mirrors here.
806,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Do take care.
807,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"When you bump into someone, \Nyou really should apologize."
808,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That psychopath is back again.
809,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Again?
810,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Does that mean he took last year's exam?
811,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Number 44. Hisoka, the magician."
812,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Last year, he was a virtual \Nlock to pass the test, until he all but killed an examiner he didn't like."
813,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,A-And they're still allowing him to \Nretake the exam this year?
814,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Of course.
815,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Every year, the examiners and \Ntest content change, and the examiners are the ones \Nwho choose the new content."
816,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The devil himself could pass if that were \Nthe examiners' determination.
817,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That's just how the Hunter Exam works.
818,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Anyway, no one likes him."
819,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"You should stay away, too."
820,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He looks dangerous. \NThat much is for sure.
821,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, right..."
822,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,A little something to mark our acquaintance.
823,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,How about it?
824,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, appreciated."
825,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"As it happened, I was thirsty..."
826,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Thanks!
827,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Thank you.
828,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,There he goes.
829,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"He always plays the nice guy, despite being nastier than \Nanyone else here."
830,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Tonpa, the rookie crusher..."
831,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Best of luck to all of us!
832,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The juice I gave you contains an \Nextremely strong laxative.
833,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"One sip, and for three days, your guts will be a non-stop roller coaster."
834,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You'll need diapers to take the exam.
835,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Hunter Vocabulary
836,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Leorio
837,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Tonpa-san, this juice must have expired."
838,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It tastes funny.
839,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Seriously?
840,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That was close!
841,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,H-Huh? That's strange...
842,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Impossible!
843,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That laxative should have \Npractically no taste nor scent.
844,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'm very sorry!
845,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I didn't realize the juice had gone bad.
846,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's okay. You don't have to apologize.
847,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Is your stomach okay?
848,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Y-Yes... I'm fine.
849,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I've sampled all kinds of mountain \Ngrasses and plants.
850,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,So I can usually taste when something's bad.
851,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,R-Really?
852,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That's amazing...
853,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Damn... I had to run into \Nthis wild mountain kid.
854,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Sorry about that again.
855,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'll see you around.
856,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Talkative old man...
857,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Still, there's something wrong \Nwith this year's rookies."
858,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"That number 294, Hanzo, too."
859,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He seemed gullible when I approached him.
860,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Don't tell anyone else, but I'm actually a ninja."
861,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Huh?
862,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, really?"
863,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I seek the legendary scroll... Shh...
864,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The Ultimate Ninja Scroll. \NThat is why I desire to become a Hunter.
865,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I've heard that it's hidden somewhere inaccessible to ordinary people.
866,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Anyway, it's boring here..."
867,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Yeah, I guess... So, how about it?"
868,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Let's toast our new friendship.
869,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"As a ninja, I make it a point to never drink anything someone else offers."
870,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Sorry.
871,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I-I see...
872,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I could tell by his eyes that he's no fool.
873,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"One false step, and I could've \Nbeen in real danger."
874,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Speaking of danger, there's number 301..."
875,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That guy just oozes peril. \NI can't even go near him.
876,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Then there's that guy I can't stand, number 187, Nicolas."
877,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Must've been tough to make it here.
878,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Not really. Everything went \Nas predicted by my data...
879,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"I used historical data, from past Hunter Exams, \Nto calculate this year's location."
880,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Quite simple.
881,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Frankly, I was bored senseless."
882,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,R-Really... That's amazing.
883,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,My name is Tonpa. Nice to meet you.
884,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Tonpa-san, is it?"
885,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, there you are."
886,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"This is your thirty-fifth attempt, the second-highest number by one person."
887,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"And with thirty, you have the most \Nconsecutive appearances."
888,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Very impressive.
889,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Please, it's no big deal."
890,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,How about it? \NLet's drink to our new friendship...
891,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,But you have yet to actually pass the exam.
892,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I assume that's because you're too absorbed by your other objective.
893,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Eh?
894,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Tonpa-san, the rookie crusher."
895,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What?
896,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, I won't share my knowledge \Nwith anyone else, seeing as you hold the consecutive \Nappearance record..."
897,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Goodbye.
898,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Bastard... Just you wait.
899,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'll break that snotty nose of yours.
900,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Hey, Tonpa-san!"
901,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Could I have more of that juice?
902,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Must be my nerves.
903,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'm really thirsty.
904,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Eh?
905,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Oh, sure..."
906,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What the hell?
907,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The laxative he drank earlier should \Nhave taken effect by now.
908,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What's going on?
909,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"It's only a laxative, but if he imbibes that much, \Nhe could die of dehydration."
910,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Worried?
911,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'll be fine. I've trained.
912,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Poisons won't affect me.
913,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Poisons?
914,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He knew what was in the juice?
915,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,But he still drank it?
916,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Number 99, Killua."
917,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This year's rookies are all insane...
918,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Well, it doesn't matter."
919,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,That just means crushing them will \Nbe all the more worthwhile.
920,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I apologize for the wait.
921,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The entry period for \NHunter applicants has ended.
922,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The Hunter Exam will now begin!
923,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,A final caution.
924,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"If you are short on luck or ability, you could very well end up seriously injured or even dead."
925,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Those who accept the risks, \Nplease follow me."
926,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Otherwise, please exit via \Nthe elevator behind you."
927,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Very well.
928,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,All 404 applicants will participate in Phase One.
929,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"Of course, no one turned around and left."
930,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'd hoped a few might withdraw.
931,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Wh-What?
932,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The people in front started running.
933,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He's picked up the pace.
934,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I neglected to introduce myself.
935,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner."
936,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I shall lead you to the exam's Second Phase.
937,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Second Phase?
938,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,What about Phase One?
939,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It has already commenced.
940,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,It's already begun?
941,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This is part of the test?
942,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You must follow me to Phase Two.
943,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This is the exam's First Phase.
944,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Follow you? That's it?
945,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Yes.
946,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I cannot tell you where or \Nwhen you must arrive.
947,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,You need to follow me.
948,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I see how it is.
949,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,This test is weird.
950,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I expect it's an endurance test.
951,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Fine by me.
952,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,I'll be right behind you!
953,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,But there is the mental stress \Nof not knowing how far we'll have to run.
954,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,He's also testing our mental fortitude.
955,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,"The exam's First Phase begins, amidst a mix of warriors and knaves."
956,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,One candidate is disqualified \Nbefore it even starts.
957,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,The total number of Hunter \Napplicants is 404.
958,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Next time: Hope x And x Ambition.
959,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Time to go fishin'!
960,Rivals x For x Survival.,3,Yeah!
961,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
962,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
963,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
964,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
965,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
966,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,They are known...
967,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,...as Hunters!
968,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The Hunter Exam will now begin!
969,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I am Satotz, the Phase One examiner."
970,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You must follow me to Phase Two.
971,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,This is the exam's First Phase.
972,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hope x And x Ambition
973,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Two hours have passed since \Nthe start of the exam.
974,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The applicants have traveled over thirty kilometers from the start.
975,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,None of them knows how far they must go.
976,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"They are forced to run at the leader's pace, \Nwith no goal specified."
977,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It's a monotonous course with no end in sight.
978,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,And many applicants have \Nalready dropped out.
979,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Extrapolating from historical data, \Nthis exam type usually involves a forty-kilometer course."
980,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,My calculations suggest that we are nearing the goal...
981,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I underestimated the Hunter Exam.
982,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Every person here is a monster.
983,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It's a gathering of monsters...
984,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey! Wait up, kid!"
985,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hmm?
986,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You should show the \NHunter Exam some respect!
987,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What do you mean?
988,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Why are you using a skateboard?
989,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's cheating!
990,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Why?
991,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Why...
992,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,This is an endurance test!
993,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"No, it isn't."
994,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
995,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Gon, what are you saying?"
996,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The examiner only told us to follow him.
997,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Whose side are you on, eh?"
998,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, how old are you?"
999,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm twelve years old.
1000,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hmm...
1001,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We're the same age.
1002,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1003,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Guess I'll run too.
1004,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Wow!
1005,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That was cool!
1006,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm Killua.
1007,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm Gon.
1008,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Damn it...
1009,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Making a fool out of me...
1010,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Impossible.
1011,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It's impossible!
1012,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,My calculations are never wrong!
1013,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,So why...
1014,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Am I... going to fail?
1015,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,For me to fail...
1016,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's absurd.
1017,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Unthinkable!
1018,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I won't accept that!
1019,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, rookie!"
1020,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You're a mess.
1021,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It's rare to see someone \Nout of steam so early.
1022,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You must be a hell of an incompetent.
1023,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,People like you are doomed \Nto fail the Hunter Exam.
1024,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"So don't come back, snotrag!"
1025,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Here. Thanks.
1026,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Great work.
1027,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He won't recover from the abuse \Nwe just dished out.
1028,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I doubt he'll ever take the \NHunter Exam again.
1029,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Anyway, Tonpa..."
1030,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You really do love crushing rookies.
1031,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I live for it.
1032,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It's been about four hours since the exam began.
1033,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We must have traveled at least sixty kilometers.
1034,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,How much farther do we need to go?
1035,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Only one rookie, every three years, \Npasses the Hunter Exam."
1036,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"So for a normal human like me, it isn't even worth dreaming about..."
1037,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Damn it.
1038,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, forget him."
1039,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Let's get going.
1040,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Screw that...
1041,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm gonna become a Hunter!
1042,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Damn it all!
1043,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Cool!
1044,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Let me try that later.
1045,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"If you let me try your skateboard, okay?"
1046,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We've reached the eighty-kilometer mark.
1047,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It is now time to pick up the pace a bit.
1048,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Wait, are you serious?"
1049,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That guy's insane.
1050,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"He's prancing up the stairs, \Nas if they're not even there."
1051,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"If he keeps up this pace, tons of people will fail."
1052,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Gon, wanna race to see who finishes first?"
1053,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Sure.
1054,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The loser has to buy dinner.
1055,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Okay, you're on!"
1056,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Ready...
1057,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Go!
1058,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Leorio, are you okay?"
1059,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Sure!
1060,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Just look at me.
1061,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I realized that I can keep going if I don't worry about how stupid I look!
1062,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I should probably follow his example.
1063,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Leorio...
1064,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I have a question.
1065,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What?
1066,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Is this too easy for you, Kurapika?"
1067,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Talking just wastes energy!
1068,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Are you really trying to become \Na Hunter for the money?
1069,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"You aren't, right?"
1070,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"We've only been together for a few days, but I know you better than that."
1071,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Sure, you have a nasty attitude, \Nand you aren't very bright."
1072,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,But you're not a shallow person.
1073,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I've seen many who live for money.
1074,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You're nothing like them.
1075,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You and your logic...
1076,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Scarlet eyes.
1077,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's why the Kurta were targeted.
1078,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We Kurta are known for \Nour unique scarlet eyes.
1079,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"When our emotions are heightened, our eyes turn scarlet, as though on fire."
1080,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The eyes in that scarlet state are considered one of the seven most \Nbeautiful colors in the world.
1081,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,They command high prices \Non the black market.
1082,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's why the Phantom Troupe \Nattacked you?
1083,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,They took every single eye from \Nmy brethren's corpses.
1084,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I can still hear their darkened eyes \Ncrying out in anguish...
1085,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I swear I will capture the Phantom Troupe!
1086,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,And I will reclaim the eyes of my clan!
1087,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's why you want to be a Hunter?
1088,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Yeah, if I become a Hunter with rich clients,"
1089,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'll gain access to black market information.
1090,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,But you'll have to swallow your pride and become the kind of Hunter you despise!
1091,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"The blow to my pride is nothing, measured against the suffering \Nmy clan endured."
1092,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Sorry, but I have no noble cause."
1093,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1094,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm just after money.
1095,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Don't lie!
1096,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm not lying!
1097,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You really believe you can buy \Neverything with money?
1098,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You bet!
1099,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"For the right price, you can buy not only \Ntreasures, but dreams, hearts, and even people's lives!"
1100,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Take that back, Leorio!"
1101,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"If you're insulting the Kurta, \NI won't forgive you."
1102,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Why? I'm telling the truth.
1103,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"If I'd had money, my friend \Nwouldn't have died!"
1104,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,An illness?
1105,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,It was a treatable disease...
1106,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The problem was that the \Noperation costs a fortune.
1107,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I was naïve!
1108,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I thought I could become a doctor...
1109,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I wanted to cure kids who have \Nthe same disease, and be able to tell them \Nit was free of charge!"
1110,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Then I could have told his parents, too."
1111,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That was my dream...
1112,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What a joke.
1113,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Turns out that to become a doctor, you need even more money!"
1114,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Got it?
1115,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The world runs on money...
1116,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,So I want money!
1117,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"See you at the goal, Kurapika."
1118,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Catch you later, old timer."
1119,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm not old!
1120,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I'm a teenager, just like you guys!"
1121,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1122,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,No way!
1123,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hunter Vocabulary
1124,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Killua
1125,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Can't take another step...
1126,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Th-This is it...
1127,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm impressed that you \Ncan keep up with me.
1128,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Really?
1129,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Or maybe it's just that \Neveryone else is too slow.
1130,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Man...
1131,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The Hunter Exam is gonna be a breeze.
1132,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's no fun.
1133,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, why do you want to \Nbecome a Hunter?"
1134,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Me?
1135,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm not really interested in \Nbecoming a Hunter.
1136,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1137,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I heard the exam was supposed \Nto be really hard, so I thought it'd be fun."
1138,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,But this is disappointing.
1139,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What about you?
1140,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Well, my dad's a Hunter."
1141,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"So I want to become a Hunter, like my dad."
1142,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hmm...
1143,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What kind of Hunter is he?
1144,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I don't know.
1145,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's kinda weird.
1146,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Really?
1147,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"You want to be like your dad, but you don't know anything about him?"
1148,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I was raised by Mito-san, so I've only seen my dad in pictures."
1149,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Who's Mito-san?
1150,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Aunt Mito.
1151,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Oh...
1152,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"When he was twelve, \Nmy dad took the Hunter Exam."
1153,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He passed and became a Hunter.
1154,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Then he left the island.
1155,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I want to find out why he \Nchose to be a Hunter over being with me.
1156,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The exit!
1157,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Whew...
1158,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Finally, I can get out of this dark tunnel!"
1159,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Now, let's see how many made it this far."
1160,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Goal!
1161,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Yay! I win.
1162,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What are you talking about?
1163,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I was faster...
1164,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I was.
1165,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"No, I was!"
1166,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I was faster, so you have to buy dinner!"
1167,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Nope!
1168,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I was faster.
1169,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,So you buy me dinner.
1170,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,But I was faster.
1171,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, who was faster?"
1172,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I believe that you crossed the \Nfinish line simultaneously.
1173,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Oh...
1174,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Then I'll buy you dinner.
1175,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1176,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Then you buy me dinner!
1177,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I don't get it.
1178,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, Satotz-san."
1179,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Is this where the Second Phase \Nof the exam takes place?
1180,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"No, we still have quite a way to go."
1181,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Oh...
1182,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Hey, Kurapika!"
1183,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Is this our destination?
1184,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"No, it isn't."
1185,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I see.
1186,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The fog is fading.
1187,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Really?
1188,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"The Numere Wetlands, also known as Swindlers Swamp."
1189,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We must cross these wetlands to \Nreach Phase Two of the exam.
1190,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"This place is home to many bizarre animals, many of them being cunning, insatiable creatures who deceive humans and prey upon them."
1191,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Be very careful.
1192,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,If you let them fool you...
1193,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,...you're dead.
1194,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Wait for me!
1195,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,These wetland creatures will use every trick in the book to fool their prey.
1196,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,An ecosystem in which creatures \Nobtain food through deceit...
1197,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Hence the name Swindlers Swamp.
1198,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Stay very close to me so you won't be deceived.
1199,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What a joke.
1200,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"How can they fool us, \Nwhen we're expecting it?"
1201,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Don't let them fool you!
1202,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I just said that they can't.
1203,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,D-Don't fall for it...
1204,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He's lying to you!
1205,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He's an impostor!
1206,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He isn't an examiner...
1207,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I'm the real examiner.
1208,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,An impostor?
1209,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What's going on?
1210,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Then who is he?
1211,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Look at this...
1212,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He looks just like Satotz-san!
1213,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"It's a Man-Faced Ape, one of the creatures \Nthat dwell in the Numere Wetlands!"
1214,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,A Man-Faced Ape?
1215,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Man-Faced Apes love the taste \Nof fresh human flesh.
1216,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"However, their limbs are long and thin, \Nso they're quite weak."
1217,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That's why they disguise themselves as humans.
1218,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"They trick humans into following them \Ninto these wetlands, where they team up with other animals \Nto kill and devour them."
1219,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He intends to trap every single applicant!
1220,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Bastard...
1221,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,He certainly doesn't walk like a human...
1222,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1223,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"I see, I see..."
1224,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,That settles it...
1225,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You're the real one.
1226,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,What? He's the real examiner?
1227,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Huh?
1228,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Examiners are Hunters selected by the committee to perform \Nthis duty without pay.
1229,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek, would have been able to block that attack."
1230,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I shall take that as a compliment.
1231,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"However, should you attack me again, \Nfor any reason,"
1232,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I will report you for turning \Non an examiner.
1233,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,And you will be immediately disqualified.
1234,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Are we clear?
1235,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Sure.
1236,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Nature really can be brutal to watch...
1237,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"So he was a Man-Faced Ape, as well."
1238,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"He was attempting to confuse \Nthe applicants, to lure some of them away."
1239,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,We cannot relax our guard.
1240,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Yeah.
1241,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,You will be encountering such \Ndeception on a regular basis.
1242,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,I believe that a number of you were fooled into suspecting my identity?
1243,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Do you understand?
1244,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"If you lose sight of me in \Nthe Numere Wetlands fog, you will never reach the exam's Second Phase."
1245,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Do bear that in mind.
1246,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Then let us be on our way.
1247,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Please follow me.
1248,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Tsk, another marathon."
1249,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,And we're running through marsh this time.
1250,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Running on wet ground requires more energy.
1251,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"The applicants have finally escaped \Nthe long, dark tunnel."
1252,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Thus far, 36 candidates have \Nwithdrawn from the exam, leaving 368 remaining applicants."
1253,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,"Their next challenge is the Numere Wetlands, also known as Swindlers Swamp."
1254,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,The brutal Hunter Exam continues.
1255,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Next time: Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!
1256,Hope x And x Ambition.,4,Okey-dokey!
1257,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
1258,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
1259,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
1260,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
1261,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
1262,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,They are known...
1263,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,...as Hunters!
1264,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"I see, I see..."
1265,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,That settles it...
1266,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,You're the real one.
1267,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Examiners are Hunters selected by the committee to perform \Nthis duty without pay.
1268,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Any Hunter, bearing the title we seek, would have been able to block that attack."
1269,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I shall take that as a compliment.
1270,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"However, should you attack me again, \Nfor any reason,"
1271,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I will report you for turning \Non an examiner.
1272,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,And you will be immediately disqualified.
1273,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Are we clear?
1274,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Sure.
1275,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky
1276,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"The 368 applicants who made it through \Nthe long underground tunnel find themselves in an unexplored land \Nteeming with strange creatures, known as the Numere Wetlands."
1277,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Pay attention now.
1278,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Be sure to stay close behind me.
1279,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,The fog is getting thicker.
1280,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,All right...
1281,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,This is our chance.
1282,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We'll take advantage of the fog \Nto get rid of him!
1283,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Gon...
1284,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh?
1285,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Let's move up.
1286,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Okay.
1287,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We don't want to lose sight \Nof the examiner.
1288,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I'm more concerned with increasing the distance between \Nus and Hisoka.
1289,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Staying too close to him is dangerous.
1290,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I can smell it in the air.
1291,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Smell?
1292,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hmm...
1293,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I don't think he smells.
1294,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Leorio! Kurapika!
1295,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Killua says that we should move up!
1296,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hey...
1297,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Can't you feel the tension \Nsurrounding us?
1298,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Moron!
1299,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"If I had the strength, \NI'd already be there!"
1300,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Don't worry about us!
1301,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What?
1302,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Let's go, Gon."
1303,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Ah, wait!"
1304,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We can't even tell \Nwhich way we're going.
1305,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It's okay.
1306,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,As long as we don't lose sight \Nof the guys ahead of us...
1307,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What's going on?
1308,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Wh-What?
1309,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Noggin Luggin' Tortoise
1310,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,This looks bad...
1311,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Claymore Mushrooms
1312,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh? What?
1313,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,A butterfly?
1314,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hypnosis Butterfly
1315,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Damn!
1316,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Which way are we supposed to go?
1317,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Did we lose sight of him?
1318,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Pay attention now.
1319,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Be sure to stay close behind me.
1320,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Over there!
1321,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Pay attention now.
1322,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Caw!
1323,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Be sure to stay close behind me.
1324,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Ruse Raven
1325,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Caw!
1326,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,That thing can imitate human speech?
1327,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Close call...
1328,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Yeah...
1329,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I hear people screaming all around us.
1330,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Just stay on your guard.
1331,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I wonder if Leorio and \NKurapika are okay...
1332,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Mm?
1333,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Frog-in-Waiting
1334,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Leorio!
1335,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Ouch.
1336,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Leorio, here's our opportunity."
1337,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Y-Yeah...
1338,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Guess he didn't like the taste of us.
1339,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It was this.
1340,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,That was from Tonpa-san!
1341,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Guess he saved us.
1342,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Well, I could have escaped."
1343,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I'm still worried about Leorio and Kurapika.
1344,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Forget about them. Let's get a move on.
1345,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We can still catch up to the examiner.
1346,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We've lost sight of the front-runners.
1347,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Which way should we go?
1348,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Stop!
1349,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Over there...
1350,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"When I saw you last year,"
1351,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I knew you weren't Hunter material.
1352,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We'll spare you if you swear not to \Ntake the Hunter Exam again.
1353,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Sure.
1354,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh?
1355,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"I'm passing the exam this year, so I won't need to retake it."
1356,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Passing?
1357,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Idiot!
1358,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Look at this fog.
1359,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It's impossible to determine which \Ndirection the main pack went!
1360,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Meaning we've all failed the exam!
1361,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,So that's why.
1362,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Having already failed, you wish \Nto play examiner."
1363,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hunters require prey.
1364,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Why don't I play examiner...
1365,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,And judge whether you \Nare Hunter material?
1366,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Shut up!
1367,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Now, then..."
1368,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,H-H-Help!
1369,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hel—
1370,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Well?
1371,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Care to participate, in my little game of examiner?"
1372,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hunter Vocabulary
1373,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Satotz
1374,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Cool...
1375,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"We've caught up to the \Nmain group, Gon."
1376,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh?
1377,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Where'd he go?
1378,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Leorio.
1379,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"On my signal, we run in \Nopposite directions."
1380,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What?
1381,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,He is vastly more experienced \Nin real combat.
1382,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,The two of us won't stand a \Nchance against him.
1383,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We cannot afford to squander time \Nin a pointless fight!
1384,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Now!
1385,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I see...
1386,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,A wise decision.
1387,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hmm?
1388,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I just can't do it...
1389,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"This may not be my fight, but I won't close my eyes and make a break for it!"
1390,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Leorio?!
1391,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Mm, I adore that look on your face."
1392,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What?
1393,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Gon?
1394,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I made it in time...
1395,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Not bad, little boy."
1396,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Is that a fishing pole?
1397,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What a fascinating weapon.
1398,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Allow me a closer look.
1399,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Your fight is with me!
1400,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,You came to rescue your friend?
1401,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Such a good boy.
1402,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,And that expression...
1403,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Nice...
1404,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Very nice.
1405,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I'm getting excited now...
1406,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Okay!
1407,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,How wonderful...
1408,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I really do love that look.
1409,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Do not fear.
1410,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I will not kill your friend.
1411,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,He passed.
1412,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Yes, you pass, as well."
1413,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Grow up and become a fine Hunter.
1414,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Hisoka, you should get back here."
1415,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,We're nearly at the Phase Two site.
1416,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Okay, I'll be right there."
1417,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It's always good to have friends.
1418,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"You can find your own way back, yes?"
1419,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,That's a good boy.
1420,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Gon!
1421,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Are you all right?
1422,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh?
1423,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Gon isn't here...
1424,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,This way.
1425,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,You can really tell?
1426,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Uh-huh.
1427,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Leorio's cologne is very unique.
1428,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I can smell him from a \Nfew kilometers away.
1429,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Say, Kurapika..."
1430,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,What did Hisoka mean when \Nhe said that we passed?
1431,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hisoka was acting as a judge.
1432,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,A judge?
1433,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Yes.
1434,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,He must have his own benchmarks \Nfor evaluating power.
1435,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It's possible that he was ascertaining \Neach applicant's strength.
1436,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Apparently, you and Leorio must \Nhave met his standards."
1437,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I see.
1438,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,But I was powerless to do \Nanything against him.
1439,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Didn't you land your first hit on him?
1440,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Only because I surprised him.
1441,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Besides, Leorio passed, \Neven though he lost..."
1442,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Hmm...
1443,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Perhaps he sensed that you \Nwere kindred spirits.
1444,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Kindred spirits?
1445,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I seriously doubt that Hisoka \Ncould qualify as a Hunter.
1446,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"However,"
1447,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,I must admit that he did impress me with his superhuman agility \Nand graceful technique.
1448,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,It's quite common that those possessing special talents are drawn \Nto others with unique gifts.
1449,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Most likely, Hisoka's instincts \Nand experience told him that you had the skill and \Npotential to become Hunters."
1450,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Killing you now would have been a waste...
1451,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,That was his perspective.
1452,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Oh, I'm sorry!"
1453,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Was that insensitive on my part?
1454,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,No...
1455,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"But I was pretty excited, as well."
1456,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"I was so scared, I wanted to run away."
1457,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,But I couldn't.
1458,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"And at the same time, I was excited."
1459,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Isn't that strange?
1460,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"For the first time in his life, \NGon has experienced mortal fear."
1461,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Though the unfamiliar feelings \Naccompanying that fear confuse Gon, he cannot restrain his growing curiosity."
1462,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"At this stage, 220 candidates have \Nwithdrawn from the exam, leaving 148 remaining applicants."
1463,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Next time: A x Surprising x Challenge!
1464,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,S-Surprisingly challenging.
1465,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,Huh?
1466,Hisoka x Is x Sneaky!,5,"Gon, are you okay?"
1467,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
1468,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
1469,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
1470,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
1471,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
1472,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,They are known...
1473,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,...as Hunters!
1474,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,How wonderful...
1475,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I really do love that look.
1476,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"But I was pretty excited, as well."
1477,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"I was so scared, I wanted to run away."
1478,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,But I couldn't.
1479,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"And at the same time, I was excited."
1480,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Isn't that strange?
1481,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,A x Surprising x Challenge
1482,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Looks like we made it in time.
1483,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Leorio...
1484,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Leorio!
1485,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Man, that stings..."
1486,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Why am I all beat up?
1487,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1488,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,My memory is kinda hazy.
1489,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,We probably shouldn't tell \Nhim what happened.
1490,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Yeah...
1491,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Gon.
1492,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Killua!
1493,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I can't believe you actually got here...
1494,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I thought you were done for.
1495,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I just tracked Leorio's cologne.
1496,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Cologne?
1497,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That was how?
1498,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You definitely are weird.
1499,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Excellent work, everyone."
1500,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Phase Two of the exam will occur here, \Nin the Biska Forest Park."
1501,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"So, I shall take my leave."
1502,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Best of luck to all of you.
1503,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Will all applicants who passed \Nthe First Phase please enter?
1504,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Welcome.
1505,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner."
1506,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"And I'm Buhara, the other examiner."
1507,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wh-What was that sound?
1508,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You must be hungry.
1509,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm starving...
1510,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There you have it. \NPhase Two will involve...
1511,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,...cooking!
1512,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,C-Cooking?
1513,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wait! Cooking?
1514,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,We're here to take the Hunter Exam!
1515,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That's quite right.
1516,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce \Na dish that will satisfy our palate.
1517,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Why do we have to cook?!
1518,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That's because we are Gourmet Hunters.
1519,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1520,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Man, what a letdown."
1521,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,They're Gourmet Hunters...
1522,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...
1523,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Their selection as examiners \Ncould prove problematic.
1524,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Only fifty applicants...
1525,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"No, depending on the task, it's possible that fewer than ten \Napplicants will pass Phase Two."
1526,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"So, Gourmet Hunters, \Nwhat are we supposed to make?"
1527,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Buhara.
1528,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The required ingredient is pork.
1529,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Pork?
1530,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,As in pig meat?
1531,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You're free to use meat from any \Nspecies of Biska Forest pigs.
1532,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You must use the cooking facilities here \Nto prepare the pork.
1533,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And you only pass if we both \Nfind it delicious.
1534,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And we will evaluate more \Nthan just the taste.
1535,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Don't underestimate the \Nintricacies of cooking.
1536,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Got it?
1537,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"When we've both eaten our fill, the exam will end."
1538,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,We get it. We get it.
1539,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Let's just start.
1540,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Then, the exam's Second Phase begins now!"
1541,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Free to use meat from any species of pigs?
1542,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You have a real nasty streak.
1543,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Choosing the ingredients was my job.
1544,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Only one species of pig lives in \Nthe Biska Forest, correct?"
1545,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I hope they don't get themselves killed.
1546,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Hey, little piggy?"
1547,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Catch a pig and cook it.
1548,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This is way easier than the First Phase.
1549,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I hope it will be that simple...
1550,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"What was that about, Gon?!"
1551,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Found them.
1552,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1553,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Pigs!
1554,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Uh... They're chewing on bones.
1555,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Don't tell me...
1556,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,They're carnivores?
1557,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1558,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What's that?
1559,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,These pigs are crazy!
1560,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"The Great Stamp, the world's most ferocious pig."
1561,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"They use their large, stout noses \Nto send their enemies flying."
1562,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"If you're too slow, you'll end up \Nas their dinner."
1563,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Take that!
1564,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What?
1565,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1566,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Just maybe...
1567,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Could their foreheads be \Ntheir weak points?
1568,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"So, the pigs evolved large, strong noses in order to protect \Ntheir soft foreheads."
1569,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Oh, my. They caught a lot."
1570,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This year's applicants are very talented.
1571,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"However, the difficult part is yet to come."
1572,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Now eat the pig and send me \Nto the next phase.
1573,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Okay, it's evaluation time."
1574,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Taste testing.
1575,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Tastes good!
1576,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's overcooked.
1577,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The tough texture ruins the \Nflavor of the meat.
1578,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What? You haven't even tried it!
1579,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's plain as day.
1580,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Damn it...
1581,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Okay... Dive in!
1582,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh? Why?
1583,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Charred on the outside, \Nuncooked inside."
1584,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Your fire was too strong.
1585,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Honestly...
1586,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"All they're doing is roasting the whole pig, \Nlike it's all they know how to do..."
1587,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,None of them has made any effort!
1588,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,No one's passed yet...
1589,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...
1590,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Hey!
1591,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Can't anyone out there satisfy me?
1592,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That's it!
1593,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"This phase of the exam is a cooking test, but they're judging us on originality \Nand powers of observation."
1594,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I see...
1595,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,How do you like my cooking?
1596,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!
1597,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm next!
1598,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's basically the same thing!
1599,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I am next!
1600,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Please judge my creation.
1601,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Finally, something that \Nresembles an actual dish..."
1602,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"The point is to use the provided \Nfacilities and ingredients to highlight the main feature, the pork."
1603,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"In other words, the taste is insignificant!"
1604,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Yuck!
1605,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1606,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Appearance is important, but only if it also tastes good."
1607,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You're no better than #403!
1608,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Too bad!
1609,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,No better than #403...
1610,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"That was so much food,"
1611,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm stuffed!
1612,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Yeah, I'm stuffed, too."
1613,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Therefore, no one passes."
1614,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,We're finished here!
1615,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's over?
1616,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What the hell?
1617,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"As I expected, she's lapsed back \Ninto her old bad habits."
1618,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"What should we do, Chairman?"
1619,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I suppose I have no choice.
1620,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Fine, I'll have to go in person."
1621,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Hunter Vocabulary
1622,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Menchi
1623,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Zero people passed?
1624,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Are you serious?
1625,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Does she really mean it?
1626,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The exam is over?
1627,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This isn't funny!
1628,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I won't accept it...
1629,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I absolutely refuse to accept this!
1630,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"In the end, you've still failed."
1631,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Stop screwing around!
1632,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"You asked for pork, so we risked our lives to—"
1633,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I said to prepare the pork in a manner we both found delicious...
1634,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,None of you made anything \Nremotely delicious.
1635,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You all did almost the same thing.
1636,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There was no effort made...
1637,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Just when I thought someone actually tried, \Nthey only changed the appearance."
1638,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.
1639,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm positive that none of you \Ntook cooking seriously!
1640,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Pork dishes are all the same...
1641,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Just say that once more.
1642,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Any more crap from you, and I'll shove my arm up your ass \Nand knock your teeth out!"
1643,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Don't you mess with me!
1644,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There's Menchi's bad habit again...
1645,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I don't want any lip from a bunch of
1646,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"After all, only a handful of chefs amateurs who can't even roast a pig! in the entire world can satisfy Menchi."
1647,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Hey! What did you just say?
1648,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Why don't you repeat it to my face?!
1649,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"In other words, you people don't have the guts to try anything new."
1650,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Shut up!
1651,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm not trying to become \Na cook or a gourmet...
1652,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I want to be a Hunter!
1653,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Yeah! Yeah!
1654,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.
1655,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter \Ndecide my fate!
1656,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Too bad you got stuck with a mere
1657,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...
1658,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Better luck next year?
1659,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Why, you..."
1660,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Don't mock me!
1661,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Buhara, don't interfere."
1662,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Well...
1663,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"If I hadn't intervened, \Nyou'd have killed him, right?"
1664,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Probably.
1665,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Let me clarify this...
1666,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"We frequently venture into the dens of ferocious beasts, \Nsearching for ingredients."
1667,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Every Hunter knows some form \Nof martial art.
1668,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You lack focus and the willingness \Nto experiment.
1669,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That alone disqualifies you \Nfrom becoming Hunters!
1670,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"That said, it would be excessive to fail \Nevery single applicant."
1671,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That's the symbol of the \NHunters Association!
1672,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Is it someone from the \NSelection Committee?
1673,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wh-Who's that geezer?
1674,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The Chairman of the \NSelection Committee.
1675,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...
1676,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Chairman Netero.
1677,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Well, I work behind the scenes."
1678,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"I only take action when there's \Nan issue, like now."
1679,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"So, Menchi-kun..."
1680,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Yes, sir."
1681,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You failed all of the applicants because you disapproved of their reluctance to try new things?
1682,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"No, sir..."
1683,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I lost my cool when one \Nof the candidates insulted Gourmet Hunters.
1684,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And I made the exam harder \Nthan necessary.
1685,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"In other words, you're aware that \Nthis exam was unacceptable."
1686,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Yes, sir."
1687,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"When cooking is involved, \NI lose control."
1688,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm unqualified to be an examiner.
1689,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"I will resign as examiner, so please redo the Second Phase!"
1690,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,But it would be difficult to find another examiner on such short notice.
1691,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I apologize...
1692,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Very well. How about this?
1693,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'd like you to continue serving \Nas an examiner.
1694,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,But you must also participate in the new test you propose.
1695,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Is that acceptable?
1696,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'm certain that will help the applicants to accept the results.
1697,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That's true...
1698,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Then the new challenge will be boiled eggs!
1699,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Boiled eggs?
1700,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Chairman, can you take us \Nto Mt. Split-in-Half in your airship?"
1701,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Mt. Split-in-Half?
1702,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I see what you're doing.
1703,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Certainly, I can."
1704,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Now, everyone..."
1705,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Look down there.
1706,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wh-What is that?
1707,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,A Spider Eagle's web.
1708,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,They build webs down there?
1709,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Look below the web.
1710,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Those are...
1711,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Those are Spider Eagle eggs.
1712,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines, to protect their eggs from predators."
1713,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This makes their eggs one of the most difficult \Ningredients to obtain.
1714,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The eggs are also known as dream eggs.
1715,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,W-Wait a minute...
1716,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,You don't mean we...
1717,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I sure do.
1718,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What?
1719,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Even if she can grab some eggs, how will she climb back up?"
1720,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Hey... She jumped down!
1721,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Is she trying to kill herself?
1722,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"No, she's not."
1723,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Huh?
1724,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,That looks fun...
1725,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This ravine has updrafts that help the hatched chicks \Nfly up to the web.
1726,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There. Now I just need to boil the egg.
1727,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Y-You must be joking.
1728,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,No reasonable person would \Njump down there...
1729,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I've been waiting for this!
1730,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Okay! Count me in!
1731,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wait!
1732,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I haven't finished explaining everything!
1733,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Catch you later.
1734,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Let's go!
1735,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Not yet.
1736,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Why not?
1737,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There's no wind.
1738,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,There isn't always an updraft.
1739,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,When's the next one?
1740,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Wait.
1741,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,What?
1742,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,The web won't hold us all!
1743,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Gon, not yet?"
1744,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!"
1745,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's gonna snap!
1746,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Now!
1747,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,And the rest of you?
1748,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I guess you quit.
1749,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"It takes courage to concede, too."
1750,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,This is damned good.
1751,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Much better than the eggs \Nyou buy in a store...
1752,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I can see why they're \Ncalled dream eggs.
1753,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"Hey, Todo-san."
1754,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Would you like a bite?
1755,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,It's delicious...
1756,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Now you've experienced the joy \Nof discovering how good something can taste.
1757,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,We're risking our lives for that joy.
1758,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I was completely outclassed this year.
1759,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,I'll be back next year!
1760,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,"The applicants have learned that, whether you're a Black List Hunter \Nor a Gourmet Hunter, calling yourself a Hunter requires an \Nenormous amount of determination."
1761,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Only 42 applicants remain.
1762,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!
1763,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,Use soap when you wash your hands!
1764,A x Surprising x Challenge!,6,R-Right!
1765,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
1766,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
1767,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
1768,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
1769,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
1770,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,They are known...
1771,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,...as Hunters!
1772,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Now!
1773,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Now you've experienced the joy \Nof discovering how good something can taste.
1774,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We're risking our lives for that joy.
1775,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Showdown x On The x Airship
1776,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"After clearing the exam's Second Phase,"
1777,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Gon and his friends fly through the starry sky, toward the site for the Third Phase."
1778,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Allow me to introduce myself to the \Nforty-two remaining applicants.
1779,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I am Netero, Chairman of this year's \NHunter Exam Selection Committee."
1780,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I am his secretary, Beans."
1781,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Originally, I'd planned to \Nmake my appearance during the exam's final phase, \Nbut as I'm already here..."
1782,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm loving this tension in the air!
1783,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,So I think I'll stick around for \Nthe rest of the trip.
1784,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"We are scheduled to arrive at our destination \Ntomorrow morning, at 8 AM."
1785,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You'll find dinner waiting in the dining hall.
1786,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You are also welcome to get some rest.
1787,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"In other words, you're free to do as you please \Nuntil you are contacted."
1788,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Okay, Gon! Let's explore the airship!"
1789,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Yeah!
1790,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,How can they have so much energy?
1791,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm hitting the sack.
1792,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You can say that again.
1793,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"However, I do have one concern..."
1794,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hmm? What's up?
1795,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,How many more phases are there?
1796,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Oh...
1797,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"They've never mentioned that, \Nhave they?"
1798,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"On average, there are five to six phases."
1799,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Which means we still have \Nthree or four to go...
1800,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,All the more reason to rest now.
1801,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But you should be careful.
1802,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh?
1803,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,The secretary only told us when \Nwe'll arrive at our destination.
1804,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's possible that the third exam could take place on this airship itself.
1805,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,And it doesn't necessarily mean we'll \Nbe contacted at 8 AM.
1806,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh? Are you serious?
1807,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Hmm, that does make sense..."
1808,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You might wake up to discover that \Nthe exam has already ended.
1809,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If you plan to make it to the next phase, don't let yourself relax on this airship."
1810,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What the hell...
1811,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Well, that was some good advice."
1812,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Thanks.
1813,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We shall bear that in mind.
1814,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Let's all do our best.
1815,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Yeah, right..."
1816,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Here's hoping that you're \Nboth nervous wrecks, come the morning."
1817,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,There's no chance that the next phase \Nwill be held on the airship.
1818,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Were that their intention, they wouldn't have said that we were \Nfree to do as we pleased."
1819,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,They would have told us to stand by.
1820,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Hey, how many applicants \Ndo you expect to make it?"
1821,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You mean pass the exam?
1822,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Yep. This year, we have \Nan impressive group."
1823,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Though I did fail them all at one point...
1824,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But doesn't it depend on what the upcoming phases consist of?
1825,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,That's true...
1826,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But didn't you notice it?
1827,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,One of them had this whole \Naura thing going on.
1828,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"What do you think, Satotz?"
1829,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Oh, yes."
1830,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I like the rookies this year.
1831,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Ha! So you agree?
1832,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I think #294 has a good shot.
1833,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm partial to #99.
1834,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"He looks like a selfish, spoiled brat."
1835,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"What do you think, Buhara?"
1836,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Well...
1837,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"He isn't a rookie, \Nbut #44 is the one I favor."
1838,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I'm sure you noticed, but when #255 was throwing a fit, it was #44 who was really on the verge \Nof killing someone."
1839,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I did notice that, of course."
1840,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He could barely restrain himself \Nfrom tearing off our heads.
1841,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But didn't you realize?
1842,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He was already that way from the first moment we appeared.
1843,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Really?
1844,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Yeah, that's the real reason \NI was so edgy."
1845,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He kept challenging me.
1846,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I had a similar experience.
1847,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He should be carefully monitored.
1848,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Though it pains me to admit this, we are birds of a feather with him."
1849,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"However, his affinity \Nfor darkness is far stronger."
1850,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"As Hunters, we are continually \Nseeking out rivals."
1851,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Ultimately, the Hunter Exam is but a place to find opponents \Nworthy of respect."
1852,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"And every once in a while, we encounter someone who hits the floor running, when we try to slow things down."
1853,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,An oddball of sorts.
1854,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Hey, there! Kids!"
1855,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Stay out of the kitchen!
1856,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Go eat in the dining hall!
1857,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Wow, awesome!"
1858,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Look, Gon!"
1859,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hmm? What is it?
1860,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Whoa!
1861,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's like the ground is covered in jewels!
1862,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Yeah!
1863,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Hey, I was wondering..."
1864,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hmm?
1865,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Where are your mom and dad?
1866,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hmm... They're alive.
1867,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Probably.
1868,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What do they do?
1869,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,They're assassins.
1870,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh? Both of them?
1871,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,That's your first reaction?
1872,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You really are a riot!
1873,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh?
1874,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You're the first person who's \Never responded seriously.
1875,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Well, you're telling the truth, right?"
1876,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What makes you think that?
1877,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's just a hunch.
1878,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,That's weird...
1879,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,People only like me because they can't ever tell \Nwhether I'm serious.
1880,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm from a family of assassins.
1881,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,So they're all assassins.
1882,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,And my family has really high hopes for me...
1883,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But I can't stand it.
1884,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Who wants to have their life \Nplanned out for them?
1885,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"When I told them I wanted to \Ndecide my own future, they all snapped!"
1886,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"My mother had tears streaming down her face, as she told me"
1887,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I have the potential to be a top assassin.
1888,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Horrible parents, right?"
1889,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's natural their kid would go bad.
1890,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We ended up fighting.
1891,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"So I stabbed my mother in the face, my brother in the side, and ran away from home."
1892,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm sure they're out for blood now.
1893,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"But if they find me, \NI'll send them packing."
1894,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"When I become a Hunter,"
1895,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'll start by capturing my family.
1896,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm sure they're worth some \Nhefty bounties...
1897,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Something wrong?
1898,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Ah, Netero-san..."
1899,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Did you see anyone coming from that side?
1900,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,No.
1901,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,When did he...
1902,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You're pretty fast for an old man.
1903,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,That little trick?
1904,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I barely moved.
1905,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What do you want?
1906,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"You don't have to do anything until the last phase, right?"
1907,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,No need to be so unkind.
1908,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I got bored, and was looking \Nfor some companions."
1909,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"By the way, I meant to ask \Nthe two of you..."
1910,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Any thoughts on your first attempt \Nat the Hunter Examination?
1911,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Uh-huh! It's fun!
1912,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,And there haven't been any of the \Nwritten exams I was dreading.
1913,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm disappointed...
1914,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I expected the exam to be \Nfar more difficult.
1915,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I assume the next phase will \Nbe more entertaining?
1916,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Well, now... \NI wouldn't know about that."
1917,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Let's go, Gon!"
1918,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Now wait just a moment.
1919,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Would you care to play a game with me?
1920,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,A game?
1921,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If you're able to defeat me, \NI shall let you be Hunters!"
1922,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Really? I'll play!
1923,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"How about it, eh?"
1924,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hunter Vocabulary
1925,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Netero
1926,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Now, I'll go over the rules of the game."
1927,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If you can take this ball from me, before the airship reaches \Nits destination, you win."
1928,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I believe that we're scheduled \Nfor an 8 AM arrival?
1929,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Well, that still gives you nine hours."
1930,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You're free to attack me \Nhowever you'd like.
1931,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I won't touch you.
1932,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh? That's too easy.
1933,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You can't call that a game.
1934,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Why not give it a try first?
1935,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We just have to take the ball?
1936,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Yeah.
1937,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Then I'll go first.
1938,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Go ahead.
1939,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He's looking down on me.
1940,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I see lots of Killuas!
1941,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,This is an assassination technique.
1942,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Rhythm Echo...
1943,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Practitioners use a certain rhythm \Nto create after-images, confusing the enemy."
1944,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I am astonished that such a young child has already mastered that technique.
1945,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Damn, he keeps darting around."
1946,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Is he really an old man?
1947,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What? That's it?
1948,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"In that case,"
1949,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'll stop his movement!
1950,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Ouch... Right on his pivot leg!
1951,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Ow!
1952,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He didn't hold back with that kick.
1953,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If I were an ordinary person, \Nthat would have shattered my leg."
1954,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Damn...
1955,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,His legs are hard as iron...
1956,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Killua!
1957,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Tag! Tag!
1958,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's my turn!
1959,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What will this kid try?
1960,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He appears to be a very honest boy.
1961,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Okay!
1962,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Oh... He has a quick first step.
1963,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But he'd need another ten years before attacking me head-on.
1964,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I guess he is just a child.
1965,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh? From above?
1966,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Ow!
1967,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Idiot!
1968,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We know that you can jump \Nreally high!
1969,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Control your strength!
1970,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"For a moment, the old man \Nrelaxed his guard!"
1971,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,No kidding...
1972,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"He may appear simple-minded, \Nbut he clearly uses his head."
1973,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I messed up there.
1974,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,They should keep me entertained \Nuntil the morning.
1975,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Those two were pretty shaken.
1976,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I bet they're too nervous to get a wink of sleep...
1977,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,They're sound asleep?
1978,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You boys aren't getting anywhere.
1979,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Why not attack simultaneously?
1980,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Why, you..."
1981,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Okay... I'll get you this time!
1982,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Here they come.
1983,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Netero-san hasn't even broken a sweat.
1984,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Ow!
1985,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,So we can't beat him \Nwithout subterfuge.
1986,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Your attacks are getting boring.
1987,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,He kicked off his shoe to \Nincrease his range?
1988,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,A chance!
1989,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I think not.
1990,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You and your little tricks!
1991,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's mine!
1992,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I commend you on your efforts.
1993,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"You're amazing, Netero-san!"
1994,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Really amazing!
1995,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Forget it...
1996,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I give up.
1997,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I lose!
1998,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh?
1999,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Oh? He's quitting?
2000,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Why? We still have time.
2001,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"And just now, we came really close."
2002,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Jeez. You really have no clue, do you?"
2003,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,The old man has barely used his \Nright hand and his left leg.
2004,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,What?
2005,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,But we're still powerless against him.
2006,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"We could chase him around for a year, and never take the ball from him."
2007,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Oh, you figured it out?"
2008,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"And here, I thought I'd fooled you."
2009,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,So that's what he was doing.
2010,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"You really know how to \Npiss me off, old man."
2011,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Let's go, Gon!"
2012,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Oh, I'm gonna play a little longer."
2013,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Huh?
2014,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Didn't you hear what I said?!
2015,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's useless!
2016,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You won't be able to take \Nthe ball from him!
2017,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Yeah! I don't care about the ball.
2018,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,We've only used up half \Nof the time limit.
2019,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm gonna make Netero-san \Nuse his right hand before the time runs out.
2020,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I see...
2021,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Yeah, I got it."
2022,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Good luck.
2023,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'm getting some sleep.
2024,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Say, Netero-san..."
2025,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hmm?
2026,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"How did Killua do that thing \Nwhere he walked slowly, and it looked like there were \Na bunch of Killuas?"
2027,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,That technique is for those engaged \Nin underground work.
2028,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You have no need to learn it.
2029,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"In fact, you should not learn it."
2030,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"But it's an amazing technique, right?"
2031,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It requires an intensive amount \Nof training.
2032,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Killua's really something!
2033,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You fool.
2034,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Damn it! Now I'm in a bad mood.
2035,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Well, I guess there's \Nnothing for it."
2036,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hey.
2037,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Wait up, kid."
2038,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"You bump into us, \Nand then ignore us?"
2039,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Bastard!
2040,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If I hadn't stopped then,"
2041,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'd have ended up killing that \Nold man to get the ball.
2042,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Oh, he's moving faster."
2043,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Here it comes!
2044,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"He'll feint for the ball, but attack my stomach!"
2045,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,O-Ouch!
2046,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,One more!
2047,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"If he head-butts me in the stomach again, he'll shatter his skull."
2048,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"But if I relax my stomach, \NI'll be the one suffering."
2049,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I'll run away.
2050,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Ah, is he dead?"
2051,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,You just used your right hand!
2052,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I did it!
2053,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Hooray...
2054,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Hello, helmsman?"
2055,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,It's me. Is the flight going well?
2056,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,I see.
2057,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"I'm sorry to ruin it for you, but could you fly a little slower?"
2058,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"During a game Netero proposed to kill time, he's seen something in Gon."
2059,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,The airship and its 42 applicants approach the site of the exam's Third Phase.
2060,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Next time: Decision x By x Majority?
2061,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,"Majority, majority..."
2062,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Authority!
2063,Showdown x On The x Airship!,7,Minority?
2064,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
2065,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
2066,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
2067,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
2068,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
2069,Decision x By x Majority?,8,They are known...
2070,Decision x By x Majority?,8,...as Hunters!
2071,Decision x By x Majority?,8,One more!
2072,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You just used your right hand!
2073,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I did it!
2074,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Hooray...
2075,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Decision x By x Majority?
2076,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Dawn breaks, as the airship carrying Gon and his friends approaches its destination."
2077,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam \Nis about to begin.
2078,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I apologize for the long wait.
2079,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The airship will soon arrive \Nat its destination.
2080,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wow!
2081,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Is that where the next test will be held?
2082,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What is this place?
2083,Decision x By x Majority?,8,There's nothing here.
2084,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Ahem...
2085,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Everyone, the exam's Third Phase \Nwill begin here, at the top of Trick Tower."
2086,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Trick Tower?
2087,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"To pass this phase, you must reach the tower's base alive."
2088,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The time limit is seventy-two hours.
2089,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"With that, we will now begin \Nthe Third Phase."
2090,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I will pray for your success.
2091,Decision x By x Majority?,8,No way.
2092,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So it's finally my turn?
2093,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Best of luck to everyone!
2094,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Are we supposed to climb down?
2095,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That would be suicide...
2096,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Maybe for a normal person.
2097,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"But a top-class rock climber can \Nhandle this, no problem."
2098,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wow...
2099,Decision x By x Majority?,8,He's going down pretty fast.
2100,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Looks like I'll be the first one \Nto pass the Third Phase...
2101,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Stop! Stay away!
2102,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Stop! Stop it!
2103,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Help!
2104,Decision x By x Majority?,8,G-Guess we can't climb down the side...
2105,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Yeah.
2106,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What's up?
2107,Decision x By x Majority?,8,There are fewer people around.
2108,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What?
2109,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"I count twenty-three, which suggests almost half of the \Napplicants have already found an exit."
2110,Decision x By x Majority?,8,No way. When did they do that?
2111,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That means there must be some hidden doors that lead below.
2112,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Kurapika! Leorio!
2113,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"What is it, Gon?"
2114,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Look. I found a hidden door.
2115,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I see now.
2116,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So we can descend by flipping the stones.
2117,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Okay!
2118,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Great job, Gon!"
2119,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Let's head on down!
2120,Decision x By x Majority?,8,But I'm confused.
2121,Decision x By x Majority?,8,About what?
2122,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"There are also hidden doors here, \Nthere, over there, and over there, as well."
2123,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That many?
2124,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Five hidden doors, \Nlocated in the same area."
2125,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It sounds suspicious to me.
2126,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Some could be traps.
2127,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And it looks as though each door can only be used once...
2128,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Seriously?
2129,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"We tried opening a door \Nsomeone else used, but it wouldn't budge."
2130,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Judging by the door's size, only one can fit at a time."
2131,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"In other words, only one person \Ncan use each door."
2132,Decision x By x Majority?,8,We'll have to split up.
2133,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Gon and I decided that we're each \Ngoing to choose a door.
2134,Decision x By x Majority?,8,No hard feelings if one \Nof us springs a trap!
2135,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What are you guys gonna do?
2136,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I can live with that.
2137,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Luck is part of the game...
2138,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I have no objection.
2139,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Then that settles it.
2140,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Let's go, on the count of three."
2141,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I guess this is goodbye for now.
2142,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"We'll meet up again, at the tower's base."
2143,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Let's go...
2144,Decision x By x Majority?,8,One!
2145,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Two!
2146,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Three!
2147,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?
2148,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh? What?
2149,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That was quite a brief farewell.
2150,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Oh, so all the doors led to the same room..."
2151,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"""The five of you must follow the will of the majority \Nto reach the goal."""
2152,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Five of us?
2153,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Look... There are five stopwatches.
2154,Decision x By x Majority?,8,There's an O and an X button.
2155,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Could it be that we won't be \Nable to leave this room until another person drops in?
2156,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That is correct!
2157,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Who's that?!
2158,Decision x By x Majority?,8,My name is Lippo.
2159,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"I am the prison warden here, as well as the Third Phase examiner."
2160,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Prison warden?
2161,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Multiple routes through this tower \Nhave been prepared.
2162,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You have chosen the path \Nof majority rule.
2163,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Cooperation will be key if you wish to clear this \Nphase of the exam.
2164,Decision x By x Majority?,8,One person's selfish behavior \Ncan derail an entire group.
2165,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And you can't start until you \Nhave five members.
2166,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Best of luck, gentlemen!"
2167,Decision x By x Majority?,8,We can't move on until \Nsomeone else arrives?
2168,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What do we do?
2169,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"We have to wait, I guess..."
2170,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Did you need something, warden?"
2171,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The test begins now.
2172,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Take your assigned positions.
2173,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Okay.
2174,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Oh, come on!"
2175,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It's been two hours...
2176,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What if the others all took \Ndifferent routes?
2177,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Only a fool would still be at \Nthe top of the tower!
2178,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Calm down, Leorio."
2179,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Complaining won't help.
2180,Decision x By x Majority?,8,But...
2181,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What if no one shows up before \Nwe reach our time limit?
2182,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Hey!
2183,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I can't just sit here and...
2184,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Quiet!
2185,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?
2186,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That sound...
2187,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Good grief...
2188,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Tonpa-san.
2189,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Oh.
2190,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It's the old man.
2191,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Okay!
2192,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I see.
2193,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So the door appears once five people arrive and \Nput on the stopwatches.
2194,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"""At this door, select \NO to open, X not to open."""
2195,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Forcing us to use majority rule already?
2196,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The answer should be obvious...
2197,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What?
2198,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Who pushed the X button?
2199,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Sorry, that was me."
2200,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I pressed the wrong button \Nby mistake.
2201,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Stop screwing around, old man!"
2202,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Are you blind?
2203,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Like I said, it was an accident."
2204,Decision x By x Majority?,8,How can you accidentally press \Nthe wrong button?!
2205,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It doesn't matter.
2206,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The door opened.
2207,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"No, it does matter!"
2208,Decision x By x Majority?,8,This guy deliberately pressed \Nthe wrong button...
2209,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Let's go.
2210,Decision x By x Majority?,8,We don't have time to bicker.
2211,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That's right...
2212,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Even if he keeps pressing \Nthe wrong one, the rest of us just need to \Npress the right one."
2213,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Fine.
2214,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Okay, let's go!"
2215,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Damn...
2216,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Seriously...
2217,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Another question so soon?
2218,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"""Which way do you want to go?"
2219,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"O for right. X for left."""
2220,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Right...
2221,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Or left...
2222,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?!
2223,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wh-Why would you choose to go right?
2224,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Normally, you should go left..."
2225,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That is true.
2226,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Studies have indicated that people \Nwho are lost or stuck at forks unconsciously tend to go left.
2227,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"I've heard that before, too."
2228,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wait! The numbers don't add up!
2229,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Which button did you press?
2230,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Right.
2231,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Right.
2232,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Y-You guys...
2233,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That's why they chose to go right...
2234,Decision x By x Majority?,8,To outfox the examiner.
2235,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"If the examiner knows that \Npeople tend to go left, the left path will be more difficult."
2236,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So we're just simple-minded!
2237,Decision x By x Majority?,8,We?
2238,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wh-What is this place?
2239,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Look over there.
2240,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The applicants have arrived.
2241,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Remove the shackles.
2242,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Jeez...
2243,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I'm finally free.
2244,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Hunter Vocabulary
2245,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Tonpa
2246,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Allow me to explain, gentlemen."
2247,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Before you are some of \NTrick Tower's prisoners.
2248,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Prisoners?
2249,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The Hunter Exam Committee has also officially hired them \Nas examiners.
2250,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You will be fighting against \Nthe five of them.
2251,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The fights will be one-on-one.
2252,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Each person may only fight once.
2253,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You are free to use any method you like.
2254,Decision x By x Majority?,8,There will be no draws.
2255,Decision x By x Majority?,8,A win is declared when the \Nopponent admits defeat.
2256,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You may pick your order.
2257,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It's majority rule.
2258,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"So secure three wins, and you may pass."
2259,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The rules are simple.
2260,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Tsk...
2261,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Majority rule again?
2262,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Well, I prefer straightforward rules."
2263,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"However, the actual fights will \Nnot be quite so simple."
2264,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"The prisoners' sentences will be reduced by one year, for every hour they \Ndelay the applicants here."
2265,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"In other words, their goal \Nis also to buy time."
2266,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I understand...
2267,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And we must reach the goal \Nwithin seventy-two hours.
2268,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So time will be critical during these fights.
2269,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Okay, I'm up first."
2270,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Bendot \N199-year sentence, robbery and murder"
2271,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Choose your combatant!
2272,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What should we do?
2273,Decision x By x Majority?,8,He said that we can fight \Nwith any method.
2274,Decision x By x Majority?,8,So that means anything goes.
2275,Decision x By x Majority?,8,We don't know what they'll try to pull...
2276,Decision x By x Majority?,8,There's too much at stake without knowing what they have up their sleeves.
2277,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Given that, I shall..."
2278,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"No, I'll go!"
2279,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Tonpa-san?
2280,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"I'll act as a guinea pig, so we can discover what they're up to."
2281,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Consider this an apology for before.
2282,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Hey, are you serious?"
2283,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Sure.
2284,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Plus, you guys don't actually \Ntrust me, right?"
2285,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Do you really want me to be the tiebreaker, \Nwhen the score is 2-2?"
2286,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You have a point...
2287,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Then it's settled.
2288,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Tonpa, you're..."
2289,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Th-That was a surprise...
2290,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I didn't expect Tonpa to volunteer.
2291,Decision x By x Majority?,8,He called himself a guinea pig.
2292,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Will Tonpa-san be okay?
2293,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Now, let us determine the \Nmethod of combat."
2294,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I propose a death match.
2295,Decision x By x Majority?,8,A death match?
2296,Decision x By x Majority?,8,They fight until one dies?
2297,Decision x By x Majority?,8,No...
2298,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Don't let him provoke you!
2299,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Well?
2300,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Very well...
2301,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I accept!
2302,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?
2303,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Seriously?
2304,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I commend you for your courage!
2305,Decision x By x Majority?,8,T-Tonpa...
2306,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Let the fight begin!
2307,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I...
2308,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I give!
2309,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?
2310,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What?
2311,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Did he just give up?
2312,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"M-Maybe he meant ""Give me a sec""?"
2313,Decision x By x Majority?,8,What did you just say?
2314,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"You win if I admit defeat, right?"
2315,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I give up...
2316,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I lose!
2317,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wha... Wha... Wha...
2318,Decision x By x Majority?,8,All right...
2319,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I win this round.
2320,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"If we win two more rounds, you lose."
2321,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You won't be able to advance or turn back.
2322,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You'll be stuck here until the \Nseventy-two hours are up.
2323,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Should that come to pass, our sentences will be reduced \Nby seventy-two years."
2324,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Man, that was a disgrace."
2325,Decision x By x Majority?,8,He looked a lot stronger up close...
2326,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Bastard...
2327,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You just confirmed all my suspicions!
2328,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"You're a worthless piece of trash, who's only good for sabotaging \Nother applicants!"
2329,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Exactly.
2330,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That's what I do every year.
2331,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And I plan to continue the tradition.
2332,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Wh-What?
2333,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.
2334,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I'm only in it for the thrills.
2335,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The thrills?
2336,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Yes.
2337,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The Hunter Exam is a trial meant to crush confident young people's dreams.
2338,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"The moment of despair, \Nwhen ambition and hope give way, gives me a sense of exquisite pleasure."
2339,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Especially when I'm actively \Nshattering these rookies' dreams.
2340,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I don't plan on becoming a Hunter.
2341,Decision x By x Majority?,8,I've already had enough fun this year.
2342,Decision x By x Majority?,8,It's time for me to bow out.
2343,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You bastard...
2344,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Stop, Leorio!"
2345,Decision x By x Majority?,8,But...
2346,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"They want us to waste our time, \Nfighting amongst ourselves."
2347,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"However, if their goal is to buy time, then the old man made \Nthe correct choice."
2348,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Huh?
2349,Decision x By x Majority?,8,That bald guy is probably a former soldier or mercenary.
2350,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Had you fought him, he would have started by \Ncrushing your throat, so you couldn't have given up."
2351,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Then he would have tortured you, \Nwithout killing you, for the rest of the remaining time..."
2352,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Th-That was one of the possibilities \NI took into consideration...
2353,Decision x By x Majority?,8,You look sick.
2354,Decision x By x Majority?,8,My plan was disrupted.
2355,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"I was going to take my time, \Npunishing him..."
2356,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
2357,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Sedokan \N149-year sentence, serial bombings"
2358,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"If we defeat two of the remaining four, then we win."
2359,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Regardless, we need to win \Nthree rounds and advance."
2360,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Who's going next?
2361,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Me! I'll go!
2362,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Are you sure?
2363,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Uh-huh!
2364,Decision x By x Majority?,8,The next opponent doesn't \Nlook too strong.
2365,Decision x By x Majority?,8,But you can't let your guard down.
2366,Decision x By x Majority?,8,He's still a criminal.
2367,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Uh-huh, I know."
2368,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Tonpa's actions have placed Gon and his friends \Nat a disadvantage.
2369,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"What is their next opponent,"
2370,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"Sedokan, planning to do in this match?"
2371,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"At the start of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase, there were 40 applicants."
2372,Decision x By x Majority?,8,"With 1 eliminated, only 39 remain."
2373,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Next time: Beware x Of x Prisoners.
2374,Decision x By x Majority?,8,And watch your back!
2375,Decision x By x Majority?,8,Be careful when you're out late.
2376,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
2377,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
2378,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
2379,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
2380,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
2381,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,They are known...
2382,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,...as Hunters!
2383,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I...
2384,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I give!
2385,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2386,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What?
2387,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Bastard...
2388,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You just confirmed all my suspicions!
2389,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"You're a worthless piece of trash, who's only good for sabotaging \Nother applicants!"
2390,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Exactly.
2391,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's what I do every year.
2392,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,And I plan to continue the tradition.
2393,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.
2394,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Beware x Of x Prisoners
2395,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"The Third Phase of the exam is \Ntaking place at Trick Tower, a prison for long-term prisoners."
2396,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Gon and his friends have chosen to partake in a five-on-five battle with \Nsome of the prisoners.
2397,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Due to Tonpa's actions, \Nthey've already suffered one loss."
2398,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,The next round will pit Gon against Sedokan.
2399,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What will happen in the upcoming battle?
2400,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Now, then..."
2401,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Sedokan \N149-year sentence, serial bombings"
2402,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"As you can see, I'm not very strong."
2403,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"I don't really enjoy fistfights or other physical activities, \Nsuch as running and jumping."
2404,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I do.
2405,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,But I'm not too good at using my head.
2406,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,As I thought.
2407,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,So I came up with a simple game \Nwe could both play.
2408,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,A game?
2409,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yes.
2410,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,It doesn't rely on either mental \Nor physical activity.
2411,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What kind of game?
2412,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We each light a candle at the same time.
2413,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,The one whose candle goes \Nout first is the loser.
2414,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What do you think?
2415,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yeah! That's easy to understand.
2416,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Let's go with that.
2417,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Okay. In that case...
2418,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,...decide which candle you want to use.
2419,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Press O for the long one, or X for the short one."
2420,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,This will be determined \Nby majority rule.
2421,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We have to choose one?
2422,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,This is a trap!
2423,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Normally, you'd choose the long one, so he must have done something \Nto the long one!"
2424,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That would be the safe assumption.
2425,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"But it might be a trick, and he's actually tampered \Nwith the short one."
2426,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,When you put it like that...
2427,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yes, there is no end..."
2428,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You've got a real dilemma there.
2429,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You keep your mouth shut!
2430,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yeah, yeah."
2431,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"When presented with a \Nclearly uneven choice, people become suspicious and \Nhesitate before deciding."
2432,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yes, this is a real dilemma."
2433,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"What's worse, if you make the wrong choice, \Nthe resulting mental anguish would be much greater than if the problem \Nhad offered two fair options."
2434,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Take your time.
2435,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"This may be a majority decision, \Nbut you're free to discuss it."
2436,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We have plenty of time.
2437,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hmm...
2438,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Hey, which one should I choose?"
2439,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Damn...
2440,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Which one should we take?
2441,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Gon, you decide!"
2442,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We'll abide by your decision.
2443,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Choose the one you think is best.
2444,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Are you sure about this?
2445,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,He never thinks anything through.
2446,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Instead of wasting time fretting \Nover what to do, let's rely on Gon's instincts."
2447,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Instincts, huh..."
2448,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I get to choose?
2449,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Okay!
2450,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Then I choose the long one!
2451,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You want the long candle?
2452,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Because a longer candle \Nwill burn a longer time!
2453,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Er, he's just taking it at face value?"
2454,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I knew he wouldn't think this through.
2455,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Well, that's that."
2456,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,It's not like we can figure out \Nwhich one is the trap.
2457,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Okay.
2458,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You get the long one.
2459,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'll take the short one.
2460,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Now, we light our candles together."
2461,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Normally, how long would it take that \Ncandle to burn down?"
2462,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Five to six hours?
2463,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Whoa... That was close.
2464,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,A strong wind is coming from below.
2465,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That means we should watch our step...
2466,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"No time to relax, huh..."
2467,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"If you don't pay attention, \Nyour candle will go out."
2468,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's because you're planning \Nto do something bad.
2469,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Otherwise, your candle would go out first."
2470,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I won't do anything.
2471,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,After all...
2472,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I've already taken steps.
2473,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,See?
2474,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hey! Look at Gon's candle!
2475,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,The flame suddenly became stronger!
2476,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"He must have hidden gunpowder or some other \Nhighly flammable substance inside, to make the candle burn faster!"
2477,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,H-Hot...
2478,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"At this rate, his candle will only last \Nanother two or three minutes."
2479,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Damn!
2480,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hey! That was dirty!
2481,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I knew you tampered with \Nthe long candle!
2482,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Heh, you're wrong."
2483,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I had four candles prepared.
2484,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,The dilemma you faced was mere camouflage for the actual trap.
2485,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You were given the impression that only \None candle had been interfered with.
2486,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"The choices were so uneven, \Nyou didn't consider the possibility that both had been."
2487,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,It didn't matter which candle you picked.
2488,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Either way, I would have handed you an oil-soaked candle."
2489,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"If the fire is stronger, then a little breeze won't extinguish it."
2490,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,He's fast!
2491,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I win!
2492,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yes!
2493,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Oh, he has a real spring to his step."
2494,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,And the ability to take advantage \Nof a bad situation.
2495,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm impressed by this boy.
2496,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yay! I won!
2497,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Good job, Gon!"
2498,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Now we have a win!
2499,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Once Kurapika and I win, \Nwe can advance!"
2500,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Hmph, you fool."
2501,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's the result of reliance on \Ntools and cheap tricks.
2502,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Tsk.
2503,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"If you want to fool someone, \Nyou have to sacrifice a bit."
2504,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Just watch.
2505,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,All right.
2506,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'll go next.
2507,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hunter Vocabulary
2508,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Lippo
2509,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm next!
2510,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Majitani \N108-year sentence, multiple crimes, including fraud and blackmail"
2511,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's one freaky body...
2512,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,And face...
2513,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Look here!
2514,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"I've killed nineteen people, but it bugs me that nineteen is \Nsuch an uneven number."
2515,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm so glad I've gotten to \Nmeet number twenty.
2516,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Now we have a serial killer?
2517,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I insist that we put our lives on the line.
2518,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I won't accept some half-assed contest.
2519,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Blood!
2520,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Entrails!
2521,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Agony!
2522,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Well?
2523,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You must be scared now...
2524,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Very well.
2525,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2526,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You can decide how we \Nsettle this contest.
2527,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'll agree to your choice.
2528,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,O-Oh...
2529,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You've got balls.
2530,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hmph...
2531,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I know you're quaking in your boots.
2532,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,How long can you maintain \Nthe tough guy act?
2533,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"In that case, I also propose a death match, where we fight until one of us surrenders or dies."
2534,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"However, don't expect me to stop when you surrender and \Nbeg for your life!"
2535,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Well?
2536,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Surely you're scared stiff now?
2537,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Very well. I accept.
2538,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2539,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Let us begin.
2540,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Is he an idiot?
2541,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Didn't he hear what I said?
2542,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We're fighting to the death!
2543,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Wait, he should have been scared \Nonce he saw me!"
2544,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hold on.
2545,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I forgot to mention something.
2546,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,No weapons allowed.
2547,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We'll beat each other to death \Nwith our fists.
2548,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"After all, while I may be hired as \Nan examiner, I'm still a prisoner."
2549,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm not allowed to carry weapons.
2550,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I see.
2551,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I understand.
2552,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Anything else?
2553,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"If not, I'd like to get started."
2554,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2555,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That little bastard...
2556,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,He had a concealed weapon!
2557,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That was close.
2558,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"However, it appears that \Nhe doesn't rely on it."
2559,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,He's that confident in his fighting ability?
2560,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"No, that doesn't seem to be the case."
2561,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Hmph, maybe he wants to run, but he can't in front of his friends."
2562,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Or he's so stupid, he can't even imagine how scary I am?"
2563,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yes! That must be it...
2564,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Well, in that case,"
2565,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I have a couple of cards up my sleeve \Nfor dealing with such fools.
2566,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Hey, now."
2567,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Is Kurapika gonna be okay?
2568,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,This guy looks dangerous.
2569,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,In what way does he look dangerous?
2570,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"As far as I can tell, this guy's just a blowhard who \Ndoesn't have the guts to hit anyone, let alone kill anyone."
2571,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You don't need to worry.
2572,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2573,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Why not?
2574,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Because when I look at him, \NI don't get chills."
2575,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What does that mean?
2576,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Time to show you the ace up my sleeve!
2577,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'll see you dead!
2578,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Here he comes!
2579,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Wow...
2580,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,He made a hole in the floor \Nwith his bare fist!
2581,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That was perfect...
2582,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,And I still have one more trick.
2583,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,A tattoo of a spider with twelve legs...
2584,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's...
2585,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yeah, I recognize it."
2586,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Anyone aspiring to become \Na Hunter has heard of it.
2587,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"That's the symbol worn by members of \Nthat notorious band of evil thieves, the Phantom Troupe!"
2588,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Really?
2589,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yeah, definitely."
2590,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,They're famous.
2591,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I heard about them \Nstraight from Kurapika.
2592,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Between the steel implanted in my body that gives my arms \Nthe strength to shatter rock, and the Phantom Troupe symbol..."
2593,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"After seeing both, no one would want to fight me!"
2594,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,What's wrong?
2595,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Cat got your tongue?
2596,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"I'm Majitani, one of the \NPhantom Troupe's four kings!"
2597,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Consider that first strike \Nmy way of saying hello.
2598,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,This is your last chance to surrender.
2599,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'm still willing to...
2600,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2601,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Wh-What's wrong with you?
2602,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Huh?
2603,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Wh-What?
2604,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,O-O-Okay...
2605,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Wait! I get it!
2606,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I surrender!
2607,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Consider this a warning...
2608,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"First, a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the \Nmember's number on the spider."
2609,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Second, they don't bother counting \Nhow many they've killed."
2610,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Third, never mention the Troupe again."
2611,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"If you do,"
2612,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I'll kill you.
2613,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Wow...
2614,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Kurapika...
2615,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Well, saw that coming \Nfrom a mile away."
2616,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Yup...
2617,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"You okay, Kurapika?"
2618,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Yeah, I'm not injured."
2619,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Also, is it safe for us to be near you?"
2620,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"From the moment I saw him, \NI knew he was weak."
2621,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"And mentally, I knew that \Ntattoo was a fake."
2622,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"But as soon as I saw that spider, everything in my sight turned red..."
2623,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Well, I can't really blame you."
2624,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Actually, to tell the truth..."
2625,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Hmm?
2626,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Even when I see a real spider, my personality changes, \Nand I enter a frenzy."
2627,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You should have told us sooner...
2628,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,But this means that the rage in me remains \Nas strong as ever.
2629,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I suppose I should be happy.
2630,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,We should keep Kurapika \Naway from spiders.
2631,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Definitely.
2632,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Damn you, Majitani..."
2633,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,You were completely worthless.
2634,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,His facial scars were from a botched \Nplastic surgery operation.
2635,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,That's one hell of a fraud.
2636,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Hey, you understand, right?"
2637,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"After two losses, our backs \Nare against the wall."
2638,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Let me handle it.
2639,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,I have a good idea.
2640,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Okay! I'll secure our victory!
2641,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Kurapika has defeated Majitani.
2642,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,"Another win, and they \Nwill clear this trial."
2643,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,How will Leorio handle the next challenge?
2644,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Next time: Trick x To The x Trick!
2645,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,The trick to the trick is to trick... \NI can't say it.
2646,Beware x Of x Prisoners.,9,Don't just give up.

2651,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
2652,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,They are known...
2653,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,...as Hunters!
2654,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Consider this a warning...
2655,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"First, a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the \Nmember's number on the spider."
2656,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Second, they don't bother counting \Nhow many they've killed."
2657,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Third, never mention the Troupe again."
2658,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If you do,"
2659,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll kill you.
2660,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Trick x To The x Trick
2661,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Leorio has volunteered for \Nthe fourth round.
2662,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If he wins, the group's victory is assured."
2663,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But can he win?
2664,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Okay!
2665,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll finish up the job.
2666,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Toss that guy out, and send in \Nyour next competitor!"
2667,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We can't do that.
2668,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What's that?
2669,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"We can't move him yet, because his match hasn't been settled."
2670,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The match hasn't been settled?
2671,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What do you mean?
2672,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He's still alive.
2673,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He was only knocked out.
2674,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Did you forget?
2675,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,This was a death match.
2676,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The fight doesn't end until one \Ncontestant surrenders or dies.
2677,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"He's still alive, and he \Nhasn't surrendered."
2678,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Tsk... Damned technicalities!
2679,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But she's right.
2680,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I agree.
2681,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I see...
2682,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hey, Kurapika!"
2683,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Go finish off that worthless trash.
2684,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I refuse.
2685,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Huh?
2686,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Why?!
2687,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The fight is over.
2688,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He'd already lost his will to fight when I punched him.
2689,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I will not fight someone who's lost.
2690,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Screw that!
2691,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Then what do we do?
2692,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,They're claiming that the \Nmatch hasn't ended!
2693,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Let him handle it.
2694,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Huh?!
2695,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Once he wakes up, \Nwe'll have our answer."
2696,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hey, now..."
2697,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We only have so much time left.
2698,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We can't afford to just sit and wait!
2699,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I have no intention of killing him!
2700,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Come on!
2701,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hey...
2702,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If you don't want to dirty \Nyour hands, I'll do it."
2703,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Killua?
2704,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"You haven't ever killed \Nanyone before, right?"
2705,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Are you scared?
2706,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I have never considered whether \Nmurder is frightening.
2707,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But this is a one-on-one battle.
2708,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You aren't permitted to interfere.
2709,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Okay, then..."
2710,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"But we're working as a team, so you shouldn't be too selfish."
2711,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Oh!
2712,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You do say useful things sometimes!
2713,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Keep it up!
2714,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Don't you understand that you're \Nscrewing up our chances?
2715,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind."
2716,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You stubborn fool...
2717,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Fine!
2718,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,A majority decision...
2719,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"O to kill him, and X to leave him alive."
2720,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Ready, and..."
2721,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Why isn't it working?!
2722,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Maybe it's because we're \Nasking the question?
2723,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Huh?
2724,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The watches only work for questions \Npresented by the examiners.
2725,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I see...
2726,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Okay!
2727,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Then we'll use a show of hands!
2728,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Those who agree that he \Nshould be finished off...
2729,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Now!
2730,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You traitor...
2731,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Weren't you just lecturing \NKurapika with me?
2732,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We're supposed to be a team... \NA team!
2733,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But it's pointless!
2734,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He's not gonna change his mind.
2735,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hey, Gon!"
2736,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Why do you oppose killing him?
2737,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Kurapika's right.
2738,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He was on the verge of surrendering.
2739,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Let's wait for him to wake up.
2740,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We don't know how long \Nthat will take.
2741,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I should just...
2742,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You shouldn't force others to do things.
2743,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Different people have different \Ncircumstances and ideals.
2744,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,No one asked your opinion.
2745,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hey...
2746,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,A majority ruling implies that you're \Nasking everyone's opinion.
2747,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Damn it! Fine!
2748,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Do whatever you want!
2749,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Leorio...
2750,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Man, what's wrong with these people?"
2751,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Now he's sulking.
2752,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,None of this matters if we can't even progress.
2753,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Don't you people get it?
2754,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Just leave him alone.
2755,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Fools...
2756,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,They've fallen for the trap \Nof the majority decision.
2757,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You would expect it to be easier \Nfor five people who've just met to make decisions by majority rule.
2758,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"While this method appears to \Nrevere each individual opinion, in actuality, it suppresses the minority."
2759,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"When a person consistently finds himself \Nin the minority, his opinion is always rejected."
2760,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"His alienation, anger, and discontent lead to antagonism."
2761,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Eventually, the team dissolves."
2762,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"After all, we're rivals in \Nthis Hunter Exam."
2763,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"None of us would just \Nstand by and watch, as our chances were hurt by someone else's dumb mistakes."
2764,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"But having been caught up in \Nthe spirit of this test, he's begun using majority decision \Nin unrelated situations."
2765,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,And he made the mistake of holding a discussion before the vote.
2766,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"He even used majority decision in its \Nworst form, a public show of hands."
2767,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Unlike when people press the buttons \Nof their own watches, everyone knows who diverged \Nfrom the majority."
2768,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,So the minority can't even \Nprotest the decision.
2769,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"When someone feels they have no say, and that their opinions are \Nconstantly rejected, the group breaks down."
2770,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"In this case, it means all five of us will fail the exam."
2771,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's just a matter of time.
2772,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The atmosphere on the \Nother side is gloomy.
2773,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I've been waiting for you...
2774,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,...Hisoka.
2775,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'm not an examiner this year.
2776,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'm here for revenge.
2777,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Since last year's exam, all I've focused on was killing you."
2778,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Today, I'll get payback for my scars!"
2779,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hmph.
2780,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Those scars merely show that you \Nwere an incompetent examiner.
2781,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You're blaming me for your \Nown inadequacies.
2782,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Keep yapping!
2783,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Prepare to die.
2784,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Dual wielding?
2785,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Infinite quad wielding!
2786,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Take this...
2787,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's not over yet!
2788,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Up, down, left, right."
2789,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Front and back...
2790,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You have nowhere to run!
2791,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"You'll be cut from every angle, \Nby my endless stream of blades."
2792,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Dodging my infinite attack waves \Nis impossible!
2793,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll have you writhe in pain...
2794,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"...until you die, Hisoka!"
2795,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It would indeed be difficult \Nto dodge your attacks.
2796,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Thus, I should simply stop the blades."
2797,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Impossible...
2798,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It took me over half a year \Nto master catching those blades!
2799,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Oh...
2800,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It was easier than anticipated.
2801,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I appreciate your futile efforts.
2802,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Damn it!
2803,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hunter Vocabulary
2804,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hisoka
2805,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first \Nto pass the Third Phase."
2806,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Total time, six hours and \Nseventeen minutes."
2807,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Tsk...
2808,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Is something wrong, Gon?"
2809,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Uh-huh.
2810,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I get it...
2811,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hey...
2812,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's quite possible that \Nhe's already dead.
2813,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What's that?
2814,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Well, it's been several hours, and he hasn't moved an inch."
2815,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Damn...
2816,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's too far away for us to tell.
2817,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Hey! We want to check his body!
2818,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What's that?
2819,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,He could already be dead.
2820,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"I already told you, \Nhe's only unconscious."
2821,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,How many hours has it been?
2822,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I can't just take your word for it!
2823,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Then let's make a bet.
2824,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,A bet?
2825,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,On what?
2826,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,On whether he's dead or alive.
2827,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What would we wager?
2828,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Time.
2829,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Time?
2830,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"We will settle our match through \Na betting game, a gamble."
2831,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"And we'll use time, rather than chips."
2832,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Look at the monitor on the wall.
2833,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We each have fifty hours.
2834,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"However, we can only wager \Nmultiples of ten."
2835,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We continue placing bets until one \Nof us has no hours left.
2836,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,A match where we gamble time...
2837,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We'll take turns deciding \Nwhat to bet on.
2838,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If you end up with zero hours, your time limit will also be \Nshortened by fifty hours."
2839,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,And if you end up with zero hours?
2840,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Our sentences will be \Nextended by fifty years.
2841,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If these terms are acceptable,"
2842,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll check whether he's still alive.
2843,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Leroute...
2844,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Serving a 112-year sentence for endangered species trafficking \Nand illegal gambling.
2845,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,This match sounds like \Nher kind of game.
2846,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Man, this chick is whack."
2847,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,She's willing to risk extending \Nher own sentence.
2848,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Consider your answer carefully, Leorio."
2849,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If you lose, we'll have \Nfifty fewer hours with which to escape the tower."
2850,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You shouldn't talk...
2851,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"After all, this is your fault, \Nfor not finishing him off!"
2852,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Fine!
2853,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I won't say another word!
2854,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hey, we shouldn't fight \Namongst ourselves!"
2855,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Keep fighting, keep fighting..."
2856,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Right!
2857,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I accept!
2858,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Okay! I chose our first bet, so you can decide how \Nmany hours we'll wager on whether he's alive or dead."
2859,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I bet ten hours that he's alive.
2860,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What's this?
2861,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You were the one whining \Nover his being dead.
2862,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Very well. Then let's check.
2863,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You're being pretty cautious...
2864,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Weren't you going to not \Nsay anything else?
2865,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Ten hours, huh?"
2866,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,This was the obvious choice.
2867,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Even if I'm wrong, as long as we confirm his death,"
2868,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Kurapika will have won his round.
2869,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If he's really unconscious,"
2870,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll just kick his ass.
2871,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,See? He's only unconscious.
2872,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,So it seems.
2873,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,All right...
2874,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Leorio has the lead!
2875,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,This is bad.
2876,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Huh?
2877,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's possible he isn't going to wake up.
2878,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What do you mean?
2879,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Remember when that woman walked near the guy on the floor?
2880,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What of it?
2881,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I thought then that he was already dead.
2882,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"But on second thought, they'd obviously prefer him alive, but remaining unconscious."
2883,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If he doesn't wake up \Nbefore the test ends, it shortens their sentences \Nby seventy-two years."
2884,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,So if he doesn't wake up...
2885,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,That's my point!
2886,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,That's been their intention all along.
2887,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Well, it's your turn."
2888,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Decide what we'll bet on.
2889,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Let's see...
2890,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,How about we bet on whether \Nhe's truly unconscious?
2891,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Huh?
2892,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I see.
2893,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Hey, what am I supposed to do?"
2894,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,The note didn't cover this.
2895,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"When I woke up, a note next to me told me to feign unconsciousness, and to hide the note in my mouth."
2896,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I understood the plan immediately.
2897,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If I can buy time by pretending \Nto be asleep, our sentences will be shortened \Nby seventy-two years!"
2898,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"So, then what do I do?"
2899,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Should I stay down?
2900,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Very well.
2901,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I bet twenty hours that he \Nreally is unconscious.
2902,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Okay, got it..."
2903,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'm supposed to keep acting \Nlike I'm unconscious!
2904,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But how do we confirm whether \Nhe's really unconscious?
2905,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Oh...
2906,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,That's simple.
2907,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,This guy's heavy...
2908,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll just toss him off the edge.
2909,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Wh-What the hell?!
2910,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If he's actually unconscious, he'll fall to his death."
2911,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Are you insane?
2912,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,His match hasn't been settled yet.
2913,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We can't accept those terms.
2914,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Don't worry.
2915,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"If he falls and dies, we'll forfeit the match, which will give you two wins."
2916,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Is that satisfactory?
2917,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Yes, it is."
2918,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What was that?
2919,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Don't be ridiculous...
2920,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,We're talking about my life here!
2921,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But then I'm changing my wager.
2922,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I bet forty hours that he \Nisn't unconscious.
2923,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Everything I have left.
2924,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Heh, little sneak."
2925,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Finally showing your true colors.
2926,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Then, I'll let go of him."
2927,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Whoa! Wait!
2928,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'm awake! I'm awake...
2929,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Don't let go!
2930,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Wait! Whoa...
2931,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'm gonna fall!
2932,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Good morning.
2933,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You people are crazy.
2934,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I've had enough!
2935,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I'll take the loss!
2936,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Forget the sentence reduction!
2937,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's safer in prison...
2938,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,You knew that he was awake.
2939,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,I actually aspire to become a doctor.
2940,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,All I had to do was check \Nhis eye movement.
2941,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"However, you're down \Nto twenty hours."
2942,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,But now we have a 2-1 lead.
2943,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Now...
2944,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,It's your turn!
2945,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What do you want to bet on?
2946,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"Majitani surrenders, giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead."
2947,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,"However, in the time-betting match, they're down 80-20."
2948,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,What will Leroute choose to bet on?
2949,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!
2950,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Bulldog... Bulldog...
2951,Trick x To The x Trick!,10,Bulldog scramble!
2952,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
2953,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
2954,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
2955,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
2956,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
2957,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,They are known...
2958,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,...as Hunters!
2959,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Then, I'll let go of him."
2960,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Whoa! Wait!
2961,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm awake! I'm awake...
2962,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Don't let me go!
2963,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"However, you're down to twenty hours."
2964,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,But now we have a 2-1 lead.
2965,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Now...
2966,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It's your turn!
2967,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What do you want to bet on?
2968,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Trouble x With The x Gamble
2969,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"In the five-on-five battle \Nwith the prisoners,"
2970,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Gon and his friends lead 2-1.
2971,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,They're one win away from victory.
2972,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"The fourth round is a series of wagers, \Nwith time as the stakes."
2973,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What will they bet on next?
2974,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, are you going to tell me \Nwhat the next bet will be?"
2975,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Or have you lost your nerve because \NI've figured out your scheme?
2976,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Very well.
2977,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Leroute \N112-year sentence, illegal gambling \Nand endangered species trafficking"
2978,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,H-Huh?
2979,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,She's really cute...
2980,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That old guy's probably \Ndancing on the inside.
2981,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I have a bad feeling about this.
2982,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Then let's bet on whether \NI'm a man or a woman.
2983,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
2984,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What's wrong?
2985,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Is there a problem?
2986,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,N-No.
2987,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,She's obviously a woman...
2988,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Or could she be a tranny?
2989,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"No, she's gotta be a woman."
2990,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"That's fine, but how will you prove if I'm wrong?"
2991,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Oh, right..."
2992,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'll let you examine every part of my body.
2993,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Until you're fully satisfied.
2994,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Seriously?
2995,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Her body?
2996,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio will bet she's a man.
2997,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Uh-huh.
2998,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh? Why?
2999,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Okay, I've decided."
3000,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I bet ten hours that you're a man!
3001,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I knew it.
3002,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Dirty old man...
3003,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh? But how did you know?
3004,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"This way, even if I'm wrong, \Nand it turns out she's female,"
3005,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'll still get to examine her body!
3006,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It's a win-win situation.
3007,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Actually, please be wrong..."
3008,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,There you have it.
3009,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I get it now.
3010,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Okay! Reveal the answer!
3011,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Too bad... I'm a woman.
3012,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,R-Really?
3013,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Would you like to check?
3014,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,B-B-But of course!
3015,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,A mistake I do not regret.
3016,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Just watching hurts...
3017,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He's gonna lose.
3018,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3019,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,The opponent has seen through \NLeorio's strategy.
3020,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"He's been betting conservatively, to minimize damage from either outcome."
3021,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,A gambler who focuses on avoiding \Na loss won't ever win.
3022,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I guess Leorio just doesn't \Nhave what it takes.
3023,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,As expected.
3024,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,His approach to gambling \Ndoesn't frighten me at all.
3025,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He'll never beat me that way.
3026,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Now it's your turn to think of a gamble.
3027,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What do you want to bet on?
3028,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,This is no time to celebrate.
3029,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I only have ten hours left...
3030,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio has no more room for error.
3031,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If he loses the next wager, \Nthe overall score will be 2-2."
3032,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,And we will have fifty fewer hours \Nto escape this tower.
3033,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio...
3034,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"I can't lose the next bet, but I can't think of anything \Nthat'd be a surefire win..."
3035,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Oh, that's it!"
3036,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We can bet on whether I'm \Na man or a woman.
3037,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"No, that wouldn't work..."
3038,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Hey, old man..."
3039,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You're thinking aloud.
3040,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I know.
3041,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio!
3042,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3043,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,How about whether or not \Nyou're still in your teens?
3044,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Come on, Gon!"
3045,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I don't look that old...
3046,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm clearly a teenager!
3047,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,T-Teenager?
3048,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,But he looks like an old man.
3049,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Right! In that case, we'll use \Nrock-paper-scissors!"
3050,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,A bet on who'll win a game \Nof rock-paper-scissors!
3051,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Sure.
3052,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Rock-paper-scissors?
3053,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Why did he have to pick \Nsuch a difficult wager?
3054,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3055,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Rock-paper-scissors is hard?
3056,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I happen to be quite confident in \Nmy rock-paper-scissors skill.
3057,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Just recently, I won a gourmet vacation \Nin a tournament in the shopping district."
3058,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Let's see, then."
3059,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'll put eighty hours on my victory.
3060,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,E-Eighty hours?
3061,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Is something wrong?
3062,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm free to bet as much as I want.
3063,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"W-Well, that's true."
3064,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"And if you lose, I can still only \Ntake ten from you."
3065,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Don't worry.
3066,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,She doesn't need to bet eighty.
3067,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Ten would suffice.
3068,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What if she loses?
3069,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Or is she that confident?
3070,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"As anticipated, he's starting to stress."
3071,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He's so easy to read.
3072,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"While rock-paper-scissors has simple rules, the game itself is quite complex."
3073,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If you consider the game \Nfrom a probability standpoint, there's only a one-third chance of losing."
3074,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"However, if your opponent can predict \Nyour reasoning and control your reactions, defeat becomes much more likely."
3075,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"In other words, simple-minded Leorio will be at a disadvantage."
3076,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I see.
3077,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,All right! I've made my decision.
3078,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What?
3079,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It's obvious what you'll use.
3080,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I can read minds.
3081,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Liar!
3082,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Your bluffing won't scare me!
3083,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You'll believe me soon enough.
3084,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"As planned, he's losing his \Ncool over a blatant lie."
3085,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,She can read minds?
3086,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,She's lying. She must be lying...
3087,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,But what if she's telling the truth?
3088,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio will use rock.
3089,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3090,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Let's do this!
3091,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Rock...
3092,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Paper...
3093,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Scissors!
3094,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You were right.
3095,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Good guess.
3096,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Nervous people unconsciously avoid any action that involves opening up.
3097,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"In other words, by making \NLeorio uncomfortable, she ensures that he's less likely to use paper."
3098,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"So if she sticks with rock, she's guaranteed a win or draw."
3099,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"As I was explaining, rock-paper-scissors \Nis actually a mind game."
3100,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Now I see.
3101,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Hold on.
3102,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Since we both used rock, wasn't that a draw?"
3103,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What of it?
3104,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,A-ha!
3105,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,So you were lying about being \Nable to read my mind!
3106,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If you really could, you'd have won."
3107,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Right?
3108,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What's so funny?
3109,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I deliberately gave you that tie.
3110,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Quit lying!
3111,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Did you forget?
3112,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We're trying to stall you here.
3113,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If I chose to, I could force an \Nindefinite series of draws..."
3114,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,But that wouldn't be any fun.
3115,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,So I'll end this with the next turn.
3116,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Well? What will you use next?
3117,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Think hard.
3118,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Come on.
3119,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Damn!
3120,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That's it.
3121,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Worry. Fret.
3122,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Worrying. Fretting.
3123,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"When someone loses confidence, \Nthey crave reassurance."
3124,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"That makes him more likely to \Neither use the same hand, or, in an effort to regain his confidence, to use a stronger one than \Nin the previous round."
3125,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Meaning that she wants Leorio to choose \Neither rock or paper.
3126,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Yes.
3127,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If she uses paper, she's certain not to lose."
3128,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Then Leorio just needs to stay a step ahead!
3129,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, if he could calm down, \Nthat might work."
3130,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Leorio!
3131,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What is it?
3132,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Hey, you'll win if you go with scissors next!"
3133,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What? Scissors?
3134,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Go ahead and try.
3135,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Then she'll just use rock.
3136,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"No, she'll go a step further \Nand choose paper."
3137,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Wait, then she'll take another \Nstep and use scissors..."
3138,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"No, no, then she'll take \Nanother step and use rock..."
3139,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Man, I have no idea what to think!"
3140,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Here we go!
3141,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Here... comes the... draw!
3142,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I win!
3143,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Rock-paper-scissors really is complicated.
3144,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Now the score is 2-2.
3145,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Worse yet, we have to give up \Nthe fifty hours he lost."
3146,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Sorry. I was pretty confident in my \Nrock-paper-scissors ability.
3147,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Pretty pathetic showing, then."
3148,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What was that?!
3149,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, I can't argue with you on this one."
3150,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Say, how much time do \Nthey have left now?"
3151,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes."
3152,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Which means they actually have fewer \Nthan ten hours left.
3153,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It doesn't matter how much time they have.
3154,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Because my opponent will die.
3155,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Hunter Vocabulary
3156,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Rock-Paper-Scissors
3157,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It's finally time for the last round.
3158,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Guess I'm off.
3159,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What? Killua?
3160,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What's that supposed to mean?
3161,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Damn it! I really needed \Nto win my round...
3162,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Gon... This guy is totally pissing me off!
3163,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Now, now."
3164,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Don't give up before we even know \Nwhat the contest is.
3165,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, if it's something like \Nmental math, I'm surrendering."
3166,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That's right!
3167,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Depending on the opponent, \Nwe still have a chance!"
3168,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That little kid is their last member.
3169,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Never thought I'd see him \Nfall prey to that monster.
3170,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Poor thing. He's still so young.
3171,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I didn't want to use him.
3172,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"However, the Hunter Exam has no mercy."
3173,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"If he dies here, that's fate."
3174,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm removing his handcuffs.
3175,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You guys are getting too scared...
3176,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Idiot, stop!"
3177,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Is he really that terrifying?
3178,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Isn't it all just ancient history?
3179,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That guy...
3180,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You know him?
3181,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We should take the loss.
3182,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Killua!
3183,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Don't fight him.
3184,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Why not?
3185,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Johness the Dissector.
3186,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Johness \N968-year sentence, mass murder"
3187,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,The worst mass murderer in Zaban's history.
3188,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He chose his victims randomly.
3189,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It was a famous case...
3190,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"146 people, young and old, men and women,\N met with brutal deaths by his hand."
3191,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,The victims had one thing in common.
3192,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He murdered all of them \Nwith his bare hands.
3193,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"He was known for his iron grip, the power in his fingers."
3194,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,It's been so long since \NI touched human flesh.
3195,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You don't have to face that psychotic killer...
3196,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,There's always next year.
3197,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Hey, Killua..."
3198,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Killua!
3199,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Damn it, was he even listening to me?!"
3200,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We should let him go.
3201,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,He could have a plan.
3202,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,How are we settling this contest?
3203,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Contest?
3204,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I believe you're confused.
3205,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,This will be a one-sided massacre.
3206,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I have no interest in the exam \Nor any offer of amnesty.
3207,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I just want to hear you scream.
3208,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Really? Okay.
3209,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Then the loser is the one who dies.
3210,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Yeah, that's right."
3211,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'll tear your body apart.
3212,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Wh-What?
3213,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm so cold.
3214,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That's... mine.
3215,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,G-Give it back.
3216,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Okay. That's three wins, two losses."
3217,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"We pass, right?"
3218,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Yeah, you win."
3219,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"By the way, you must be \Nitching for some action, since you didn't get to do anything."
3220,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Want to play with me?
3221,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'll abstain.
3222,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Oh, okay."
3223,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Who is he?
3224,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,That's right. You guys don't know.
3225,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh? Don't know what?
3226,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Killua comes from an elite family of assassins.
3227,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Eh? A-An elite family of assassins?
3228,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm back.
3229,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,What?
3230,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Uh... Well, good work!"
3231,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Across the bridge, you'll find a small room."
3232,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You must spend the fifty hours \Nyou gambled away there.
3233,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, let's go."
3234,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Yeah!
3235,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,R-Right...
3236,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Gittarackur, applicant #301, \Nis the second to pass."
3237,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Total time, twelve hours \Nand two minutes."
3238,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I figured you'd already \Ncrossed the finish line.
3239,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,All right!
3240,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Hanzo, applicant #294, is the third to pass."
3241,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I'm the first to finish!
3242,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3243,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Total time, twelve hours \Nand three minutes."
3244,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,No!
3245,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I don't believe this...
3246,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I came in third.
3247,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Good grief.
3248,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We have to spend fifty hours \Nin this room?
3249,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Killua.
3250,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Huh?
3251,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Can you tell me how that \Ntechnique works?
3252,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Technique?
3253,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,The one you used to instantly \Nremove his heart.
3254,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Oh, that wasn't even a technique."
3255,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I just ripped it out.
3256,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Ripped it out?
3257,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"But to make it easier,"
3258,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I manipulated my body a bit.
3259,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Y-Your nails...
3260,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Wow!
3261,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Mass murderers are still only amateurs.
3262,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,I used to be a professional.
3263,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,But my old man would've done better.
3264,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"When he removes a heart, you won't \Nsee even a drop of blood."
3265,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,How reassuring.
3266,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,As long as he's on our side...
3267,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Well, then."
3268,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,We have more than two whole days.
3269,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"What should we do, Killua?"
3270,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"First, we should search the room for any kind of entertainment."
3271,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Yeah!
3272,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Man, you kids don't have \Na care in the world."
3273,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"Gon's team of five has passed the trial, \Nwith three wins and two losses."
3274,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,"However, they must spend the fifty-hour \Npenalty in this small room."
3275,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,They're running out of time.
3276,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Next time: Last x Test Of x Resolve!
3277,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Think like a fish!
3278,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,You can do that?
3279,Trouble x With The x Gamble!,11,Yep!
3280,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
3281,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
3282,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
3283,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
3284,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
3285,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,They are known...
3286,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,...as Hunters!
3287,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'll tear your body apart.
3288,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Last x Test Of x Resolve
3289,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"During the exam's Third Phase, which requires applicants to \Nreach Trick Tower's base within seventy-two hours,"
3290,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Gon and his friends have incurred \Na penalty of fifty hours.
3291,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Meanwhile...
3292,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Gerreta, applicant #384, \Nis the fourth to pass."
3293,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Total time, twelve hours \Nand twenty-seven minutes."
3294,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Eh...
3295,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Not bad, I guess."
3296,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"If you hesitate on the first step, \Nyou'll hurt yourself."
3297,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Got it.
3298,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Hey, Kurapika."
3299,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Once we've spent fifty hours here, we'll have fewer than ten hours, right?"
3300,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Yes, that's correct."
3301,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That's way more than enough time!
3302,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You're a fool.
3303,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What's that?
3304,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Phase Three lasts seventy-two hours.
3305,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,And each phase is designed to weed out half of the remaining candidates.
3306,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"So, on average, it's meant to \Ntake seventy-two hours."
3307,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Just more proof that you're an idiot.
3308,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Well, our chances of reaching \Nthe goal within ten hours will depend on the remaining trials."
3309,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Yeah, that's true."
3310,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"But when we've got a guy \Nwho's so down on his luck, he can't even win a simple game \Nof rock-paper-scissors..."
3311,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What was that?!
3312,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"You deliberately lost a bet, \Njust to satiate your libido."
3313,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Then you chose rock-paper-scissors, \Na contest you couldn't win."
3314,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Shut up!
3315,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You surrendered without even a fight!
3316,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I...
3317,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I give!
3318,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Sure, I surrendered."
3319,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,But I only wasted a second of our time.
3320,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"You lost, squandering fifty of our remaining hours."
3321,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Take some responsibility, huh?"
3322,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Besides, what kind of Hunter is so bad at gambling?"
3323,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Shut up!
3324,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You don't even want to become a Hunter...
3325,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You only care about ruining our chances.
3326,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"And now, you'll have \Nthe guilt eating at you for the rest of this exam phase."
3327,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Hey! What are you doing?
3328,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Sorry about that.
3329,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Don't skateboard inside this tiny room!
3330,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Aww...
3331,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Can't sleep?
3332,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That's not it.
3333,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I can go two or three days without sleep.
3334,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Ten hours have passed, huh..."
3335,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"There aren't any windows, \Nso it's hard to tell."
3336,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,But it's probably morning.
3337,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Most likely.
3338,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Hey, pipe down."
3339,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Let me sleep some more...
3340,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That stinks!
3341,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What's wrong with you guys?
3342,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That wasn't funny.
3343,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Bastard, you'd better not \Nbe pretending to sleep."
3344,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Damn, now I'm totally awake..."
3345,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,And we still have forty hours left?
3346,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Oh, I thought you just had to stick bait on a hook, \Nand you could fish."
3347,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Yeah.
3348,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You have to think like a fish.
3349,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Think like a fish?
3350,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Yep!
3351,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,How would a fish feel if it saw \Nbait dangling in front of it?
3352,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Give me that.
3353,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Wow!
3354,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Let me try.
3355,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Like this?
3356,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You missed.
3357,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Just watch.
3358,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,H-Hey...
3359,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What are you doing?
3360,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Hey...
3361,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Just as planned!
3362,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Nice.
3363,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Hey, you'll tear my pants."
3364,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Stop it...
3365,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,See? I caught him.
3366,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Yep.
3367,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What's that supposed to mean?
3368,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'm a fish now?!
3369,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You don't have to get so mad.
3370,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,It's not like I'm gonna grill and eat you.
3371,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Don't mess with me, fool!"
3372,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Man, I can't even take a nap."
3373,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What are you smiling about?
3374,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Nothing, really."
3375,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You must be up to something again.
3376,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Of course not.
3377,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I just want to spend the rest of my time here peacefully.
3378,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Liar!
3379,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"I don't trust you, got it?"
3380,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The feeling's mutual.
3381,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Yes, the goal!"
3382,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Pokkle, applicant #53."
3383,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Goz, applicant #371."
3384,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Both arrived simultaneously.
3385,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Total time, thirty hours \Nand four minutes."
3386,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Damn.
3387,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Old timer...
3388,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"In a tie, the applicant with \Nthe lower number wins."
3389,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,These guys must be very skilled.
3390,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I would love to fight them eventually.
3391,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"You lost, squandering fifty of our remaining hours."
3392,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Take some responsibility, huh?"
3393,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Ow!
3394,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,One more hour...
3395,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Sommy, applicant #118, \Nis the thirteenth to pass."
3396,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Total time, sixty-one hours \Nand fifty-four minutes."
3397,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Man, still ten hours left?"
3398,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I finished too early.
3399,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Okay...
3400,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Ready to go!
3401,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,One more minute.
3402,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,This is one long minute.
3403,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Ah...
3404,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Wait up, Gon!"
3405,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Hunter Vocabulary
3406,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Bored
3407,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Thirty minutes of running, \Njust to end up where we started."
3408,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We should have taken those stairs down.
3409,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Shut up!
3410,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We all agreed on this route!
3411,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Man, I'm covered in dust."
3412,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,H-Hurry up.
3413,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We only have an hour left...
3414,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We're supposed to vote on \Nwhether to open the door?
3415,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"We need to move on. So obviously, \Nwe want to open the door."
3416,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I've had enough of your crap.
3417,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Wait, I pressed O."
3418,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Don't lie...
3419,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You specialize in ruining \Nother people's chances!
3420,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Sorry, Leorio."
3421,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Eh?
3422,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I accidentally pressed the wrong button.
3423,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What?
3424,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Oh, I see."
3425,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Wait.
3426,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Huh?
3427,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You owe me an apology.
3428,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I can't let that slide.
3429,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"It's your own fault, for doing things to make me distrust you."
3430,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I don't owe you anything.
3431,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You make it sound like I'm to blame for everything that's gone wrong.
3432,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What?
3433,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Have you forgotten who cost us those fifty hours?
3434,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You're the one who made \Na critical mistake.
3435,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Hey, Leorio..."
3436,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Shut up, Kurapika!"
3437,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Stop this, guys."
3438,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,It's my fault for pressing \Nthe wrong button.
3439,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Stupid.
3440,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'm moving on.
3441,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Wait, Killua!"
3442,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Hey, Gon..."
3443,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We're getting close to the goal.
3444,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What? Really?
3445,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Let's see...
3446,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"""This will be the last decision \Nmade by majority rule."
3447,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Are you ready?
3448,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Choose O or X."""
3449,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That's it.
3450,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Am I ready?
3451,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You bet.
3452,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Bastard...
3453,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Stop!
3454,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We don't have time to argue about this!
3455,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Please select a path.
3456,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,There are two choices.
3457,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"One path allows five to pass, but is long and difficult."
3458,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"The other path allows only three, but is short and easy."
3459,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Incidentally, the long and difficult path requires a minimum of forty-five hours."
3460,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The short and easy path leads to the goal in approximately three minutes.
3461,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Press O for the long and difficult path, and X for the short and easy path."
3462,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"If X is selected, two people must be secured to \Nthe wall with handcuffs, before the door will open."
3463,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The two chained members will be unable to move until \Nthe time limit expires.
3464,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The examiners were very prepared.
3465,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I think they have every weapon under the sun here.
3466,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Two out of five...
3467,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"So we're supposed to fight, \Nto decide the three who pass?"
3468,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Let me make this clear.
3469,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'm going to press X.
3470,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,But I have no intention of staying behind.
3471,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'll do whatever it takes to \Nbe one of the three...
3472,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You're shameless.
3473,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Had you not wasted fifty hours, we could have taken the long path."
3474,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Shouldn't you take responsibility \Nand stay behind?
3475,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What?!
3476,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'm sure everyone else agrees!
3477,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Have I said anything inaccurate?
3478,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Hold on.
3479,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I'm going to press O.
3480,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We made it all the way here together.
3481,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I want us all to pass together.
3482,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Gon...
3483,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Even if it's a big risk,"
3484,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I want to give it a shot!
3485,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Come on...
3486,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,You can't really call this a risk.
3487,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We have less than an hour.
3488,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Gon, there's only one choice if you want to pass this exam."
3489,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,There you have it.
3490,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Now we have to decide how to \Nchoose which three pass.
3491,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Well, I'm planning on two of them being you and me."
3492,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Heh, I've made it this far."
3493,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I won't fail now.
3494,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Whoever makes the first move wins.
3495,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Must we really fight amongst ourselves?
3496,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Tonpa, that was dirty!"
3497,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"In a fight, there's no such thing as dirty!"
3498,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Bastard!
3499,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Stop this, you two!"
3500,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Come on... Let's do it together.
3501,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Before we start fighting, we have to choose O or X!"
3502,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,It's too late for that!
3503,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Time to put you in your place!
3504,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Right back at you.
3505,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Seems our only choice is to fight.
3506,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,What should I do?
3507,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Three minutes remain.
3508,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,It's finally over...
3509,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Yeah, that took forever."
3510,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Made it in time...
3511,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,He's dead.
3512,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The fool.
3513,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Better to live and try again, than to pass and die."
3514,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,One minute remains.
3515,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Looks like it'll just be \Nthe nineteen here.
3516,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Kurapika, applicant #404, \Nis the twentieth to pass."
3517,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Killua, applicant #99, \Nis the twenty-first to pass."
3518,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Gon, applicant #405, \Nis the twenty-second to pass."
3519,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Total time, seventy-one hours \Nand fifty-nine minutes."
3520,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,My butt hurts...
3521,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,I didn't expect a slide for the short and easy path.
3522,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Three of them...
3523,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Thirty seconds remain.
3524,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That was really close.
3525,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,My hands are covered with blisters.
3526,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Same here.
3527,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Leorio, applicant #403, \Nis the twenty-third to pass."
3528,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Tonpa, applicant #16, \Nis the twenty-fourth to pass."
3529,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Total time, seventy-one hours \Nand fifty-nine minutes."
3530,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"My hands are blistered, but all five of us cleared \Nthe tower together."
3531,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,All thanks to Gon!
3532,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,We entered the long and difficult path.
3533,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Then cut a hole in the wall, to sneak into the short and easy path."
3534,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Man, I can't believe you actually came up with \Nthat idea on the spot."
3535,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"I realized that we could break \Nthe walls, using the weapons."
3536,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,But it took over fifty minutes.
3537,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"In an extreme situation, you were able to calmly evaluate our two options and circumvent them."
3538,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,That's what makes you special.
3539,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,The Third Phase of the exam is over.
3540,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Twenty-five applicants have passed.
3541,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,One has died.
3542,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Though the team members \Nhad their differences,"
3543,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Gon was able to bring them together, \Nto overcome the trial."
3544,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"However, a friend today may \Nbecome a foe tomorrow."
3545,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,"Gon doesn't know that before long, they'll be pitted against each other, \Nin brutal, individual battles."
3546,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Next time: Letter x From x Gon!
3547,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Now I'm worried.
3548,Last x Test Of x Resolve!,12,Because of me?
3549,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
3550,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
3551,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
3552,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
3553,Letter x From x Gon!,13,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
3554,Letter x From x Gon!,13,They are known...
3555,Letter x From x Gon!,13,...as Hunters!
3556,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Letter x From x Gon
3557,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"""Mito-san and Grandma, \Nhow are you doing?"
3558,Letter x From x Gon!,13,I'm doing fine.
3559,Letter x From x Gon!,13,I just passed the Hunter \NExam's Third Phase.
3560,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Isn't that great?
3561,Letter x From x Gon!,13,But it's been a tough ride.
3562,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"First, after leaving the island, the boat I was on ran into a big storm."
3563,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"But that's where I met \NLeorio and Kurapika."""
3564,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"You can't buy class with money, Leorio."
3565,Letter x From x Gon!,13,That's three times now.
3566,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Step outside.
3567,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"I'll end the filthy Kurta bloodline, \Nhere and now."
3568,Letter x From x Gon!,13,"Take that back, Leorio!"

3583,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Thank you very much!

3611,Letter x From x Gon!,13,Correct response?

3829,Hit x The x Target!,14,Two more...
3830,Hit x The x Target!,14,"The Fourth Phase will take place \Nover there, on Zevil Island."
3831,Hit x The x Target!,14,Let us proceed.
3832,Hit x The x Target!,14,I will need you to draw lots.
3833,Hit x The x Target!,14,Lots?
3834,Hit x The x Target!,14,For what?
3835,Hit x The x Target!,14,To determine who will hunt \Nand who will be hunted.
3836,Hit x The x Target!,14,In here are twenty-four numbered cards.
3837,Hit x The x Target!,14,"In other words, your ID numbers \Nare on the cards."
3838,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Now, I need you each to draw a card, in the order by which you \Nexited the tower."

3840,Hit x The x Target!,14,Guess I'm next.
3841,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'm next.
3842,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Hey, Killua."
3843,Hit x The x Target!,14,Huh?
3844,Hit x The x Target!,14,He said something about hunting \Nand being hunted.
3845,Hit x The x Target!,14,Does that mean we'll be \Nfighting each other?
3846,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Yeah, probably."
3847,Hit x The x Target!,14,"I don't know what this is all about, but I draw with style..."
3848,Hit x The x Target!,14,Everyone's taken a card?
3849,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Then, remove the seal from your card."
3850,Hit x The x Target!,14,The card indicates your target.
3851,Hit x The x Target!,14,This box has recorded which card each of you drew.
3852,Hit x The x Target!,14,This means that you're free to dispose of the cards if you wish.
3853,Hit x The x Target!,14,The objective is to steal your target's ID tag.
3854,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Oh, so we don't need to kill each other."
3855,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Naturally, you're free to use \Nany method you choose to steal the ID tags."
3856,Hit x The x Target!,14,Including killing your target and \Ntaking the tag off the corpse.
3857,Hit x The x Target!,14,That sounds like the fastest way.
3858,Hit x The x Target!,14,S-So that's what this is about?
3859,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Fool, there's nothing to be scared of."
3860,Hit x The x Target!,14,Listen carefully!
3861,Hit x The x Target!,14,Your target's ID tag is worth three points.
3862,Hit x The x Target!,14,Your own ID is also worth three points.
3863,Hit x The x Target!,14,All other ID tags are worth one point.
3864,Hit x The x Target!,14,You need six points to advance \Nto the Final Phase.
3865,Hit x The x Target!,14,"So while on Zevil Island, you must gather enough ID tags \Nto total six points."
3866,Hit x The x Target!,14,That is the condition for clearing \Nthe Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.
3867,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'd like to commend everyone on board for their excellent work during the \NHunter Exam's Third Phase!
3868,Hit x The x Target!,14,I will serve as your guide.
3869,Hit x The x Target!,14,My name is Khara!
3870,Hit x The x Target!,14,It will take two hours for \Nthis boat to reach Zevil Island.
3871,Hit x The x Target!,14,All twenty-four applicants remaining here are automatically qualified \Nto take next year's exam!
3872,Hit x The x Target!,14,"So if you fail this year, don't feel bad."
3873,Hit x The x Target!,14,Please try again next year...
3874,Hit x The x Target!,14,Th-This is so depressing.
3875,Hit x The x Target!,14,The battle has already begun.
3876,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Yeah, everyone's removed their ID tags, and hid them."

3885,Hit x The x Target!,14,Am I your target?
3886,Hit x The x Target!,14,I was speaking hypothetically.
3887,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Oh, right..."
3888,Hit x The x Target!,14,Don't worry.

3893,Hit x The x Target!,14,What number did you draw?
3894,Hit x The x Target!,14,How about you?
3895,Hit x The x Target!,14,Secret.
3896,Hit x The x Target!,14,Don't worry.
3897,Hit x The x Target!,14,You aren't my target.
3898,Hit x The x Target!,14,And my target isn't you.
3899,Hit x The x Target!,14,Show each other our numbers \Nat the same time?
3900,Hit x The x Target!,14,Okay!
3901,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Ready, and..."
3902,Hit x The x Target!,14,#44 is...
3903,Hit x The x Target!,14,Seriously?
3904,Hit x The x Target!,14,You have really bad luck...
3905,Hit x The x Target!,14,You think so?
3906,Hit x The x Target!,14,Who's #199?
3907,Hit x The x Target!,14,"You don't know, either?"
3908,Hit x The x Target!,14,Uh-uh.
3909,Hit x The x Target!,14,I didn't bother to memorize \Neveryone's numbers.
3910,Hit x The x Target!,14,"After the initial explanation,"
3911,Hit x The x Target!,14,"I started checking tags, but everyone had already removed them."
3912,Hit x The x Target!,14,That's so lame...
3913,Hit x The x Target!,14,Gon...
3914,Hit x The x Target!,14,Huh?
3915,Hit x The x Target!,14,What?
3916,Hit x The x Target!,14,Are you happy?
3917,Hit x The x Target!,14,Or scared?
3918,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Both, I guess..."
3919,Hit x The x Target!,14,"In a straight-up fight,"
3920,Hit x The x Target!,14,I wouldn't stand a chance.
3921,Hit x The x Target!,14,"But if I only need to steal his ID tag, then I have a real shot."
3922,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah.
3923,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Right now,"
3924,Hit x The x Target!,14,I might actually have a chance.
3925,Hit x The x Target!,14,That scares me a little...
3926,Hit x The x Target!,14,But I think it's worth it.
3927,Hit x The x Target!,14,I see.
3928,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Well, let's do our best."
3929,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Make sure you stay alive, Gon."
3930,Hit x The x Target!,14,Uh-huh!
3931,Hit x The x Target!,14,"You, too."
3932,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Thanks for your patience, everyone."
3933,Hit x The x Target!,14,We've finally arrived at Zevil Island!
3934,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Now, please disembark in the order by which you cleared the Third Phase."
3935,Hit x The x Target!,14,Tsk...
3936,Hit x The x Target!,14,This again.
3937,Hit x The x Target!,14,"After each person disembarks, we'll wait two minutes before \Nthe next person's turn."
3938,Hit x The x Target!,14,That means we'll be waiting \Nhere a while.
3939,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah.
3940,Hit x The x Target!,14,You will stay on this island \Nfor exactly one week.
3941,Hit x The x Target!,14,"During that time, you must amass your six points \Nof ID tags and return here."
3942,Hit x The x Target!,14,"All right then, the first person may start!"
3943,Hit x The x Target!,14,I understand...
3944,Hit x The x Target!,14,Those who disembark earlier \Nhold the advantage.
3945,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah.
3946,Hit x The x Target!,14,They can hide and monitor their target's movements.
3947,Hit x The x Target!,14,Two minutes have passed.
3948,Hit x The x Target!,14,The second person may start!
3949,Hit x The x Target!,14,The third person may start.
3950,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah!
3951,Hit x The x Target!,14,The seventh person...
3952,Hit x The x Target!,14,The eleventh person...
3953,Hit x The x Target!,14,The fifteenth person...
3954,Hit x The x Target!,14,The twentieth person may start.
3955,Hit x The x Target!,14,Two minutes have passed.
3956,Hit x The x Target!,14,The twenty-first person may start!
3957,Hit x The x Target!,14,See ya.
3958,Hit x The x Target!,14,Uh-huh.
3959,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Well, guess I'll begin by scouting the island."
3960,Hit x The x Target!,14,Two minutes have passed.
3961,Hit x The x Target!,14,The twenty-second person may start.
3962,Hit x The x Target!,14,Okay!
3963,Hit x The x Target!,14,See you...
3964,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah!
3965,Hit x The x Target!,14,"First, I need to find Hisoka!"
3966,Hit x The x Target!,14,Hunter Vocabulary
3967,Hit x The x Target!,14,Zevil Island
3968,Hit x The x Target!,14,How do I steal Hisoka's ID tag?
3969,Hit x The x Target!,14,Such a good boy.
3970,Hit x The x Target!,14,Very nice.
3971,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'm getting excited now...
3972,Hit x The x Target!,14,I won't be able to steal his tag \Nwith a head-on attack...
3973,Hit x The x Target!,14,It's another applicant.
3974,Hit x The x Target!,14,And another one is behind him.
3975,Hit x The x Target!,14,He's targeting the guy in front.
3976,Hit x The x Target!,14,He blew it!
3977,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Hey, that was close."
3978,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Sorry, but it won't be that easy..."
3979,Hit x The x Target!,14,That easy...
3980,Hit x The x Target!,14,Wh-What?
3981,Hit x The x Target!,14,B-Bastard...
3982,Hit x The x Target!,14,The arrow was coated with \Na fast acting tranquilizer.
3983,Hit x The x Target!,14,You won't be able to walk \Nfor the next week.
3984,Hit x The x Target!,14,Don't worry.
3985,Hit x The x Target!,14,There's water nearby.
3986,Hit x The x Target!,14,You won't die.
3987,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'll be taking this.
3988,Hit x The x Target!,14,See ya.
3989,Hit x The x Target!,14,Wow.
3990,Hit x The x Target!,14,He was able to mask his own presence as he stalked his prey.
3991,Hit x The x Target!,14,"And his target was able to \Nsense the shot being fired, and quickly dodge it, avoiding serious injury."
3992,Hit x The x Target!,14,"However, the other applicant anticipated this, and poisoned his arrow..."
3993,Hit x The x Target!,14,This is how you hunt!
3994,Hit x The x Target!,14,"If I have any chance at \Nstealing Hisoka's ID tag, this is it!"
3995,Hit x The x Target!,14,"First, I have to sneak up on him without being noticed."
3996,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Then I wait for my chance, and steal his tag!"
3997,Hit x The x Target!,14,Yeah!
3998,Hit x The x Target!,14,"But unlike this target, \NHisoka will be moving..."
3999,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Regardless, I'll only get one shot."
4000,Hit x The x Target!,14,I have to hook Hisoka's tag when he isn't paying attention.
4001,Hit x The x Target!,14,Okay...
4002,Hit x The x Target!,14,Read his movements...
4003,Hit x The x Target!,14,Now!
4004,Hit x The x Target!,14,Hmm...
4005,Hit x The x Target!,14,This isn't quite right...
4006,Hit x The x Target!,14,It's too easy to predict how a swinging target will move.
4007,Hit x The x Target!,14,That's right.
4008,Hit x The x Target!,14,I shouldn't forget that Hisoka will \Ntry to move out of the way.
4009,Hit x The x Target!,14,"If I can't get a bird by watching how it moves,"
4010,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'll never be able to steal Hisoka's ID!
4011,Hit x The x Target!,14,Huh?
4012,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Oh, well!"
4013,Hit x The x Target!,14,I won't catch a bird on the \Nfirst or second try.
4014,Hit x The x Target!,14,There!
4015,Hit x The x Target!,14,Whose number is this?
4016,Hit x The x Target!,14,The sun's about to set...
4017,Hit x The x Target!,14,I should probably stay in one place \Nuntil tomorrow morning.
4018,Hit x The x Target!,14,Damn...
4019,Hit x The x Target!,14,I didn't think it would be so hard.
4020,Hit x The x Target!,14,It's too dark for me to see anything.
4021,Hit x The x Target!,14,And all the birds are gone...
4022,Hit x The x Target!,14,Okay...
4023,Hit x The x Target!,14,I'll catch one tomorrow!
4024,Hit x The x Target!,14,Right!
4025,Hit x The x Target!,14,Back to training!
4026,Hit x The x Target!,14,It's no use.
4027,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Maybe it's not possible, after all."
4028,Hit x The x Target!,14,"To catch a bird, with accuracy, while it's in flight..."
4029,Hit x The x Target!,14,Birds can catch fish that are swimming.
4030,Hit x The x Target!,14,Go!
4031,Hit x The x Target!,14,I get it...
4032,Hit x The x Target!,14,There's a moment when I know exactly what \Nmy target will do next!
4033,Hit x The x Target!,14,Now!
4034,Hit x The x Target!,14,I did it!
4035,Hit x The x Target!,14,I figured it out!
4036,Hit x The x Target!,14,I have to aim for my target as \Nhe hunts his own prey!
4037,Hit x The x Target!,14,Heh.
4038,Hit x The x Target!,14,He actually mastered \Nthe art of hunting.
4039,Hit x The x Target!,14,Impressive little boy...
4040,Hit x The x Target!,14,But that intense concentration \Nwill be your undoing.
4041,Hit x The x Target!,14,Gon finally mastered the trick that \Nwould help him hunt Hisoka.
4042,Hit x The x Target!,14,"However, Gon was also being hunted."
4043,Hit x The x Target!,14,Next time: Explosion x Of x Deception!
4044,Hit x The x Target!,14,Explode!
4045,Hit x The x Target!,14,Explode...
4046,Hit x The x Target!,14,Ka-boom!
4047,Hit x The x Target!,14,"Oh, mushroom."
4048,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
4049,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
4050,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
4051,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
4052,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
4053,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,They are known...
4054,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,...as Hunters!
4055,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Now!
4056,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I did it!
4057,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I figured it out!
4058,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I have to aim for my target as \Nhe hunts his own prey!
4059,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Explosion x Of x Deception
4060,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Zevil Island, day two."
4061,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Gon has learned the technique which will enable him to \Ncapture his target.
4062,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Ow!
4063,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,My hands are all bloody...
4064,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I've been swinging my fishing \Nrod for two straight days.
4065,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,{\i1 catching birds as they swoop \Nafter their prey.
4066,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If I utilize this technique properly,"
4067,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'll be able to steal Hisoka's tag.
4068,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,All that's left is to find Hisoka!
4069,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Ow...
4070,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,But how am I supposed to find Hisoka?
4071,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"I guess I'll just have to walk around, \Nand trust my instincts."
4072,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What?
4073,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Why are they gathering around me?
4074,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,These butterflies...
4075,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,They're attracted to the scent of blood.
4076,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Hisoka, have you taken your target's tag?"
4077,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"No, not yet."
4078,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"You don't even know who \Nyour target is, do you?"
4079,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,No.
4080,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Want me to tell you?
4081,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"No, it doesn't matter."
4082,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'll just find three others to hunt.
4083,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"I remember that, back at the tower, \NHisoka was injured."
4084,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If this works, the butterflies \Nmight lead me to him."
4085,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Ah...
4086,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's the guy who was grazed \Nby the arrow.
4087,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Better luck next year!
4088,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,There he is!
4089,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Stay calm...
4090,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Stay calm!
4091,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I just need to wait.
4092,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,For Hisoka to make his move.
4093,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Man, where is everyone hiding?"
4094,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I haven't seen anyone for \Nthe past two days.
4095,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Who's there?
4096,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Oh, hold on!"
4097,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's just me...
4098,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Tonpa!
4099,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Don't tell me that your target is...
4100,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Hey, wait a second!"
4101,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Just calm down.
4102,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You aren't my target.
4103,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Prove it.
4104,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Right...
4105,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Here.
4106,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Good thing I didn't throw it away.
4107,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Fighting people who aren't my target is a waste of time and energy.
4108,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Don't tell me that I'm your target!
4109,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Unfortunately, you're not."
4110,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,#246.
4111,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Ponzu, huh?"
4112,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Huh?
4113,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You know who this is?
4114,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You didn't already know?
4115,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Uh, er, well..."
4116,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I wouldn't put it that way.
4117,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I just didn't have a chance \Nto find out...
4118,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Heh.
4119,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Want me to fill you in?
4120,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What?
4121,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Your target's appearance, weapons, special abilities, and weaknesses."
4122,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"However, I have one condition."
4123,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Huh?
4124,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I think I ate some bad fruit.
4125,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Bad fruit...
4126,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"To be honest, I can barely stand..."
4127,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"You want to become a doctor, right?"
4128,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Do you have any medicine on you?
4129,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I got it...
4130,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Don't soil yourself.
4131,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I have all kinds of anti-diarrheal \Nand stomach medicine.
4132,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Oh...
4133,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Thank you so much!
4134,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"First, tell me what you know."
4135,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,F-Fine...
4136,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Ponzu is a female applicant.
4137,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Female?
4138,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"As far as I know, five of the remaining \Ntwenty-four applicants use some sort of chemical weapon."
4139,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Ponzu is one of those.
4140,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,So she's the one.
4141,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,This girl happens to specialize in all kinds of drugs.
4142,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,But her strategy is simple...
4143,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hide and wait.
4144,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hide and wait?
4145,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,She sets a trap and waits for \Nher target to show up.
4146,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I see...
4147,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You shouldn't have to worry \Nabout anything else.
4148,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If you make it a close-quarters fight, \Nyou're guaranteed to win."
4149,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If you find her, watch your footing, and note which \Ndirection the wind is blowing."
4150,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Sh-She's fully aware that \Nsomeone else is targeting her.
4151,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Th-That's pretty much it.
4152,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,G-Give me the medicine...
4153,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Okay.
4154,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"To be safe, back up a bit."
4155,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,H-Hurry...
4156,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I-I can't hold it in!
4157,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Damn!
4158,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Your tag is mine.
4159,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I knew you were keeping your \Ntag in your suitcase.
4160,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Tonpa!
4161,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You two are working together?
4162,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Exactly so.
4163,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I didn't need your medicine.
4164,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I have my own.
4165,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,And I might as well confess that you actually are my target.
4166,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Wh-What about the card you \Njust showed me?
4167,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,That's my target.
4168,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,This is Tonpa's.
4169,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,We swapped cards.
4170,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,And you fell for our little trick...
4171,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,There you have it.
4172,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Damn you!
4173,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'll make you pay!
4174,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Uh-oh...
4175,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Tonpa!
4176,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,We'll meet at the usual place!
4177,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Gotcha!
4178,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hold up!
4179,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'm gonna kill you!
4180,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Hey, now..."
4181,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'm not the one with your tag!
4182,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Shut up!
4183,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Good grief...
4184,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"You still haven't learned \Nyour lesson, rookie?"
4185,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What was that?
4186,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's your own fault for letting us trick you!
4187,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Besides, working in teams during the \NHunter Exam is common sense!"
4188,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"I agree with the latter, \Nbut I cannot accept the former."
4189,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Huh?
4190,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"You shouldn't be tricking people, \Nin the first place!"
4191,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Kurapika...
4192,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Leorio, want to team up?"
4193,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hunter Vocabulary
4194,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Target
4195,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Please Do Not Feed!!
4196,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hey!
4197,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Return my tag!
4198,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If you want it back, catch me."
4199,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Okay!
4200,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I retrieved my tag.
4201,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"And we have the tags for \N#16 and #118, as well."
4202,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"So, Kurapika,"
4203,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Tonpa was your target?
4204,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You saved me back there.
4205,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You needn't thank me.
4206,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"I didn't want Tonpa to notice me, so I stayed hidden while you were jumped from behind."
4207,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What?
4208,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, that was because"
4209,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I figured there'd be no point in teaming up with you if you couldn't \Nwithstand that attack.
4210,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I suppose that you barely qualified.
4211,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You really are full of yourself...
4212,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well,"
4213,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I can't deny that it's easier \Nto work as a team.
4214,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Let's stick together for the \Nremaining four days.
4215,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Yes.
4216,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You got your target's tag.
4217,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"So with your own, that adds \Nup to six points."
4218,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Assuming he doesn't take it back.
4219,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,The #118 tag is only worth \None point for either of us.
4220,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,But it might still come in handy.
4221,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Next, we need to find your target,"
4222,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"#246, Ponzu."
4223,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Stay alert, in case we're being followed."
4224,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You shouldn't be talking.
4225,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Yeah, yeah."
4226,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You're absolutely right.
4227,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I know you've been following me \Nsince the exam began.
4228,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You fail at hiding.
4229,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Show yourself.
4230,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Let's play.
4231,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, come on out."
4232,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I know you're there.
4233,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,He noticed me?
4234,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If you won't come out, I'll come to you."
4235,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I guess that's it...
4236,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"In that case, it's all or nothing."
4237,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,When did he arrive?
4238,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I challenge you to a duel.
4239,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You'll die.
4240,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,This is my chance!
4241,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,My chance is about to come...
4242,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,In the moment Hisoka goes \Nto finish off his prey!
4243,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Why?
4244,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Why isn't Hisoka fighting back?
4245,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Hisoka, explain yourself..."
4246,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Why won't you attack me?
4247,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If I continue to avoid your attacks, you'll die eventually."
4248,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I can tell from the swarm of \NHemotropic Butterflies that your wounds are grave.
4249,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Someone else has already dealt \Nyou a fatal blow, yes?"
4250,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Though I do understand your \Ndesire to die in battle.
4251,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,If you...
4252,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"If you understand so well, why do you still refuse to fight me?!"
4253,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I have no interest in the dead.
4254,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What?
4255,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'm not yet...
4256,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You're already dead.
4257,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's in your eyes.
4258,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Bye-bye.
4259,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Sorry about that.
4260,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I carelessly let him escape.
4261,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Liar.
4262,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"He probably begged you to grant him one final wish, yes?"
4263,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, I felt sorry for the guy."
4264,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Given that he was dead either way.
4265,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You should cease pitying enemies \Nwho serve no purpose.
4266,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"You've done it before, haven't you?"
4267,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You've walked away from opponents \Nbefore finishing them.
4268,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I have standards.
4269,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'm not interested in people \Nwho have no purpose.
4270,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I only spare those whose deaths \Nwould go to waste.
4271,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,What about his tag?
4272,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Oh, I already took it."
4273,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"I have six points now, \Nso I don't need this one."
4274,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,You can have it.
4275,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Whose tag is this?
4276,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It belonged to some guy \Nwho tried to snipe me.
4277,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"He ticked me off, so I killed him."
4278,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, then..."
4279,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,This is always so fascinating to watch.
4280,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's pretty hard on me...
4281,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I feel much better.
4282,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, I'll just sleep here \Nuntil the final day."
4283,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Good luck.
4284,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,It's completely dark now.
4285,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Keep your guard up.
4286,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Night provides the perfect chance for \Nsomeone to attack their target.
4287,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I know that.
4288,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,"Well, I need two more points."
4289,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I suppose I should go hunt someone...
4290,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,I'll get him this time!
4291,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Found you...
4292,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.
4293,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.
4294,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Four days remain before the \Nexam's Fourth Phase ends.
4295,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Next time: Defeat x And x Disgrace!
4296,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,Let's shake hands!
4297,Explosion x Of x Deception!,15,With a firm grip.
4298,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
4299,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
4300,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
4301,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
4302,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
4303,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,They are known...
4304,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,...as Hunters!
4305,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Sorry about that.
4306,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I carelessly let him escape.
4307,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Liar.
4308,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"He probably begged you to grant him one final wish, yes?"
4309,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Well, I felt sorry for the guy."
4310,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Given that he was dead either way.
4311,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You should cease pitying enemies \Nwho serve no purpose.
4312,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I have standards.
4313,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'm not interested in people \Nwho have no purpose.
4314,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I only spare those whose deaths \Nwould go to waste.
4315,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Defeat x And x Disgrace
4316,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hisoka targets Kurapika and Leorio.
4317,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Gon targets Hisoka's ID tag.
4318,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"In the silence of the night, \Nsomething is surely about to happen..."
4319,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Now!
4320,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Oh, it's them..."
4321,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Amusing.
4322,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hisoka has found his prey.
4323,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Leorio! Kurapika!
4324,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I didn't expect him to go \Nafter Leorio and Kurapika.
4325,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,What should I do?
4326,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Don't stop!
4327,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Stick to the plan, and when Hisoka attacks his prey, go for the ID tag!"
4328,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,That's my only chance to take Hisoka's tag!
4329,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"No, I can't just ignore them."
4330,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"If they start fighting, I'll change plans."
4331,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"So I've figured out who my target is, but how am I supposed to find her \Non this huge island?"
4332,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Isn't walking around aimlessly \Na waste of energy?
4333,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Constantly whining would be \Nan even bigger waste of energy.
4334,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"You already have six points, \Nso you're finished."
4335,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But if I don't find my target...
4336,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hey.
4337,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hisoka!
4338,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Imagine meeting you here...
4339,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I keep running into people \NI don't want to encounter.
4340,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"You see,"
4341,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I need two more points.
4342,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Could you give me your tags?
4343,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,What was that?!
4344,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Screw that! I'm not gonna...
4345,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Leorio!
4346,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You said that you need \Ntwo additional points.
4347,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Which implies that we \Nare not your targets, correct?"
4348,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'm the one who's asking \Nthe questions here.
4349,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Will you give me your tags or not?
4350,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,That depends.
4351,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,We currently have four tags.
4352,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Mine, my target's, Leorio's, and a tag worth only a single point to us."
4353,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Of these, only two could be the number of your target."
4354,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Mine, or the tag only worth a single point."
4355,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Leorio's number is #403.
4356,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"He was the target of #16, Tonpa."
4357,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,And my target was #16.
4358,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Each person was assigned \Na different target, so #16 and #403 are out."
4359,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Indeed...
4360,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Neither of those is my target.
4361,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,So?
4362,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,That leaves the other two tags.
4363,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"If you're willing to take the tag worth \Nonly one point to us and leave, you can have it."
4364,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Huh?
4365,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But I will not let you have mine.
4366,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,And the same goes for the other two.
4367,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"If you insist on taking them by force, you'll have to fight me!"
4368,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Out of curiosity, what is your number?"
4369,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,#404.
4370,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Very well.
4371,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You have a deal.
4372,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'll only take the one tag.
4373,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'll leave it here.
4374,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Don't worry.
4375,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'll be standing here for a while.
4376,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"In only a few days, they've grown so much, \NI barely recognize them."
4377,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But they have much more to learn...
4378,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Why must unripe fruit be so tantalizing?
4379,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,A pity.
4380,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,This is the wrong tag...
4381,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Whew...
4382,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But now I only have one more chance.
4383,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,When Hisoka locates his next prey.
4384,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Wait!
4385,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,What if the next person Hisoka finds doesn't fight him either?
4386,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,That's right!
4387,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"If that person also hands over a tag,"
4388,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I won't get another chance!
4389,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'm so stupid!
4390,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I never even considered that!
4391,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'm scared...
4392,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,No more.
4393,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I don't want to be here!
4394,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I can sense his blood lust from here...
4395,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Uh-oh.
4396,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Those boys got me all tingly...
4397,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I must calm it.
4398,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Okay.
4399,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Time to go.
4400,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I can do this!
4401,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"His blood lust has calmed, but the look in his eyes \Ndoesn't even compare to before."
4402,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"I'm certain he'll attack the next person he sees, \Neven if that person surrenders."
4403,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I know!
4404,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I should move ahead and \Nlocate his next prey!
4405,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I also need to find a good spot \Nfrom which to steal his tag...
4406,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,There!
4407,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"At this rate, Hisoka will spot him \Nin the next minute."
4408,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I have to figure out where \Ntheir paths will cross...
4409,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Over there!
4410,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I've gotta hurry.
4411,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Hisoka will attack, as soon as he notices that guy."
4412,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,This is my chance to steal his tag...
4413,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,My last chance!
4414,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hunter Vocabulary
4415,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Chance
4416,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hisoka has completely \Nhidden his presence.
4417,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Oh, no! He's going to notice me!"
4418,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"I have to conceal my presence, too."
4419,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Completely conceal my... presence.
4420,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Here he comes!
4421,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Hisoka!
4422,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Damn... Bring it!
4423,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,He's going to fight back.
4424,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I did it...
4425,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I took Hisoka's tag!
4426,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Approximately, seven thousand."
4427,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Do you know what that \Nnumber represents?
4428,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,The number of chances \NI had to kill you.
4429,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,It's also the number of times you swung your fishing rod when you were training.
4430,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You were completely open \Nwhen you were swinging your rod.
4431,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But I admit that I admired your \Nconcentration and accuracy.
4432,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,That swing just now was \Nespecially impressive.
4433,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,But you didn't pay attention to \Nyour own surroundings.
4434,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Next time, remember to \Nwatch your own back."
4435,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,So long.
4436,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Damn it...
4437,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You surprise me.
4438,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"You hid your presence, \Nwhile waiting for your chance?"
4439,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Waiting for me to attack another?
4440,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Did you teach yourself how \Nto conceal your presence?
4441,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Marvelous...
4442,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Like a wild animal.
4443,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,And your timing was impeccable.
4444,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You concealed all traces of your attack by timing it with my own attack.
4445,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,A splendid job.
4446,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,His poison darts completely \Nrelax your muscles.
4447,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,The effects last ten days \Nin a normal person.
4448,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Only three days are left.
4449,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I'm sure you will have \Nrecovered by then.
4450,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Wait...
4451,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Didn't you come to take back your tag?
4452,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"No, I just came to commend you."
4453,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Turns out that he was my target.
4454,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,So I don't need that anymore.
4455,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"I don't need it, either."
4456,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Don't say that...
4457,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You owe me one now.
4458,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Feel free to pay me back when you want.
4459,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Goodbye.
4460,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I don't want to owe anyone...
4461,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,You can have it back now.
4462,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I refuse.
4463,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Right now, I'm letting you live."
4464,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"And I'll continue to keep you alive, until you've grown enough \Nto be worth killing..."
4465,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"I'll only take it back when you're able to punch me \Nin the face, just like that."
4466,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Until then, I shall leave the tag with you."
4467,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"Gon was completely helpless \Nagainst Hisoka, who knocked him out \Nwith a single blow."
4468,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,"What must he be thinking, \Nalone in the darkness?"
4469,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Next time: Trap x In The x Hole!
4470,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,The end... the end...
4471,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,I wanna be your friend!
4472,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,F-Friend?
4473,Defeat x And x Disgrace!,16,Y-You're so embarrassing...
4474,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
4475,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
4476,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
4477,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
4478,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
4479,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,They are known...

4481,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Right now, I'm letting you live."
4482,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Until you've grown enough \Nto be worth killing...
4483,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"I'll only take it back when you're able to punch me \Nin the face, just like that."
4484,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Until then, I shall leave the tag with you."
4485,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Trap x In The x Hole
4486,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Gon was humiliated, after Hisoka recovered the tags \Ntaken by Gerreta."
4487,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,As for Killua...
4488,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You're wasting your time.
4489,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'll never give you an opening to attack.
4490,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Tremble with fear.
4491,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Wear yourself out.
4492,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I am a very cautious man.
4493,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"I go to any lengths necessary, even when facing a child."
4494,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Once he exhausts himself, \Nand has no choice but to sleep,"
4495,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'll attack!
4496,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I am a very cautious man.
4497,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Man...
4498,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If you're not gonna show yourself, \NI'll come to you."
4499,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Huh?
4500,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What a pain...
4501,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You're only worth one point to me.
4502,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He wants to fight?
4503,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"I can't possibly lose, right?"
4504,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He's just a kid.
4505,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But...
4506,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Why is he so calm?
4507,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Is he really that strong?
4508,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Right... I am a very cautious man.
4509,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I should esca—
4510,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"I mean, I should back off."
4511,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But...
4512,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,My brothers will yell at me!
4513,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Actually, if I go back without \Ntaking his tag, they'll definitely yell at me!"
4514,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Bro!
4515,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We ran into some trouble.
4516,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"You're done, right?"
4517,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You idiot!
4518,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You can't even beat a little kid?
4519,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Y-You got it wrong, Amo!"
4520,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What do I have wrong?
4521,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I-I didn't want to hurt a little kid.
4522,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,So I figured I'd take it while he slept.
4523,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You're lying through your teeth!
4524,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,F-Fine!
4525,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If you insist, that leaves me no choice."
4526,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Time for a beat down.
4527,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If I start to lose, my brothers will come to my aid."
4528,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Hey, kid."
4529,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Just give me your tag.
4530,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Do as I say, and I won't hurt you."
4531,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Stupid.
4532,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Aw, don't say I didn't warn you."
4533,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Right in the gut.
4534,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Must hurt like a bitch.
4535,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Huh?
4536,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What?
4537,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Did you go easy on him?
4538,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"You're too nice, Imori."
4539,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Y-Yeah...
4540,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"#198, huh?"
4541,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What? No way...
4542,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Since it's only a number off \Nfrom the one I'm after, maybe #199 is one of your two buddies?"
4543,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Umori...
4544,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Yeah.
4545,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Get in formation.
4546,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Time to get serious.
4547,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,This is no ordinary kid.
4548,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It doesn't matter how strong he is.
4549,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He stands no chance \Nagainst our teamwork.
4550,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We three have defeated many tough opponents \Nwith this formation.
4551,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Just you wait...
4552,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We're gonna rip you to shreds.
4553,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,A-Above?
4554,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Don't move.
4555,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,My fingers are sharper than knives.
4556,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Huh?
4557,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You're #197?
4558,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'm so bad at guessing these things...
4559,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Hey.
4560,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Are you #199?
4561,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Yeah...
4562,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Hand it over.
4563,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Thanks.
4564,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Now, for the tags I don't need..."
4565,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,And the other one goes this way.
4566,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You still have three days.
4567,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Good luck finding them.
4568,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,See ya.
4569,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Damn it!
4570,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,#197 was always accompanied by #199...
4571,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I didn't expect that little kid to \Ndeal with them for me.
4572,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Good thing I was watching \Nfrom the shadows.
4573,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Made it easy to grab the tag I wanted...
4574,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,The kid noticed I was there...
4575,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I've failed...
4576,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Man, that was boring."
4577,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Wonder what Gon's doing.
4578,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Hunter Vocabulary
4579,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Too Bad
4580,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Six days have passed.
4581,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Only one day left...
4582,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's been four days since \Nwe ran into Hisoka.
4583,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,And we haven't seen anyone else.
4584,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Wanna head back to the starting point?
4585,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's possible that people have \Nalready finished.
4586,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"No, we won't find anyone there."
4587,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,This phase is unique because you have a chance to recover \Nyour tag if you lose it.
4588,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"On the other hand, you might have six points \Nin tags right now."
4589,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But that doesn't guarantee you'll have \Nthem when the phase ends.
4590,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You can't finish it early.
4591,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I see.
4592,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But it's worth a shot.
4593,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Only one day remains.
4594,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,People who already have six points will be inclined to wait near the goal.
4595,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I would do the same.
4596,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Okay, let's go."
4597,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Well? Anyone there?
4598,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,No...
4599,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,No one that can be easily spotted.
4600,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Damn...
4601,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Perhaps we should split up to search, after we decide on a time and \Nplace to reconvene."
4602,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It'll go faster with three people.
4603,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Gon!
4604,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I guess we all had the same idea.
4605,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"I've been watching from up above, \Nand a number of people are nearby."
4606,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Really?
4607,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I see... We should search from above.
4608,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,That won't work.
4609,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's only possible if you have eyes \Nas sharp as Gon's.
4610,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Gon.
4611,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Huh?
4612,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Do you have the tags you need?
4613,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Yeah, I guess..."
4614,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Damn, so I'm the only one \Nwithout enough points."
4615,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Who's your target?
4616,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"#246, a woman named Ponzu."
4617,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I heard that she uses chemical weapons.
4618,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Gon, did you see any women \Nwhen you were up there?"
4619,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Nope.
4620,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I see.
4621,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We can assume that there \Nare four possibilities.
4622,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"She's in good shape, \Nand she still has her tag."
4623,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"She's in good shape, \Nbut she's lost her tag."
4624,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"She's out of action, \Nbut she still has her tag."
4625,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"She's out of action, \Nand she doesn't have her tag."
4626,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Is it really likely that she'd still have her tag \Nif she's out of action?
4627,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If she were caught in a sudden accident, or if she were defeated after \Nhiding the tag."
4628,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If she died after concealing her tag, we won't be able to find it."
4629,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Sounding grimmer by the second.
4630,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Hey, do you know anything \Nelse about Ponzu?"
4631,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Does she wear a special perfume, like Leorio with his cologne?"
4632,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Oh, that's right."
4633,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Gon can follow her scent!
4634,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But she might not wear perfume.
4635,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He can smell the chemicals she uses.
4636,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"She's known for using drugs, right?"
4637,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Some of them must have strong scents.
4638,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Well, Gon?"
4639,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Okay, I'll give it a shot."
4640,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,That's why I'm here.
4641,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Is she in there, Gon?"
4642,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Yep, definitely."
4643,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What do you want to do?
4644,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'm going inside.
4645,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"You guys, wait here."
4646,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,There don't appear to be any traps.
4647,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'll head inside.
4648,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Don't enter until I give the okay.
4649,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Thirty minutes.
4650,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Huh?
4651,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If we don't hear anything from you \Nafter thirty minutes, we're coming in."
4652,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Yeah.
4653,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Unacceptable.
4654,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If that happens, you guys \Nshould return to the start."
4655,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I can't do that.
4656,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Since we've teamed up,"
4657,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I won't abandon you now.
4658,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Then I quit the team.
4659,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"It's selfish, considering all the \Nhelp you've given me, but I'll do this alone."
4660,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,No.
4661,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What did you say?!
4662,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"We're staying here, no matter \Nwhat you say."
4663,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Still got a problem?
4664,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Do whatever you want.
4665,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Hold onto that for me.
4666,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I have to go for it...
4667,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Isn't that...
4668,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Bourbon?
4669,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'm guessing that
4670,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I'm your target?
4671,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Ponzu!
4672,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,There's no point.
4673,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We gain nothing by fighting here.
4674,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I have everything to gain.
4675,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's just as you said...
4676,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You're my target!
4677,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Let's pretend that a miracle occurs, and you defeat me."
4678,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You still won't be able \Nto leave this cave.
4679,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What?
4680,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What do you mean?
4681,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He's taking too long.
4682,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Is Leorio okay?
4683,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Yeah.
4684,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's been nearly thirty minutes.
4685,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Kurapika! Gon!
4686,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Don't come in!
4687,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Leorio!
4688,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Leorio!
4689,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You fools...
4690,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Why did you enter the cave?
4691,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He has bites all over his body!
4692,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,If those snakes were venomous...
4693,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,They're vipers.
4694,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Their poison isn't that strong.
4695,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,But he's been bitten \Ntoo many times!
4696,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,S-Stop it!
4697,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,If you have any cavities or \Nopen wounds in your mouth...
4698,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,No problem!
4699,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Leorio, do you have any \Nserums in here?"
4700,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If I did,"
4701,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I could have saved you guys...
4702,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Leorio!
4703,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Anyway, we have to stop the bleeding."
4704,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Uh-huh!
4705,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,That should do it.
4706,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We need to take him to a doctor!
4707,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,I would stop if I were you.
4708,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,You cannot leave.
4709,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,What do you mean?
4710,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"When someone tries to exit this cave, snakes attack them."
4711,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Bourbon, the snake charmer, \Nset this trap."
4712,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"If you're bitten, you'll end up paralyzed like he is."
4713,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,And then you'll die.
4714,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Bourbon!
4715,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"You're looking for tags, right?"
4716,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,We'll give you every tag \Nin our possession.
4717,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,So let us out of here!
4718,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,It's no use.
4719,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,He's already dead.
4720,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,D-Dead?
4721,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Gon and his friends have \Nbeen caught in Bourbon the snake charmer's trap, \Nand can't leave the cave."
4722,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Will they pass the Hunter Exam?
4723,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Will Leorio survive the \Nvenomous snake bites?
4724,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,Next time: Big x Time x Interview!
4725,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Thank you, Kurapika."
4726,Trap x In The x Hole!,17,"Thank you, Gon."
4727,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
4728,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
4729,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
4730,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
4731,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
4732,Big x Time x Interview!,18,They are known...
4733,Big x Time x Interview!,18,...as Hunters!
4734,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio!
4735,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio!
4736,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Big x Time x Interview
4737,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon's group has been trapped by \Nthe vipers that block the exit.
4738,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"But the vipers' master, Bourbon, is already dead."
4739,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The one who set this trap is dead?
4740,Big x Time x Interview!,18,How?
4741,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I killed him.
4742,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I won't tell you how.
4743,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Gon, take Leorio."
4744,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Okay.
4745,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It's no use.
4746,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You won't be able to search his body.
4747,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The snakes are trained to attack the moment anyone tries to touch \Ntheir master or to leave the cave.
4748,Big x Time x Interview!,18,So you used poison to fight poison.
4749,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Judging from his wounds, you must have used Neurotoxic Bees."
4750,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He probably died from anaphylactic shock.
4751,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Anaphylactic shock?
4752,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"When a bee stings a human, the human produces antibodies \Nto counter the venom."
4753,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"But if that human is stung again \Nby the same kind of bee, they experience an allergic reaction."
4754,Big x Time x Interview!,18,An extreme allergic reaction is known as anaphylactic shock.
4755,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Depending on the circumstances, \Nit can be fatal."
4756,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You got me. \NThat's exactly what happened.
4757,Big x Time x Interview!,18,So you used bees to kill him?
4758,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Bourbon was my target.
4759,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"After confirming that he'd \Nentered the cave,"
4760,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I sprayed sleeping gas into the entrance, and waited until it was safe to enter."
4761,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Bourbon was sound asleep, but he'd already set his trap."
4762,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The sleeping gas didn't reach most of the snakes that were hiding in cracks at the back of the cave.
4763,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Well, I jumped back in time, so I wasn't bitten by snakes."
4764,Big x Time x Interview!,18,But that triggered my attack switch.
4765,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You keep bees up there?
4766,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If I scream or collapse, they'll attack any nearby humans."
4767,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I didn't expect him to die.
4768,Big x Time x Interview!,18,How could I have known that he'd \Nalready been stung once?
4769,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And I couldn't help him \Nbecause of the snakes.
4770,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Well, it was beyond my control anyway."
4771,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You can come back now.
4772,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"The problem is that he's dead, but the viper trap is still active."
4773,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And we can't ask him or \Nlook for a way to disarm it.
4774,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We're trapped with no escape.
4775,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio...
4776,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I've already given up.
4777,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We just have to wait for the \Nexaminers to come and save us.
4778,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The examiners?
4779,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You're saying that they'll \Nrescue us from this cave?
4780,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You didn't know?
4781,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Our ID tags contain a tracking device.
4782,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The examiners can locate each applicant.
4783,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If someone hasn't returned \Nby the deadline, the examiners will look for them."
4784,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Though this won't work if \Nyou lose your tag or if someone takes it from you.
4785,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Fortunately, there's only one day left."
4786,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The best course would be to give up \Nfor this year and wait for help.
4787,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We cannot do that.
4788,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio's condition is worsening.
4789,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We must take him to a \Ndoctor immediately.
4790,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The examiners won't move until \Nthe deadline passes.
4791,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If you don't have your tag, \Nyou'll basically be left for dead."
4792,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It's his own fault.
4793,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I warned him.
4794,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Kurapika! Gon!
4795,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Don't come in! The snakes...!
4796,Big x Time x Interview!,18,All you can do is pray that he \Nholds out until help arrives.
4797,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"No, there is still a way."
4798,Big x Time x Interview!,18,With a good chance for success.
4799,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"But if he isn't carrying any on his person, we'll have another victim."
4800,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Kurapika.
4801,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Look after Leorio.
4802,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon?
4803,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'm sure we'll find some!
4804,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon...
4805,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Hey, Gon!"
4806,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Wait, what are you doing?"
4807,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Didn't you hear what I just said?
4808,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hello?
4809,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon!
4810,Big x Time x Interview!,18,H-He's crazy...
4811,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Found it!
4812,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Kurapika!
4813,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon!
4814,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Use it on Leorio quick...
4815,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"All right, you're next."
4816,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Yeah...
4817,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I don't believe it...
4818,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"He jumped into a nest of \Npoisonous snakes to search for an antidote, \Nnot even knowing if he had it?"
4819,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The odds were in his favor.
4820,Big x Time x Interview!,18,What?
4821,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If you're going to poison someone, you'd need the antidote at hand, \Nas a bargaining chip."
4822,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"That's true, but..."
4823,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"That said, it took an incredible amount of courage to do what he just did."
4824,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio's condition is stabilizing.
4825,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He should be fine.
4826,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You must be really good friends.
4827,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Hey, do you have any sleeping gas left?"
4828,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I do...
4829,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Would you trade it for this?
4830,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Ah!
4831,Big x Time x Interview!,18,That's Bourbon's!
4832,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"This gives you six points, right?"
4833,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Yes, that's right."
4834,Big x Time x Interview!,18,But what are you going to do \Nwith the sleeping gas?
4835,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Put all the snakes to sleep, \Nso we can escape."
4836,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It'd be more effective than when \NI sprayed the gas from outside.
4837,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Within five minutes, the entire \Ncave will fill with gas, and the snakes will be asleep."
4838,Big x Time x Interview!,18,But it'll take five minutes!
4839,Big x Time x Interview!,18,No one can hold their breath that long.
4840,Big x Time x Interview!,18,There's no point if we put \Nourselves to sleep in the process.
4841,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Nine minutes and forty-four seconds.
4842,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Huh?
4843,Big x Time x Interview!,18,That's my record.
4844,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'll hold my breath and carry \Neveryone out of here.
4845,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I can't trust you.
4846,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You might escape by yourself.
4847,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"You really think he'd do that, \Nafter jumping into a nest of poisonous snakes to save Leorio?"
4848,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Trust me.
4849,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'll get you out of here!
4850,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It's ready.
4851,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"On my signal, release the gas."
4852,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Got it.
4853,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"199, 200,"
4854,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"201, 202, 203,"
4855,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"204, 205, 206, 207..."
4856,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Yes!
4857,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Well, I'll leave Bourbon's tag with you, so the examiners will find you."
4858,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If I give Leorio your tag, he'll have six points and pass."
4859,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Consider it the fee for carrying \Nyou out of there.
4860,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Sorry.
4861,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The Fourth Phase of the exam \Nhas just ended.
4862,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Will the applicants please return to the starting point at once?
4863,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You will be given one hour of extra time.
4864,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If you do not return during this time, \Nyou will fail the exam."
4865,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Furthermore, you are not allowed \Nto exchange tags after reaching the starting point."
4866,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Anyone caught swapping tags \Nwill be disqualified.
4867,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hunter Vocabulary
4868,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Ponzu
4869,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Then we will now check the \Ntags of everyone here!
4870,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#44 Hisoka-san.
4871,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#53, Pokkle-san."
4872,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#99, Killua-san."
4873,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#301, Gittarackur-san."
4874,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#191, Bodoro-san."
4875,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#294, Hanzo-san."
4876,Big x Time x Interview!,18,So six applicants have passed?
4877,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Oh?
4878,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon.
4879,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Ah, three more arrive at the last second."
4880,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Killua.
4881,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And now for the last few members...
4882,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#404, Kurapika-san."
4883,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#403, Leorio-san."
4884,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"And #405, Gon-san."
4885,Big x Time x Interview!,18,These nine applicants have passed the Fourth Phase of the exam!
4886,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Six of the nine are rookies?
4887,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Marvelous, marvelous."
4888,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Has this ever happened before?
4889,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Hmm, there's a trend where we'll go many years without \Na single rookie qualifying."
4890,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Then suddenly, we'll have a whole bunch \Nof promising newbies."
4891,Big x Time x Interview!,18,This is the fourth time I've seen it happen.
4892,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"By the way, what are we doing \Nfor the Final Phase?"
4893,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Oh, right."
4894,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You haven't told us yet.
4895,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Yes, about that..."
4896,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I intend to have them participate \Nin a rather peculiar fight.
4897,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hmm? A rather peculiar fight?
4898,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"First, I want to talk to each of the nine remaining applicants."
4899,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Pathetic...
4900,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I needed the two of you to do everything for me during \Nthe Fourth Phase.
4901,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I promise I'll return the favor.
4902,Big x Time x Interview!,18,So...
4903,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Thanks.
4904,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I have an announcement for all applicants.
4905,Big x Time x Interview!,18,The chairman wishes to interview \Nthe remaining candidates.
4906,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Interview?
4907,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"When your number is called, please come to the first reception room, \Non the second floor."
4908,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Then we will start with #44, Hisoka-sama."
4909,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Well, have a seat."
4910,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Don't tell me that this is \Nthe exam's Final Phase.
4911,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It may be related...
4912,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'll just be asking a few questions \Nto satisfy my curiosity.
4913,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"First, why do you want to \Nbecome a Hunter?"
4914,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I'm not particularly interested in \Nbecoming a Hunter, but..."
4915,Big x Time x Interview!,18,But?
4916,Big x Time x Interview!,18,A Hunter License can be very useful.
4917,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Oh, any examples?"
4918,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"For example,"
4919,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hunters usually can't be punished \Nwhen they kill someone.
4920,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I see.
4921,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Then I'll move on to the next question.
4922,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Which of the other eight applicants are you keeping an eye on?
4923,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#99.
4924,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Ah...
4925,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#405 is also on my radar, but it's #99 I'm keeping an eye on."
4926,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I would love to take him on one day.
4927,Big x Time x Interview!,18,One last question.
4928,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Which of the other eight applicants \Nwould you least want to fight?
4929,Big x Time x Interview!,18,That would be #405.
4930,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Though #99 is also up there.
4931,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If you're asking whom I least \Nwant to fight at this moment, my answer would be #405."
4932,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Ah, I understand."
4933,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I should mention that the one I most \Nwant to fight at this moment is you.
4934,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Yep, nice job."
4935,Big x Time x Interview!,18,You're excused.
4936,Big x Time x Interview!,18,That old man is too crafty...
4937,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"He left himself so undefended, \NI lost my edge."
4938,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'm watching out for #404.
4939,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He looks to be the most \Nbalanced applicant left.
4940,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I definitely don't want to fight #44.
4941,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"To be honest, I doubt I can beat him."
4942,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Has to be Gon. \NSince we're the same age.
4943,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I don't want to fight #53.
4944,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I don't think it'd be a \Nvery interesting fight.
4945,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I've got my eye on #44.
4946,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He has real presence.
4947,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#405 and #99 are still children.
4948,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I couldn't bring myself to fight them.
4949,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#99.
4950,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#44.
4951,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Who am I watching out for?
4952,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"#44, Hisoka."
4953,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"A lot's happened, so I've \Nbeen watching him."
4954,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I can't choose one out of \N#99, #403, and #404."
4955,Big x Time x Interview!,18,It has to be #44.
4956,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He's the most dangerous one here.
4957,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And #44 is the one I least want to fight.
4958,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I'm watching #405 for positive reasons, and #44 for negative reasons."
4959,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If I'm given ample reason, \NI'll fight anyone."
4960,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"If not, I would prefer not to fight anyone."
4961,Big x Time x Interview!,18,#405.
4962,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I owe him, and I hope that \Nhe passes the exam."
4963,Big x Time x Interview!,18,So I'm hoping I don't have to fight #405.
4964,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Hmm, the results were more lopsided \Nthan I was expecting."
4965,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon.
4966,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We've reached the Final Phase \Nof the exam.
4967,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Yeah.
4968,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Heart
4969,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Yes, that's good."
4970,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Sorry to keep you waiting.
4971,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I've drawn up the bracket.
4972,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Huh?
4973,Big x Time x Interview!,18,What is this?
4974,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Ch-Chairman?
4975,Big x Time x Interview!,18,What?
4976,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Are you serious about this?
4977,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Dead serious.
4978,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He certainly has a serious expression.
4979,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Th-That's a serious expression?
4980,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Winning will make them Hunters.
4981,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon...
4982,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hmm?
4983,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Did something happen during \Nthe Fourth Phase?
4984,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"When we met up, you were acting a little strange."
4985,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And you've been somewhat subdued since we left Zevil Island.
4986,Big x Time x Interview!,18,My target was Hisoka.
4987,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I waited for the perfect chance \Nand stole his tag, but someone else was tailing me, and he got me with a poisoned dart."
4988,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"Soon after, Hisoka took back his tag from the person who got me, \Nand he left it with me."
4989,Big x Time x Interview!,18,He said that I owed him now.
4990,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Hisoka said that?
4991,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I told him I didn't need his help, and he sent me flying."
4992,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I'll only take it back when you're able to punch me \Nin the face, just like that."
4993,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I was so mad that I couldn't do anything against him...
4994,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"After that, I was pretty \Nmiserable and lonely."
4995,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I felt so helpless,"
4996,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I wanted company...
4997,Big x Time x Interview!,18,"I wanted to help someone,"
4998,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I guess.
4999,Big x Time x Interview!,18,That's why I was looking for you two.
5000,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon.
5001,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Leorio and I have only been able to make it this far because of you.
5002,Big x Time x Interview!,18,We're truly grateful.
5003,Big x Time x Interview!,18,I'd also like to thank you.
5004,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Gon has deepened his bond \Nwith his friends.
5005,Big x Time x Interview!,18,And the nine remaining \Napplicants are about to begin the exam's Final Phase.
5006,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Next time: Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!
5007,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Then how am I supposed to win?
5008,Big x Time x Interview!,18,Just do it!
5009,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
5010,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
5011,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
5012,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
5013,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
5014,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,They are known...
5015,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,...as Hunters!
5016,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What?
5017,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Are you serious about this?
5018,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Dead serious.
5019,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Those who win will join \Nthe ranks of the Hunters.
5020,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose
5021,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Nine applicants:
5022,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Gon, Killua, Kurapika,"
5023,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Leorio, Pokkle, Bodoro,"
5024,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Gittarackur, Hanzo, and Hisoka, head to the Final Phase, having passed \Nthe exam's Fourth Phase."
5025,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Well, gentlemen."
5026,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Did you get plenty of rest?
5027,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This hotel is owned by the \NHunter Exam Selection Committee.
5028,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,The place is all yours until the \Nbattles have concluded.
5029,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"For the Final Phase, we will be \Nholding a one-on-one tournament."
5030,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So only the last person standing passes?
5031,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,No.
5032,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,One win is all you need to pass.
5033,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,One win?
5034,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Then, in this tournament..."
5035,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"The winners are removed from competition, while the losers continue up the bracket."
5036,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"In other words, the person who \Nfinishes at the top will not pass."
5037,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Does everyone understand now?
5038,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So you're saying that only \None person will fail.
5039,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Exactly.
5040,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,And here is the bracket.
5041,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Impressive, right?"
5042,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"After all, everyone has at least \Ntwo chances to win."
5043,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"But some people, like #294 and #405, get five chances."
5044,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Why didn't you use a balanced bracket?
5045,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,A question that must be on everyone's mind.
5046,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This bracket was assembled \Nbased on your performances throughout the entire exam.
5047,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Those who performed better \Nreceived more chances.
5048,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That doesn't sound right.
5049,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Can you explain how you \Nscored our performances?
5050,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,No!
5051,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Why not?
5052,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Your scores are classified information.
5053,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So I can't tell you everything.
5054,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But I can explain our methods.
5055,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"First, we consider three major criteria: physical strength, mental strength, and overall impression."
5056,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"For physical strength, we use \Nan aggregate of agility, flexibility, endurance, and perception."
5057,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"For mental strength, we use \Nan aggregate of resilience, adaptability, judgment, and creativity."
5058,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"However, this information is only \Nused as a reference point."
5059,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"After all, you were strong enough to advance to the Final Phase."
5060,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"However, we are most concerned \Nwith your overall impression."
5061,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This refers to any intangible factors not previously mentioned.
5062,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You could consider this an evaluation of your potential as a Hunter.
5063,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,And we also incorporate the \Nopinions of your peers.
5064,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That was our process.
5065,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Based on performance, \NI should be ranked higher..."
5066,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Do I have less potential than Gon?
5067,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,The battle rules are quite simple.
5068,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Weapons are allowed.
5069,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,No cheating.
5070,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If your opponent admits defeat, you win."
5071,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,However!
5072,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you kill your opponent, you will be immediately disqualified."
5073,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"All remaining applicants will pass, \Nand the exam will end."
5074,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Are we clear?
5075,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Then, we shall begin the exam's Final Phase."
5076,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,The first match is Hanzo versus Gon.
5077,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Please step forward.
5078,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I will serve as the referee.
5079,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,My name is Masta.
5080,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Best of luck.
5081,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Hey, good to see you again."
5082,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You were tailing me during the Fourth Phase.
5083,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You noticed?
5084,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Naturally...
5085,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm assuming that each applicant was \Nassigned an examiner for the Fourth Phase.
5086,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Well, I'm sure everyone else noticed."
5087,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I had no idea.
5088,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I obviously noticed.
5089,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I thought it wasn't worth mentioning.
5090,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Y-Yeah...
5091,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,How was I supposed to notice that?
5092,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You have my thanks.
5093,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,My rank was higher because your \Nreports on me were accurate.
5094,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Though the outcome was never in doubt!
5095,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Y-Yes...
5096,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Moving on,"
5097,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I have a question for you.
5098,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What is it?
5099,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"We only win if our opponent \Nsurrenders, correct?"
5100,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It doesn't count if we knock them unconscious.
5101,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"No TKOs allowed, either."
5102,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Yes, that is correct."
5103,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I see.
5104,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This one could be difficult...
5105,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"He looks tough, but we should be even in terms of strength and speed."
5106,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I can use my speed to keep on the \Nmove until I get an opening.
5107,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Now then, it's time to begin."
5108,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Get him, Gon!"
5109,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,How well can he do against Hanzo?
5110,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Begin!
5111,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Put some distance between us...
5112,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You must be confident in your legs.
5113,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You have my respect.
5114,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You did well for a kid.
5115,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Tsk.
5116,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I could have easily dodged that attack.
5117,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Well, this would already be over \Nif it were a normal fight..."
5118,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Here, wake up."
5119,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You must feel terrible.
5120,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I hit you hard enough to make \Nyour brain bounce around.
5121,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Do you understand? \NYou have no chance against me.
5122,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Might as well give up now...
5123,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,No way...
5124,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Think about it.
5125,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you surrender now, you'll still be in \Ndecent shape for your next fight."
5126,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,There's no reason to be stubborn.
5127,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Just surrender.
5128,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Never gonna happen!
5129,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Surrender.
5130,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Gon! Don't be silly!
5131,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You'll still have another chance!
5132,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You should...
5133,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Leorio!
5134,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you were in Gon's position, \Nwould you surrender?"
5135,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Hell, no!"
5136,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That guy thinks he's hot stuff...
5137,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Gon feels the same way!
5138,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I know! I know that...
5139,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But there isn't any other choice!
5140,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"You're contradicting yourself, but I understand how you feel!"
5141,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Yield this fight, Gon!"
5142,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's suicide!
5143,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Honestly, the chairman's nasty \Nstreak is in a class all its own."
5144,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What do you mean?
5145,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,The applicants who've made it this far are unlikely to simply surrender.
5146,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,True.
5147,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"This goes beyond a ""rather peculiar fight."""
5148,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This system is just plain crazy.
5149,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That kid's in danger.
5150,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Hunter Vocabulary
5151,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Hanzo
5152,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's been three hours.
5153,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,There's nothing left for him to vomit.
5154,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Get up.
5155,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Enough, already..."
5156,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm gonna kill you!
5157,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'll fight you in his place!
5158,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you can't take it, leave."
5159,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's only going to get worse.
5160,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What was that?!
5161,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,No one may interfere in a one-on-one match.
5162,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"And if you step in, Gon will be \Nthe one disqualified!"
5163,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's okay...
5164,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Leorio.
5165,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This is... nothing...
5166,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I-I can still fight...
5167,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm going to break your arm.
5168,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I'm not joking around, so give up."
5169,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Surrender.
5170,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Never!
5171,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,He really broke his arm.
5172,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,There you go.
5173,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You can't use your left arm anymore.
5174,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Kurapika, don't try to stop me."
5175,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,If that bastard does anything else to Gon...
5176,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Sorry, Gon, but I can't stop myself."
5177,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Me?
5178,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Stop you?
5179,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Don't worry.
5180,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,There is no chance of that happening.
5181,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I'm sure you're in too much pain to listen, but hear me out."
5182,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I am descended from the shinobi, \Na clan of covert agents."
5183,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"From the day I was born, I was forced to endure harsh training in order \Nto master the art of ninpo."
5184,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"For eighteen years,"
5185,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I have trained my body and \Ntechnique, without rest."
5186,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"By the time I was your age, \NI had already killed a man."
5187,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Heh, that's nothing to brag about."
5188,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"At this point in time, \Nyou cannot defeat me in combat."
5189,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm trying to be nice.
5190,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Admit defeat—
5191,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Ow...
5192,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Damn it!
5193,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"My head's cleared a bit, after all the \Npain and that long explanation."
5194,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Yes!
5195,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Gon, go!"
5196,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Kick him while he's down!
5197,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you're eighteen, you're only \Nsix years older than I am."
5198,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Besides, this isn't a battle \Nto see who's stronger."
5199,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's to see who's willing to surrender first.
5200,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I let you kick me on purpose.
5201,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Liar!
5202,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You don't understand...
5203,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,This isn't a warning.
5204,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It's an ultimatum.
5205,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Was it too hard for you to understand?
5206,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Then I'll make it easier for you.
5207,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I'll cut off your legs, so that they can't be reattached."
5208,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,A permanent injury should \Nhelp to wake you up.
5209,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"But first, I'll ask you once more."
5210,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Surrender.
5211,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I won't accept that!
5212,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"I don't want my legs cut off, but I don't want to surrender."
5213,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So let's find a different way to fight!
5214,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Hey... Do you understand \Nyour own situation?!
5215,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Excuse me.
5216,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You don't get to make demands!
5217,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Are you trying to insult me?!
5218,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm seriously gonna cut off your legs!
5219,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But I still will not surrender.
5220,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Besides, if you do that, \NI'll bleed to death."
5221,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"He'll be disqualified if that happens, right?"
5222,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Oh, yes."
5223,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,See?
5224,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Neither of us wants that to happen.
5225,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So let's think of a better way.
5226,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I think he's okay now.
5227,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Gon's taken control.
5228,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,He's so self-centered...
5229,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But he's succeeded in convincing \NHanzo and the rest of us.
5230,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Honestly...
5231,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What is this?
5232,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,The situation hasn't changed.
5233,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Gon hasn't gotten stronger than his opponent.
5234,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,His arm is still broken!
5235,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So why is the brutal \Natmosphere from before suddenly so much lighter?
5236,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You really don't get it...
5237,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you die, you'll never get another chance."
5238,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If I kill you here,"
5239,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I need only try again next year.
5240,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,We are not on equal footing!
5241,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"He's right, Gon."
5242,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"You can try all you want \Nto talk your way out of this, but he's far stronger than you."
5243,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That isn't something you can \Nneutralize on the spot.
5244,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,It all comes down to power.
5245,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Why won't you concede? \NIt's easy to do.
5246,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You can try again next year.
5247,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You value your pride more \Nthan your own life?!
5248,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You're really willing to die for your pride?!
5249,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'm going to find my dad.
5250,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Your dad?
5251,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,My dad is a Hunter.
5252,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So I'm going to become a Hunter \Nand find him!
5253,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I believe that I'll find him one day...
5254,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"But I have a feeling that if I give up now,"
5255,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'll never find him!
5256,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,So I won't surrender.
5257,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If you don't yield, you'll die..."
5258,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,He defies reason.
5259,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I give up. You win.
5260,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I can't kill you.
5261,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But I can't think of a way \Nto make you surrender.
5262,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I'll take this loss and take my \Nchances in the next battle!
5263,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I can't accept that.
5264,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,That's not fair!
5265,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,We both have to think of \Na way to settle this fight!
5266,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Heh, I knew you would say that."
5267,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You fool!
5268,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"There's no point, because you'll \Nnever surrender!"
5269,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But I don't want to win like this!
5270,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,What am I supposed to do?
5271,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,We can work together to figure it out!
5272,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"In other words, I've already \Ngiven up on this match, but you want me to try to win again, while helping to determine a way to \Nmake you feel good about your victory!"
5273,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Is that right?
5274,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Uh-huh!
5275,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,You moron!
5276,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Hey, ref."
5277,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,I lose. Let's move on to the next match.
5278,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Understood.
5279,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,But I want to tell the executive \Ncommittee something first.
5280,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"When he wakes up, he'll probably refuse his passing judgment."
5281,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Because he's a stubborn boy, as we've seen."
5282,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Only one person will fail this round, right?"
5283,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the \Nrest of our fights meaningless?"
5284,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"Gon's victory has been assured, \Nfollowing Hanzo's concession."
5285,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"The Final Phase, to determine \Nthe single failing applicant, has only just begun."
5286,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,Next time: Baffling x Turn Of x Events!
5287,Can't Win x And x Can't Lose!,19,"They got Gon, too!"
5288,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
5289,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
5290,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
5291,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
5292,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
5293,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,They are known...
5294,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,...as Hunters!
5295,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Baffling x Turn Of x Events
5296,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You're awake?
5297,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Where am I?
5298,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"A waiting room, next to the \Narena for the Final Phase."
5299,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Upsie-daisy...
5300,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Right. I was in the middle \Nof the Hunter Exam.
5301,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Your arm will heal quickly.
5302,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The break was very clean.
5303,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"In fact, once it heals, the bone \Nwill be stronger than before."
5304,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"In any case, congratulations on passing the exam."
5305,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Satotz-san, I..."
5306,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You can't.
5307,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Just as someone who has failed \Nthe exam can no longer pass, someone who has passed \Nthe exam can no longer fail."
5308,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The rest is up to you.
5309,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro, you are free to destroy or \Nput away your license."
5310,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"You can even sell it, since no one else will be able to use it."
5311,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"However, a person who has passed the exam will \Nnot be allowed to take it again."
5312,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Professional Hunters are treated well, largely due to our predecessors' efforts."
5313,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Hence, there are many applicants \Nwho harbor ill intentions."
5314,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If it weren't for them, we would accept every person who applied."
5315,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Most professional Hunters consider this card more valuable than their own lives, yet no more than a worthless scrap \Nof paper at the same time."
5316,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The important thing is what you accomplish once \Nyou become a Hunter.
5317,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What I accomplish...
5318,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Gon-kun, you can decide for yourself when \Nyou're ready to use this card."
5319,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I have faith in your judgment.
5320,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Okay.
5321,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,A lot of people helped me reach this point.
5322,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'll use this once I've returned the favor.
5323,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Then allow me to congratulate you.
5324,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Thank you, Satotz-san."
5325,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What about the other applicants?
5326,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"The exam is still going on, right?"
5327,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"No, the exam is over."
5328,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Really?
5329,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day."
5330,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Really?
5331,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The others who passed are currently \Ncompleting a brief orientation.
5332,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You will undergo the orientation later.
5333,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Who failed?
5334,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,It was
5335,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Killua.
5336,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Why did Killua fail?
5337,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"First, let me fill you in on what transpired after you were knocked out."
5338,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That will help you understand \Nwhat occurred.
5339,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,After you fell unconscious...
5340,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"When he wakes up, he'll probably \Nrefuse his license."
5341,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That sounds like something Gon would do.
5342,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Only one person will fail this round, right?"
5343,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the \Nrest of our fights meaningless?"
5344,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Don't worry. Gon has passed.
5345,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Nothing he says can change that.
5346,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me, we still wouldn't be able \Nto revoke his license."
5347,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Very well.
5348,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Why did you let him win?
5349,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Let him win?
5350,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'm sure you knew how to make Gon \Nsurrender without killing him.
5351,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Given your skills.
5352,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"When I torture someone,"
5353,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I expect that person to hate me \Nfor the rest of their life.
5354,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,It's more effective and less stressful.
5355,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"When someone is in pain, their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward \Nthe one responsible for that pain."
5356,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Even with extensive training, it is difficult to suppress \Nthat gleam of hate and rage."
5357,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes.
5358,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Can you believe it?
5359,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I had just broken his arm.
5360,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,But his eyes had already \Nforgotten about that.
5361,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I guess you could say that he won me over.
5362,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If you need a reason, there you go."
5363,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Gon-kun, you were able to \Nwin over your opponent."
5364,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Hanzo said so himself.
5365,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"After that, the second match began."
5366,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka.
5367,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Begin!
5368,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,After the two of them fought for a while...
5369,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Wha—
5370,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I lose.
5371,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Huh?
5372,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,And Kurapika won.
5373,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What did Hisoka say?
5374,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"I don't know, but Hisoka voluntarily conceded."
5375,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle.
5376,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Pokkle found himself in much \Nthe same position as you, but he admitted defeat immediately."
5377,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Sorry, but I won't go easy on you."
5378,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That sealed the deal.
5379,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The fourth match was between \NHisoka and Bodoro.
5380,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"The match was extremely one-sided, but Bodoro refused to give up."
5381,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"However, while Bodoro \Nwas lying on the floor,"
5382,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Hisoka whispered something in his ear.
5383,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,And Bodoro surrendered.
5384,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle, but as soon as the fight began, \NKillua walked away."
5385,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Confidently, he declared..."
5386,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you."
5387,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,He must have felt that he \Ncould win his next match.
5388,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"However,"
5389,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Leorio requested that the sixth match be postponed while Bodoro \Nrecovered from his injuries.
5390,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,So Killua and Gittarackur fought first.
5391,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Begin!
5392,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That was when Killua made a fatal mistake.
5393,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"It's been too long, Kil."
5394,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Brother...
5395,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Hunter Vocabulary
5396,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Illumi
5397,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?
5398,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Yes, his name is Illumi."
5399,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Hey.
5400,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Killua's brother?
5401,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,He used those needles to change \Nthe shape of his face?!
5402,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki.
5403,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I guess.
5404,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Mom was crying.
5405,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Anyone would cry if their \Nson did that to them.
5406,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Tears of joy.
5407,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,She was so happy to see that you'd grown up.
5408,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"But she was worried about you leaving home, so she asked me to check up on you."
5409,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What a coincidence.
5410,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter.
5411,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'm trying to get a license for my next job.
5412,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I don't really want to be a Hunter.
5413,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I just felt like taking the exam.
5414,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I see...
5415,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That's a relief.
5416,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Then I have some advice for you.
5417,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You're not cut out to be a Hunter.
5418,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You were born to be... a killer.
5419,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Is that really what he said?
5420,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Killua mentioned his family before, but they sound crazy..."
5421,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,He wasn't finished yet.
5422,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"You're a puppet of darkness, without passion."
5423,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You don't want anything or wish for anything.
5424,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"As one who lives in the shadows, you can only feel pleasure when people die."
5425,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That's how Dad and I raised you.
5426,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What would you accomplish \Nby becoming a Hunter?
5427,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"True,"
5428,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I don't desire to become a Hunter.
5429,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,But...
5430,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I do have something I want...
5431,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You don't.
5432,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I do!
5433,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,There's something I really want!
5434,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Tell me what it is that you want.
5435,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,What's wrong?
5436,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"There's nothing you really want, is there?"
5437,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That's not it!
5438,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I want to become friends with Gon...
5439,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'm sick of killing people...
5440,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"I want to become friends with Gon, and to live a normal life..."
5441,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That's impossible.
5442,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You'll never be able to make friends.
5443,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Your only concern when you meet someone \Nis whether you should kill them.
5444,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That's how you were trained.
5445,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You just don't know how to classify Gon because he's too dazzling for your eyes.
5446,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You don't actually want to \Nbecome friends with him.
5447,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You're wrong...
5448,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If you stay with him, you'll end up wanting to kill him one day."
5449,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You'll get the urge to see if \Nyou can kill him or not.
5450,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Because you have the soul of a killer.
5451,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,As we mentioned before...
5452,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Yeah, I know!"
5453,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Killua!
5454,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I don't give a damn if he's your brother.
5455,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,He's a worthless piece of crap!
5456,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Don't listen to him!
5457,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Just beat the crap out of \Nhim like usual and win!
5458,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You want to become friends with Gon?
5459,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Are you daft?
5460,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You already are friends!
5461,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'm sure that's how Gon feels!
5462,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Really?
5463,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Hell, yeah, idiot!"
5464,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Really... That's no good.
5465,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,He considers Kil a friend.
5466,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Okay, I'll kill Gon."
5467,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,A killer doesn't need any friends.
5468,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,They'll only slow you down.
5469,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Where is he?
5470,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,P-Please wait!
5471,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The match is still...
5472,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Where is he?
5473,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The waiting room over there...
5474,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Thank you.
5475,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,This won't do.
5476,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I need a Hunter license to do my job...
5477,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"But if I kill them, I'll fail, and Kil will pass automatically."
5478,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Oh, darn. The same thing \Nwill happen if I kill Gon."
5479,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I know!
5480,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'll pass the exam before killing Gon.
5481,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Bastard...
5482,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If I wait until after passing the exam,"
5483,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"I can kill everyone here and \Nstill keep my license, right?"
5484,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Yes, according to the rules."
5485,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Did you hear that, Kil?"
5486,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You have to beat me if \Nyou want to save Gon.
5487,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Will you fight me for your friend's sake?
5488,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You can't do it.
5489,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Because you're more worried about whether or not you can defeat me.
5490,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,And you already have your answer:
5491,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"""I'm not strong enough to beat my brother."""
5492,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"""Never fight an enemy you can't beat."""
5493,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I drilled that into you...
5494,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Don't move!
5495,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If you move an inch, I'll assume \Nthat the fight has begun."
5496,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"And if our bodies make contact, that will also mean the fight has begun."
5497,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,There's only one way to stop me.
5498,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You know what that is.
5499,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,But don't forget...
5500,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die."
5501,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Take him out, Killua!"
5502,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,We won't let him kill you or Gon!
5503,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"We'll stop him, whatever it takes!"
5504,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Let him have it!
5505,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I surrender.
5506,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I lose...
5507,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Oh, that's good!"
5508,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Then the battle's over.
5509,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"I lied, Kil."
5510,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I was lying about killing Gon.
5511,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,That was just a little test.
5512,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,But now I have my answer.
5513,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You don't have the right to make friends.
5514,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Nor do you need friends.
5515,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"You should just listen to Dad and me, \Nand do your job as you always have."
5516,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"When the time comes,"
5517,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam.
5518,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,You don't need a license yet.
5519,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"After that, he was reduced \Nto a shell of himself."
5520,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Leorio and Kurapika tried to help, but he wouldn't respond."
5521,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The sixth match was between \NLeorio and Bodoro.
5522,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Bodoro had recovered, \Nbut when the match began..."
5523,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Begin!
5524,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,It was over in a second.
5525,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Killua had killed Bodoro.
5526,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,The committee disqualified him.
5527,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Gon-kun!
5528,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Where is everyone?
5529,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"You need more rest, Gon-kun..."
5530,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Gon.
5531,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Apologize to Killua!
5532,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Gon was angry.
5533,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,"Illumi had trampled on his brother's desire to become \Nfriends with Gon, abandoning Killua to despair."
5534,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,And Gon was angry.
5535,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Next time: Some x Brother x Trouble!
5536,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Do Leorio and I look alike?
5537,Baffling x Turn Of x Events!,20,Get out of here...
5538,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
5539,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
5540,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
5541,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
5542,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
5543,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,They are known...
5544,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,...as Hunters!
5545,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon-kun!
5546,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Where is everyone?
5547,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"You need more rest, Gon-kun..."
5548,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Some x Brother x Trouble
5549,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"After Gon learned why Killua \Nhad been disqualified, he was furious with Gittarackur..."
5550,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Rather, Killua's brother, Illumi."
5551,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Apologize to Killua!
5552,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Apologize? For what?
5553,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You don't know what you did wrong?
5554,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Nope.
5555,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You don't have the right to be his brother.
5556,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Must I earn the right to be his brother?
5557,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,He doesn't need to earn the \Nright to be my friend!
5558,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This boy is...
5559,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Don't bother apologizing.
5560,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Just take me to see Killua.
5561,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,What will you do then?
5562,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That should be obvious...
5563,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'm gonna rescue Killua!
5564,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You make it sound as \Nthough I kidnapped him...
5565,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,He walked away on his own.
5566,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,But it wasn't by choice.
5567,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,He was being manipulated by you people.
5568,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It's the same thing as kidnapping him!
5569,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"We happened to be discussing \Nthis very subject, Gon."
5570,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Kurapika and Leorio have both \Nlodged complaints.
5571,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The committee has been discussing the fairness of Killua's disqualification.
5572,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Killua had been behaving in a strange manner during and \Nsince his battle with the man who called himself Gittarackur!
5573,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I believe that he was hypnotized \Ninto committing murder.
5574,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Under normal circumstances, it would be impossible to use \Nhypnosis to induce a person to kill."
5575,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"However, as Killua was raised \Nin a family of assassins, murder was a part of his daily life, so it's natural that he would lack \Nthe ethical restraint of most!"
5576,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I want to mention that the attack happened during the \Nmatch between Bodoro and me.
5577,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It's possible that he was trying to help me.
5578,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Given that, the one who should be disqualified is me."
5579,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"In any case,"
5580,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Killua was not in control of his own actions.
5581,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Thus, he should not have been disqualified!"
5582,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That is mere speculation.
5583,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,There is no proof.
5584,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,There were no clear signs of manipulation.
5585,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"In fact, I would question the claim that he was hypnotized."
5586,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I agree that the incident occurred after the battle between Leorio \Nand Bodoro had begun.
5587,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"At that point, both fighters \Nwere evenly matched."
5588,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bodoro had more experience.
5589,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"But in terms of raw combat ability, \NLeorio was the stronger."
5590,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,There was no need for Killua to interfere.
5591,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,There was some other funny \Nbusiness happening.
5592,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Like when you fought Hisoka.
5593,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Back then, what did he say to you?"
5594,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Neither of you seemed particularly tired.
5595,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"But Hisoka whispered something in your ear, right before conceding."
5596,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's pretty strange.
5597,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"I'd understand surrendering after your \Nopponent whispers something to you, as happened with Hanzo and me, \Nor Bodoro and Hisoka."
5598,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Because we were under \Nconsiderable pressure.
5599,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"But in your case, the exact opposite happened."
5600,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I have to wonder if you struck \Nsome sort of bargain.
5601,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you're going to question \Nanything that seems odd, your own victory was quite odd, indeed."
5602,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you have nothing to hide, \Nyou should tell us what he said."
5603,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Right now.
5604,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I have no obligation to tell you.
5605,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Maybe not, but I believe you owe it to us."
5606,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Not really.
5607,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you consider my victory to be odd, a victory by default would be equally odd."
5608,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,What?!
5609,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,None of that matters...
5610,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Come on...
5611,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I want to get this lecture \Nover with so I can leave.
5612,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, now..."
5613,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,None of that matters!
5614,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It's pointless to argue over whether \Nsomeone should have passed.
5615,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you aren't happy about passing, keep working until you're satisfied."
5616,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If Killua retakes the Hunter Exam, \Nhe'll definitely pass!"
5617,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"It's unfortunate that he failed this time, \Nbut it is what it is."
5618,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,What does matter...
5619,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you've been forcing Killua to kill, \Nagainst his will, all this time,"
5620,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'll make you pay!
5621,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Make me pay?
5622,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"What, exactly, will you do?"
5623,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I won't do anything.
5624,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Only, once I rescue Killua, \NI'll never let you see him again!"
5625,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Ahem.
5626,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Is everyone finished?
5627,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon is absolutely correct.
5628,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You must decide for yourselves \Nif you were worthy of passing.
5629,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"You may complain about \Nthe results all you like, but we will not be changing our minds."
5630,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Killua has been disqualified.
5631,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,And the rest of you have passed the exam.
5632,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Okay, then I shall continue the orientation."
5633,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The cards I've passed out \Nare your Hunter Licenses.
5634,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"This card allows you to enter 90% of the countries \Nthat limit immigration, as well as 75% of the restricted \Nareas in the world."
5635,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Crazy...
5636,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"This card also provides free access \Nto 95% of public facilities, and a line of credit that rivals \Nlarge corporations."
5637,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you sell the card, you'll have enough \Nmoney to last seven lifetimes."
5638,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"And if you keep it, you'll still \Nbe living in comfort."
5639,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,So take extra care that your \Nlicense isn't lost or stolen.
5640,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You won't receive a replacement.
5641,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"According to our estimates, \None in five Hunters lose their card within a year of receiving it."
5642,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"As a Hunter, your first challenge \Nis to protect your card."
5643,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The rest is up to you.
5644,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Rise above challenges, \Nbelieve in your own strength, and fulfill your dreams."
5645,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Then, we now declare the seven members \Nhere to be new Hunters!"
5646,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Hunter Vocabulary
5647,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,License
5648,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gittarackur...
5649,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Tell me where Killua is.
5650,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Are you really going to take him away?
5651,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I think that's a bad idea.
5652,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I don't care what you think!
5653,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Killua is my friend.
5654,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'm taking him with me.
5655,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Do they feel the same way?
5656,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You bet.
5657,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Fine.
5658,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I doubt you'll be able to \Nmake it there anyway.
5659,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Killua went home.
5660,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Home?
5661,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Kukuroo Mountain.
5662,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Our family lives at the very top.
5663,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Kukuroo Mountain?
5664,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Got it. Thanks.
5665,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Is it really okay for an assassin to give away \Nhis base of operations?
5666,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Sure, it isn't a secret or anything."
5667,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The locals all know where we live.
5668,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Well, I'm sure they'll see the \Nlight once they arrive."
5669,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We live in completely different worlds...
5670,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, this?"
5671,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Yep, it's broken."
5672,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,He has incredible potential.
5673,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I can understand why you want \Nto see him grow up.
5674,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Didn't I tell you?
5675,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,But that makes him all the more dangerous.
5676,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This would be the best chance to...
5677,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon is my prey.
5678,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Touch him, and you'll suffer \Nthe consequences."
5679,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I know.
5680,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"I've only known you for a short while, \Nbut I know your tastes."
5681,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"So, Hisoka."
5682,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,What are you going to do now?
5683,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Wait patiently.
5684,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,For the fruit to ripen...
5685,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Kukuroo Mountain?
5686,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Never heard of it before.
5687,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Kurapika, do you know where it is?"
5688,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, Kurapika!"
5689,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Huh?
5690,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, what is it?"
5691,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The mountain!
5692,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,He said something about Kukuroo Mountain.
5693,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Do you know where it might be?
5694,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"No, I don't..."
5695,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We can look it up online.
5696,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Yo!
5697,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, Hanzo-san!"
5698,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'm going back to my country.
5699,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"It was a short, yet seemingly long \Nacquaintance, but I had fun."
5700,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,So did I.
5701,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"If you ever visit my country, let me know."
5702,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I can show you the best tourist spots!
5703,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,See ya!
5704,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bye!
5705,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Cloud-Hidden Ninja \NHanzo
5706,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,A shinobi who tries to leave an impression...
5707,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Hey.
5708,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Sorry about getting so excited back there.
5709,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"No, I also lost control."
5710,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Forgive me.
5711,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"No, I only got mad because you were right."
5712,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I was using you to take out my \Nfrustration for winning by default.
5713,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,But I'm over that now.
5714,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Since I passed, I'm going to make the best of it!"
5715,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The question is what to do next.
5716,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Yes, you're right."
5717,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"I'm going to travel the world, \Ngathering information and discovering new species, \Nas an Exotic Game Hunter."
5718,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,An Exotic Game Hunter...
5719,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, what's that?"
5720,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, this?"
5721,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You can use this to obtain \Nall kinds of information.
5722,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Is there anything you'd like to know?
5723,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I can look it up on the spot.
5724,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Oh...
5725,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Can you look up a Hunter named Ging?
5726,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Ging Freecss.
5727,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Sure, hold on..."
5728,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Satotz?
5729,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, who is this Ging guy?"
5730,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Huh?
5731,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,All information related to him is behind a tight security system that requires a bunch of different accesses.
5732,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"He has some serious influence, \Neven at the national level."
5733,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Huh? Really?
5734,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Forget it, then..."
5735,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Looks like your dad is someone really special.
5736,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Okay, let me know if anything comes up."
5737,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This is my e-mail address.
5738,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bye.
5739,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bye!
5740,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We should have asked him to \Nlook up Kukuroo Mountain.
5741,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's right.
5742,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It's okay.
5743,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"As Chairman Netero was saying, \Nwe are all Hunters now."
5744,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It's a bad idea to let other Hunters \Nknow what you're doing.
5745,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We can look it up ourselves.
5746,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon-kun.
5747,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Satotz-san!
5748,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Gon-kun, you forgot this."
5749,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, right..."
5750,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Thanks!
5751,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,And do you have a moment?
5752,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We'll be waiting in the lobby.
5753,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Okay!
5754,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Forgive me, but I couldn't help but \Noverhear your conversation."
5755,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"I happen to specialize in the \Ndiscovery, restoration, and preservation of ancient ruins."
5756,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"When I first began,"
5757,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I was only focused on the glory \Nderived from new discoveries.
5758,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"But after watching a certain Hunter at work,"
5759,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I came to feel ashamed.
5760,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"That Hunter would discover ruins, spend his own money to \Ncompletely restore them, and take steps to preserve the \Nruins for future generations, thus ensuring that ordinary people \Nwould have a chance to see them."
5761,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I was more impressed by \Nhis dedication to his job than by the beauty of the ruins.
5762,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The work he did to preserve those ruins has been documented in manuals \Nused around the world.
5763,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"And this Hunter, Gon-kun, was Ging Freecss, the man \Nyou were asking about."
5764,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"I wished to meet him, so I did some investigating."
5765,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"However, quite frankly, he is an enigma."
5766,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I wasn't able to learn anything about him...
5767,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Really? Figures.
5768,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,My goal is to become a Hunter like him.
5769,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,My dream is to thank him in person one day.
5770,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Uh-huh.
5771,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's all I had to say.
5772,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Sorry for interrupting you.
5773,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"It's okay. Thanks for everything, Satotz-san."
5774,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bye!
5775,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Oh...
5776,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon-kun.
5777,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Hmm?
5778,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, never mind..."
5779,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Take care of yourself.
5780,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Yeah. You, too."
5781,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Bye!
5782,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"First, let's look up Kukuroo Mountain."
5783,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Yeah.
5784,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Kukuroo Mountain...
5785,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,There it is.
5786,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"""Kukuroo Mountain."
5787,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"A 3,722 meter-high mountain, in the Dentora region of \Nthe Republic of Padokea."""
5788,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,The Republic of Padokea?
5789,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Never heard of it.
5790,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Where is it?
5791,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Hold on.
5792,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'll bring up a map.
5793,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This is the Republic of Padokea.
5794,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It should be fine. \NIt appears to be a stable country.
5795,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,It allows ordinary tourists.
5796,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's where we'll find Killua?
5797,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"By airship, it will take three days to reach..."
5798,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,When do we leave?
5799,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Today! Right now!
5800,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Yeah, no objection from me!"
5801,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Understood. Then, I'll order tickets."
5802,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,What's going on?
5803,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We've been stuck in one place forever.
5804,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This won't do.
5805,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,We'll be late for our flight.
5806,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Pops! Do something!
5807,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I'm afraid I can't help this traffic.
5808,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,And this is the only road.
5809,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,In that case...
5810,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Yahoo!
5811,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, Gon!"
5812,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Do you realize how far away the airport is?
5813,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I want to rescue Killua as soon \Nas humanly possible!
5814,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Fine, you win."
5815,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This reminds me of the Hunter Exam.
5816,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's right.
5817,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,This is nothing compared \Nto the Hunter Exam.
5818,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Yeah...
5819,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You got that right.
5820,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Okay...
5821,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Race you to the airport!
5822,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Ready...
5823,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Go!
5824,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Gon and his friends set off for \Nthe Republic of Padokea.
5825,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Their destination is Kukuroo Mountain, \Nwhere Killua's home is located."
5826,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Satotz.
5827,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Menchi. Buhara.
5828,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Hey, Satotz..."
5829,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That was a close call.
5830,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,You were watching?
5831,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That boy is a mystery...
5832,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I find myself wanting to help him.
5833,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,I almost let the cat out of the bag.
5834,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,About how the real Hunter Exam hasn't ended yet.
5835,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,Next time: A x Dangerous x Watchdog!
5836,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Fetch, doggie!"
5837,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,That's it...
5838,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Roll over, doggie!"
5839,Some x Brother x Trouble!,21,"Oh, yeah!"
5840,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This country allows ordinary tourists.
5841,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That's where we'll find Killua?
5842,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"By airship, it will take three days to reach..."
5843,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,When do we leave?
5844,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Today! Right now!
5845,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yeah, no objection from me!"
5846,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Understood. Then, I'll order tickets."
5847,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'm from a family of assassins.
5848,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So they're all assassins.
5849,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,And the family has really high hopes for me...
5850,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But I can't stand it.
5851,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Who wants to have their life \Nplanned out for them?
5852,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Killua...
5853,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"What's with the long face, Gon?"
5854,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We'll be in the Republic of \NPadokea by morning.
5855,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You'll see Killua soon enough.
5856,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yep!
5857,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We'll definitely take Killua back with us!
5858,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,A x Dangerous x Watchdog
5859,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived in the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives."
5860,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,There it is.
5861,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The base for this family of \Nassassins is on that mountain?
5862,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It sure looks creepy...
5863,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yes.
5864,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Once we reach our destination, we should start gathering information."
5865,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Okay.
5866,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Kukuroo Mountain?
5867,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"In that case, you should take the \Nscenic mountain bus tour over there."
5868,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"The tour only runs once a day, \Nbut you'll have a guide to show you around."
5869,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Okay...
5870,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Thank you for taking the \NLamentation Tour today.
5871,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain, home to the famous Zoldyck \Nfamily of assassins."
5872,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Look.
5873,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,They obviously aren't tourists.
5874,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yes...
5875,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Everyone?
5876,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Please look to your right.
5877,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"That is Kukuroo Mountain, \Nwhere the Zoldyck family lives."
5878,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain, and the Zoldyck estate is \Nsomewhere on that mountain."
5879,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But no one has ever actually seen it.
5880,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"The Zoldyck family includes ten members: a great-grandfather, grandfather, \Ngrandmother, father, mother, and then, there are five children."
5881,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,All of them are assassins!
5882,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Then, let us approach the mountain."
5883,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That's really something.
5884,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.
5885,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Also known as the Door to Hades because no one who's entered \Nhas ever returned alive.
5886,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"To enter, you must pass through the door beside the security checkpoint."
5887,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"But the area beyond the gate \Nis private property, so we can't proceed."
5888,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hold on!
5889,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This is the front gate?
5890,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The mountain's all the way over there!
5891,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Correct...
5892,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain, as well as the surrounding land."
5893,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This whole area is their backyard?
5894,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Hey, guide..."
5895,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yes?
5896,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,What do we have to do to get inside?
5897,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Little boy, were you listening \Nto my explanation?"
5898,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Uh-huh.
5899,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But...
5900,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!"
5901,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Assassins live inside.
5902,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's all a sham.
5903,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Huh?
5904,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.
5905,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Just a photo of their faces is \Nworth a hundred million.
5906,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Seriously?!
5907,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Damn!
5908,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I should have taken a picture of Killua!
5909,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's just another case of rampant rumors masking a mundane truth.
5910,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Open the gate!
5911,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I-I cannot do that.
5912,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The master would not be pleased.
5913,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Don't worry.
5914,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We're going to kill your master.
5915,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Ouch...
5916,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Are you okay?
5917,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, I'm fine."
5918,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Man... Now Mike's going to end up \Neating between meals again.
5919,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Huh?
5920,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Please...
5921,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.
5922,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Mike!
5923,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Don't blame me if you get fat!
5924,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,What was that?
5925,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Hey, boys!"
5926,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,What are you doing?
5927,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Get on the bus!
5928,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You can leave.
5929,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We're staying here.
5930,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Huh?
5931,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I see.
5932,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So you're young Killua's friends.
5933,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'm happy to hear that.
5934,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I've worked here for twenty years, but this is the first time any friends have come to visit."
5935,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Since I work here, I shouldn't say this, but the place is rather lonely."
5936,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,No one ever visits.
5937,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Though we do see a lot of those...
5938,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual."
5939,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.
5940,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Anyway, I'm glad you're here."
5941,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Thank you.
5942,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Don't mention it.
5943,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,However...
5944,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I cannot let you inside.
5945,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?
5946,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Its name is Mike.
5947,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.
5948,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"It only obeys family, \Nand will attack anyone else."
5949,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The beast still follows the order its master gave it ten years ago...
5950,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,To kill every single intruder.
5951,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"But technically, he isn't following the order."
5952,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Because he keeps eating them...
5953,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Anyway, I can't let you inside."
5954,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I wouldn't want to reduce young \NKillua's friends to skeletons.
5955,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Sir, how is it that you're safe?"
5956,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"You go inside, correct?"
5957,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If you never needed to enter, \Nyou wouldn't have a key."
5958,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Quite perceptive of you.
5959,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But you're only half right.
5960,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I require no key to get inside.
5961,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This key is for intruders.
5962,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,A key for intruders?
5963,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"For some reason, eighty to ninety percent of intruders \Nattempt to use the front gate."
5964,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If I don't open the gate for them, they'll try to break it down."
5965,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Such troublemakers...
5966,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So we added a locked door to one side.
5967,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"The intruders take the key \Nfrom the helpless guard, and then Mike eats them."
5968,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,A locked door...
5969,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That's it!
5970,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"As you just realized, I'm not a guard."
5971,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I merely clean up after Mike.
5972,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,And the actual gate isn't locked!
5973,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Exactly.
5974,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,What?
5975,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hunter Vocabulary
5976,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Lamentation Tours
5977,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I've tried pushing and pulling, \Nbut it won't budge!"
5978,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Are you sure it isn't locked?
5979,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You just aren't strong enough.
5980,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That's absurd!
5981,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I've been using all of my strength!
5982,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Just watch.
5983,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.
5984,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Anyone who cannot open this gate is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.
5985,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"As you just saw, the door closes automatically, so you'll want to run in, the second it opens."
5986,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You don't need to worry about Mike.
5987,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He has orders not to attack any who \Nenter through the Testing Gate.
5988,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Still, this is getting tougher as I age..."
5989,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate, so I need to keep in shape."
5990,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I should mention that each of gate \None's doors weighs two tons.
5991,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Two tons?
5992,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You're not supposed to be able to open that!
5993,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Wait, what did you say?"
5994,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Gate one?
5995,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, have a look."
5996,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,There are seven gates.
5997,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"When you go up a gate, the weight doubles."
5998,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Doubles?
5999,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The number of gates that open depends on the amount of strength you use.
6000,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Incidentally, when young Killua returned, he opened gates one through three."
6001,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Gate three?
6002,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That would be twelve tons!
6003,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Sixteen tons, Gon."
6004,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Do you understand now?
6005,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This is what's required just \Nto get in the door.
6006,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,They live in a completely different world.
6007,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Hmm, I don't like it."
6008,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Mister, lend me the key."
6009,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I came here to see my friend, \Nnot to be tested."
6010,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You can consider me an intruder.
6011,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So let me borrow the key.
6012,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll use the intruder's door.
6013,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Gon!
6014,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hey...
6015,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It doesn't matter if you \Nwon't loan me the key.
6016,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes."
6017,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Don't be stupid, Gon!"
6018,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Didn't you see that monster?
6019,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Its arm was bigger than your entire body!
6020,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I won't accept this!
6021,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Why would you test your friends?
6022,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll never enter through that door.
6023,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You are absolutely right.
6024,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"However, forcing your way \Nthrough is impossible."
6025,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Mike will kill you.
6026,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I agree.
6027,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We have plenty of time.
6028,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Let's figure out a way to \Nenter through gate one.
6029,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's no use.
6030,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's not gonna change his mind.
6031,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Indeed...
6032,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key."
6033,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.
6034,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Well, please wait here for a minute."
6035,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hello? This is Zebro.
6036,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Three of young Killua's friends are here to see him.
6037,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yes.
6038,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes."
6039,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, I understand. Yes."
6040,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.
6041,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yep, I got in trouble."
6042,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You called the mansion?
6043,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"No, I was speaking with the \NZoldyck family butler."
6044,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,All communication with the mansion \Nmust go through the butler.
6045,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's very difficult to reach any \Nof the family members.
6046,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Could you call him again?
6047,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll talk to him this time.
6048,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Sure, I guess..."
6049,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But you won't enjoy the experience.
6050,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, this is the butler's office."
6051,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends."
6052,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Is Killua-kun there?
6053,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Killua-sama has no friends.
6054,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, this is the butler's office."
6055,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,How could you possibly know that?!
6056,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Put Killua on the phone!
6057,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?
6058,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yeah.
6059,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens \Nto have a friend named Gon.
6060,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,There is no proof that you are Gon.
6061,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If you put Killua on the phone, \Nhe'll recognize me!"
6062,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,By your voice?
6063,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That isn't a reliable test.
6064,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If you put Killua on the phone, \Nhe'll recognize me!"
6065,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,That was a simple recording.
6066,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,And there are many other ways \Nto mimic a person's voice.
6067,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Next, you'll claim that he'd \Nrecognize you by sight."
6068,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,There are only a few methods by which you could perfectly mimic \Nsomeone's appearance.
6069,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But it still isn't impossible.
6070,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Additionally, it's possible that someone \Nforced you to approach Killua-sama for sinister purposes."
6071,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"As long as the threat exists,"
6072,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.
6073,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The Zoldyck family practices the \Ntrade of assassination.
6074,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Naturally, it has made enemies."
6075,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters from their enemies."
6076,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"I apologize, but please leave."
6077,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hey! Gon!
6078,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Gon!
6079,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's really pissed now.
6080,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's going to climb over the wall...
6081,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,What?
6082,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Hey! Stop it, Gon!"
6083,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's okay. You two can wait here.
6084,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll go by myself.
6085,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I can't let you do that!
6086,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll be fine!
6087,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"No, you won't!"
6088,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Both of you should calm down!
6089,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'm perfectly calm!
6090,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Come down here, Gon!"
6091,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Don't be stupid.
6092,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Gon-kun, I'll give you the key."
6093,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You can go through the door.
6094,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Hold on, pops!"
6095,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We can convince Gon to stop!
6096,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Really?
6097,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,But he appears to be a stubborn boy.
6098,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"To make amends,"
6099,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'll accompany you through the door.
6100,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Huh?
6101,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's possible that Mike may recognize me and decide not to attack.
6102,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Though I'm almost a hundred percent \Ncertain that he'll kill us all.
6103,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You can't do that.
6104,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I don't want to cause you any trouble.
6105,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"No, I'm coming with you."
6106,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The result will be the same if I stay behind.
6107,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,"
6108,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I'd never be able to face him again.
6109,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"If you die,"
6110,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I will also die.
6111,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I understand now.
6112,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I didn't stop to consider your situation.
6113,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Sorry.
6114,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's a good boy.
6115,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's willing to quell his own anger \Nfor another person's sake.
6116,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"He believes in his own strength, as well as in his friends."
6117,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He has a strong heart.
6118,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's likely that Mike \Nwon't frighten him at all.
6119,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"You must like animals, Gon-kun."
6120,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yeah.
6121,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Just as I thought.
6122,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Did you grow up playing in the countryside?
6123,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Yep! How did you know?
6124,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Gon-kun, I'm going to open \Nthe Testing Gate again."
6125,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I want you to see Mike for yourself.
6126,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Hey...
6127,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Is it really okay for us to come in?
6128,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Yes, you'll be safe because you \Nentered through the Testing Gate."
6129,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Mike! Come here!
6130,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Gon-kun, do you understand now?"
6131,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,This is a trained hunting dog.
6132,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,It's nothing like the wild animals \Nyou're accustomed to.
6133,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,You must have expected to be able \Nto communicate with him.
6134,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Until you saw his eyes.
6135,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Mike is currently memorizing the appearances and \Nscents of humans he's never seen.
6136,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,There's nothing else on his mind.
6137,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's like a machine.
6138,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Gon-kun, could you fight him?"
6139,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"No, I'm scared."
6140,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,I don't want to fight him!
6141,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,He's such an honest boy.
6142,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"Well, how long will you be here?"
6143,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Until we meet Killua!
6144,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,We won't leave before then!
6145,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Then please come this way.
6146,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,The Testing Gate...
6147,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,And Mike...
6148,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family lives in a completely different world.
6149,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"However, Gon had promised himself..."
6150,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,"No matter what difficulties awaited him, he would find Killua in the end."
6151,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,Next time: The x Guard's x Duty!
6152,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,5 x 5 = 25.
6153,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,So you know how to do math.
6154,A x Dangerous x Watchdog!,22,5 x 5 = 25!
6155,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"In the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano \Nsurrounded by forest,"
6156,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Kukuroo Mountain.
6157,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The home of the famous Zoldyck \Nfamily of assassins is here.
6158,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Visitors come, every day, \Nhoping for a glimpse of the mansion that no one has ever seen before."
6159,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It is a very popular tourist spot \Nin this nation.
6160,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Lamentation Tours
6161,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Well, how long will you be here?"
6162,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Until we meet Killua!
6163,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We won't leave before then!
6164,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Then please come this way.
6165,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The x Guard's x Duty
6166,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon and his friends have confronted the obstacles that they must overcome in order to meet with Killua.
6167,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What awaits them at their destination?
6168,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Here are the servants' quarters.
6169,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's getting late.
6170,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,So you can stay here tonight.
6171,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Please come in.
6172,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Hey, I'm back!"
6173,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Oh, you rarely bring guests."
6174,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,This is Seaquant.
6175,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He works with me here.
6176,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Good evening.
6177,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"If you managed to win over Zebro, \Nyou must be special."
6178,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Well, make yourselves at home."
6179,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Though it won't be easy here.
6180,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You want to see young Killua?
6181,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,That's a riot!
6182,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Sorry. But we're dead serious.
6183,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Then let me give you a warning:
6184,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Give up, and go home."
6185,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What was that?!
6186,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Zebro told you about the \NTesting Gate, right?"
6187,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,That should give you an idea of \Nwhat this place is like.
6188,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We understand that it won't be easy.
6189,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But I'm not leaving.
6190,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Not until I see Killua!
6191,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"When Killua was in trouble, \NI wasn't there for him."
6192,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"If I had been there,"
6193,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I could have stopped Killua!
6194,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Killua is my close friend!
6195,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We understand.
6196,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Then why not do some training here?
6197,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Training?
6198,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Hey, Zebro..."
6199,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Listen to me, Gon-kun."
6200,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You three are allowed to work together to open the door.
6201,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"With a little training, it should be possible."
6202,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,How about it?
6203,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I don't like the idea of being tested...
6204,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But if there is no other way...
6205,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We'll just have to do it!
6206,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yep!
6207,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Then I'll need you to put these on.
6208,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,How is this so heavy...
6209,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It weighs fifty kilograms.
6210,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Please wear it at all times, \Nexcept while you sleep."
6211,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.
6212,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Please have some tea.
6213,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What the...?
6214,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The cups weigh twenty kilograms.
6215,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,This teapot weighs forty kilograms.
6216,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,All furniture and utensils in this house weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.
6217,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I see... So this will serve as training.
6218,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's useless.
6219,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,They'll give up in two or three days.
6220,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What was that?
6221,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Seaquant, I believe that \Nyour shift has already started."
6222,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Oh, that's right..."
6223,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Sorry about that.
6224,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He isn't a bad person.
6225,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"By the way, where's the bathroom?"
6226,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Through the door over there.
6227,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'm guessing that the door is also...
6228,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms."
6229,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Five hundred?
6230,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What?! Get out!
6231,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I can't hold it in!
6232,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Kalluto-chan, open the door."
6233,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?"
6234,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"It's no use, Mama."
6235,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He isn't even the least bit sorry.
6236,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We need to make him suffer more.
6237,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Milluki! Shut your mouth!
6238,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Kil, stop being so stubborn \Nand say that you're sorry."
6239,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Oh, right. That friend of yours..."
6240,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Gon, was it?"
6241,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"He'd be better off just leaving, but it sounds like he wants \Nto try the Testing Gate."
6242,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon is here...
6243,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Milluki! You're talking too much!
6244,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Listen to me, Kil..."
6245,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You didn't even tell me?!
6246,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Don't yell at Mama!
6247,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I told you to shut your mouth!
6248,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil..."
6249,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Since it's impossible for him \Nto open the front gate.
6250,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He'll do it.
6251,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What?
6252,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon will open it.
6253,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Oh, that's nice."
6254,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But he'll still never make it here...
6255,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon will...
6256,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He'll do it.
6257,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He will definitely make it here.
6258,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Wait, Gon!"
6259,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You just watch.
6260,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Huh? Why?
6261,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You need to let your arm heal first.
6262,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"As long as Kurapika and I can open it, \Nit doesn't matter."
6263,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Let us handle this!
6264,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Okay.
6265,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Let's do this, Kurapika!"
6266,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yeah!
6267,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's impossible...
6268,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,No use... It won't budge an inch.
6269,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Damn!
6270,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But we just started our training.
6271,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"If we work hard enough, we can do it!"
6272,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I wish I could share your optimism.
6273,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,This will never work.
6274,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You kids need to wake up.
6275,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"In that case, you should quit watching us \Nand do your job!"
6276,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon is one of us.
6277,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,And he wishes to see his friend.
6278,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's only right that we should help him.
6279,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Okay, let's give it another shot!"
6280,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yeah!
6281,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Man, you can't just mindlessly push."
6282,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Match your timing.
6283,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"You have to push both doors, \Nwith all your strength, simultaneously."
6284,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Or the gate won't ever open.
6285,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Match our timing...
6286,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,And push both doors with all our \Nstrength simultaneously...
6287,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Okay!
6288,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,One!
6289,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Two!
6290,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Three!
6291,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Leorio! Kurapika!
6292,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It moved.
6293,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Hunter Vocabulary
6294,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Testing Gate
6295,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What?
6296,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The Testing Gate?
6297,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,And?
6298,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Oh, well..."
6299,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I just wanted to let you know.
6300,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Very well.
6301,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,He's always so cold.
6302,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Hey, why don't you try removing \Nthose vests today?"
6303,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Oh? Music to my ears!
6304,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yeah!
6305,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Without them, we can \Ndefinitely open the gate now."
6306,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Let's do this, Kurapika!"
6307,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yeah!
6308,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,One... Two...
6309,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Three!
6310,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Damn it...
6311,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It won't move any farther.
6312,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"One last spurt, Leorio..."
6313,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Got it!
6314,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon...
6315,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Why are you using your left arm?
6316,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's okay.
6317,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,My arm's healed now.
6318,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Healed?
6319,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Are you sure, Gon?"
6320,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yep!
6321,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Anyway, we have to push together, right?"
6322,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Right, let's push!"
6323,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Here we go!
6324,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,One!
6325,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Two!
6326,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Three!
6327,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It's opening...
6328,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Ow...
6329,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It opened.
6330,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yes!
6331,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"We did it, Gon!"
6332,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Uh-huh!
6333,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Follow the path, and head for the mountain."
6334,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The mansion should be somewhere up there.
6335,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"I'm ashamed to admit that even though I've worked \Nhere for twenty years,"
6336,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I've never been up the mountain.
6337,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Sorry that I couldn't be any help.
6338,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"No, that isn't true."
6339,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You've both been a huge help.
6340,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Thank you for everything!
6341,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Goodbye!
6342,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Those kids are really something.
6343,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,They might be able to \Nmake it to the mansion.
6344,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Won't happen. They'll just \Nget themselves killed.
6345,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Speaking from your experience \Nthree years ago?
6346,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.
6347,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,That made it painfully clear that I wasn't on their level.
6348,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,So you decided to work here.
6349,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Sorry...
6350,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But the masters and servants \Nare all monsters.
6351,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Once you step into their territory...
6352,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The Testing Gate opened?
6353,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Yes, ma'am."
6354,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,This is a critical time for Killua.
6355,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We cannot allow anyone near him!
6356,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Especially not those unnecessary friends...
6357,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Do you understand?
6358,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Yes, ma'am."
6359,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Leave.
6360,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You're trespassing on private property.
6361,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I cannot allow you to pass \Nwithout permission.
6362,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We called ahead.
6363,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,And we came through the Testing Gate.
6364,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,The butlers did not give you \Npermission to enter.
6365,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What do we need to do to get permission?
6366,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"I said I was Killua's friend, \Nbut they wouldn't put him on."
6367,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I wouldn't know.
6368,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Because no one has ever \Nreceived permission.
6369,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Then we'll have to trespass!
6370,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I suppose so.
6371,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"In any case, this is where I draw the line."
6372,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"If you take one step beyond this line,"
6373,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'll remove you by force.
6374,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon!
6375,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Damn it!
6376,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Leorio! Kurapika!
6377,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Don't interfere.
6378,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Let me handle this.
6379,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Ow...
6380,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We don't intend to fight you.
6381,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,We just want to see Killua.
6382,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,It doesn't matter what your motives are.
6383,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'm simply following my orders.
6384,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You can try all you want.
6385,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'll never let you pass.
6386,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I will pass...
6387,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'm going to see Killua!
6388,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Welcome home,"
6389,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Killua-sama.
6390,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Yeah.
6391,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I made... a friend...
6392,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Stop it.
6393,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Stay away!
6394,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Cut it out!
6395,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Don't you realize how futile this is?!
6396,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Why don't you stop him?
6397,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Aren't you his friends?
6398,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What's the problem?
6399,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'm just here to see my friend.
6400,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I'm just here to see Killua!
6401,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Why do I have to do this?!
6402,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Hey.
6403,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Huh?
6404,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I crossed the line.
6405,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Aren't you supposed to hit me?
6406,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You're different from Mike.
6407,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"You may try to hide your feelings, but you have a heart."
6408,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"When I mentioned Killua, \Nyour eyes softened for a moment."
6409,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Please...
6410,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Help Killua-sama—
6411,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Honestly...
6412,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What was that servant babbling about?
6413,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,She made it sound like we're \Nbeing mean to Killua.
6414,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,A worthless apprentice had \Nthe nerve to insult us!
6415,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,You must be Gon.
6416,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I heard about you from Illumi.
6417,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Killua knows that you're here.
6418,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I have a message for you from Kil...
6419,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"""Thank you for coming."
6420,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,I really appreciate it.
6421,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,But I can't see you right now.
6422,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"Sorry."""
6423,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Gon and his friends have finally made it \Ninside the Zoldyck estate.
6424,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"But now, they face their \Ngreatest obstacle yet."
6425,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,"A sad message from Killua, saying that he can't see them."
6426,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,Next time: The x Zoldyck x Family!
6427,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,What is Killua to you?
6428,The x Guard's x Duty!,23,My big brother!
6429,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"In the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano \Nsurrounded by forest,"
6430,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kukuroo Mountain.
6431,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,The home of the famous Zoldyck \Nfamily of assassins is here.
6432,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Visitors come, every day, \Nhoping for a glimpse of the mansion that no one has ever seen before."

6435,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I have a message for you from Kil...
6436,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"""Thank you for coming."
6437,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I really appreciate it.
6438,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But I can't see you right now.
6439,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Sorry."""
6440,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,The x Zoldyck x Family
6441,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio have advanced a little closer to the mansion."
6442,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Meanwhile...
6443,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'm home.
6444,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Well, no one's around."
6445,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Welcome back.
6446,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,How did work go?
6447,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Fine.
6448,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Does that mean you dispatched your target?
6449,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'm sure you were watching me \Nfrom a distance.
6450,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Mom's waiting for you inside.
6451,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I don't want to see her.
6452,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Ah.
6453,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Did you need something?
6454,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I wanted to say hello.
6455,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Are you new here?
6456,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Yes.
6457,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"While you were away, \NI was hired as an apprentice butler."
6458,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,My name is Canary.
6459,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Here. You can have this.
6460,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"No, thank you."
6461,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama."
6462,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.
6463,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I cannot do that.
6464,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I am a servant.
6465,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,And you are my employer.
6466,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Tsk... That's lame.
6467,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"You were using the Shadow Step, right?"
6468,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Shadow Step?
6469,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"The technique where you move silently,\Nso you won't be noticed."
6470,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's one of the first assassination \Ntechniques we learn in the Zoldyck family.
6471,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Is that so?
6472,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I must have learned it while \Ngrowing up in Meteor City.
6473,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Meteor City?
6474,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,My hometown.
6475,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's a city that has been erased from this world.
6476,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Huh, never heard of it."
6477,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.
6478,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,That's why many members of the mafia and the Phantom \NTroupe come from there.
6479,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'd like to visit some time.
6480,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"When you visit, I can serve as your guide."
6481,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.
6482,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Rhythm Echo?
6483,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.
6484,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"You move at a certain rhythm, \Ncreating afterimages."
6485,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I see...
6486,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It appears we have intruders.
6487,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Many intruders.
6488,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Let Mike handle it.
6489,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,The master has ordered that \NMike be restrained today.
6490,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,They wish to test my abilities.
6491,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,We'll split up and look for their mansion.
6492,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Leave.
6493,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Who are you?
6494,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,There is no need for me to answer that question.
6495,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You are trespassing on private property.
6496,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I cannot allow you to pass without permission.
6497,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Can you stop us?
6498,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's obvious that you stand no chance.
6499,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life."
6500,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"If you take one step past this line,"
6501,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I shall use force to remove you.
6502,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What was that?
6503,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"You can stand back and watch, boss..."
6504,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,We'll take care of this.
6505,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Let's go!
6506,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Don't mock us!
6507,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Bitch!
6508,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Get her!
6509,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Do you wish to continue?
6510,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"After all that, she hasn't \Neven broken a sweat..."
6511,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?
6512,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Hardly.
6513,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I am but an apprentice butler.
6514,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"With your abilities, you're not even a match for the butlers, let alone the Zoldyck family."
6515,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,A futile effort...
6516,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'm telling you that it's useless!
6517,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"As a Hunter,"
6518,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I cannot allow a little girl \Nlike you to defeat me.
6519,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Prepare yourself!
6520,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What?
6521,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Die!
6522,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I-I'm sorry!
6523,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Please spare my life!
6524,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Zebro-san...
6525,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You noticed my presence?
6526,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Could you clean this up?
6527,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Sure, that's my job."
6528,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Plus, Mike is starving."
6529,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Huh?
6530,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,H-Help!
6531,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You already knew the Rhythm Echo.
6532,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Yes... Forgive me.
6533,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You think you're stronger than I am.
6534,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Absolutely not.
6535,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Really?
6536,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"So, I don't have anyone to play with."
6537,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Will you be my friend, Canary?"
6538,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"I apologize, Killua-sama."
6539,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Tsk. Lame...
6540,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Let's be friends!
6541,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Gon...

6543,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Canary
6544,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Is she okay?
6545,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Yeah.
6546,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,She's only unconscious.
6547,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Wake up!
6548,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh. Morning, Bro."
6549,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What time is it?
6550,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Don't be too arrogant, Kil!"
6551,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What?
6552,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"I feel really bad about stabbing you, Bro."
6553,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro."
6554,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You're lying!
6555,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You can tell?
6556,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Tsk!
6557,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Hello?
6558,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, Mama?"
6559,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Uh-huh.
6560,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Yep, I understand."
6561,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Kil, your friends are near the butler's office."
6562,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"How about it, Kil?"
6563,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"If I ask Mama, those three can become..."
6564,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Milluki.
6565,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"If you so much as touch them, I'll kill you."
6566,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Forgive me for not introducing myself.
6567,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I am Killua's mother.
6568,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,This is Kalluto.
6569,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Why can't Killua come see us?
6570,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Because he's in solitary confinement.
6571,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Solitary confinement?
6572,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil stabbed me and his brother \Nbefore he ran away from home.
6573,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,That is the story he told us.
6574,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil returned because he regretted his actions.
6575,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,And he voluntarily entered \Nsolitary confinement.
6576,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,So we do not know when he will leave...
6577,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What? Father! What are you doing?!
6578,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Don't do anything hasty!
6579,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,He's finally returned!

6585,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I know that.
6586,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Kil, you can go."
6587,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Okay.
6588,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Man, that hurt."
6589,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Bro, I'm not sorry."
6590,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But I do feel bad.
6591,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,So I let you slap me around.
6592,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What was that?
6593,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Kil, Silva wants to see you."
6594,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Dad?
6595,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Okay.
6596,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Damn it!
6597,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!"
6598,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,That's why he's such an uppity brat...
6599,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,He's special.
6600,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?"
6601,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"It's incredible, sure."
6602,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,He's probably the most talented \NZoldyck in history?
6603,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Mama seems to think so.
6604,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I have to agree.
6605,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Considerable praise.
6606,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But he fails as an assassin because he's so moody.
6607,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Moody?
6608,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,A kid who wants to make friends \Ncan't lead the Zoldyck family.
6609,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"In the end, he's just a crybaby."
6610,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Mentally weak.
6611,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,That is true...
6612,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Right? Take me.
6613,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.
6614,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, that's right."
6615,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"The bomb I'll use next time \Nis awesome, Grandpa!"
6616,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's super-compact.
6617,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"I attached it to a female mosquito, and it's triggered to explode when the \Nmosquito sucks the target's blood."
6618,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But the problem is getting the mosquito \Nto recognize the target...
6619,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Mil...
6620,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"You're a bright boy, but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help."
6621,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, why must Father be this way?"
6622,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Something has come up.
6623,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,So I bid you farewell.
6624,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Please wait!
6625,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,We'll be staying in town for a while.
6626,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Please let Killua know.
6627,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Very well. I shall tell him.
6628,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Goodbye.
6629,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Who are you?
6630,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Killua's friends.
6631,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Friends...
6632,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?
6633,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Come over here!
6634,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Yes, Mother."
6635,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"I probably shouldn't say it, \Nbut these people creep me out..."
6636,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,And I bet they were lying about Killua's \Nsaying that he can't see us.
6637,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Gon, we can't go back yet."
6638,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,How about we tail them?
6639,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Sure, but if we do that, she'll take the blame."
6640,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, right..."
6641,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I will take you to the butler's office.
6642,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,There is a phone that connects to the mansion.
6643,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...
6644,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Zeno-sama?
6645,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Killua-sama's grandfather.
6646,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil.
6647,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I heard that you've made some friends?
6648,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Yeah.
6649,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What sort of people are they?
6650,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What sort of...?
6651,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,They're people I enjoy being with.
6652,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I see.
6653,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,How was the Exam?
6654,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It was easy.
6655,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Kil, come over here."
6656,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Huh?
6657,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I want you to tell me more.
6658,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What did you do during the Exam?
6659,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Who did you meet? How did you feel?
6660,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You can tell me anything...
6661,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Okay.
6662,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I can't believe this.
6663,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Father didn't even ask me first.
6664,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa..."
6665,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I won't forgive them!
6666,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,And guess what Gon said next...
6667,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"He didn't want his legs cut off, but he didn't want to surrender, either!"
6668,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,He's so self-centered.
6669,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Sounds like an interesting boy.
6670,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"And then his opponent pointed a blade at Gon's forehead, \Nbut Gon still..."
6671,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil.
6672,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Huh?
6673,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Do you want to see your friends?
6674,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You don't need to hold back.
6675,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Tell me the truth.
6676,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Thinking back, we've never had a father-son chat before."
6677,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.
6678,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,And I raised you the same way.
6679,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You and I are different.
6680,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I didn't realize that until you left home.
6681,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You are my son.
6682,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But you are your own person.
6683,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Live as you please.
6684,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"If you get tired, you can come home."
6685,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'll ask you one more time.
6686,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Do you want to see your friends?
6687,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Uh-huh.
6688,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I understand.
6689,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,You're free now.
6690,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But...
6691,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Promise me one thing.
6692,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Never betray your friends.
6693,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Understand?
6694,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I promise.
6695,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,I'll never betray them.
6696,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Never.
6697,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil.
6698,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,It's too late. Those three left.
6699,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Return to your cell.
6700,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,No way. I'm leaving.
6701,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil!
6702,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Out of my way.
6703,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Oh, Kil..."
6704,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Your eyes are so cold now...
6705,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,What were you thinking?
6706,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Kil was finally home!
6707,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"For now, we'll let him do what he wants."
6708,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,No! What are you saying?
6709,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,This is a critical juncture in the process of determining if he's qualified \Nto lead the family!
6710,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,So you understand what's at stake.
6711,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!"
6712,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,He'll come home one day.
6713,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Because he is my son.
6714,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Killua has been set free.
6715,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,But Silva declares that Killua \Nwill return as an assassin.
6716,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,"Meanwhile, Gon and his friends \Nhead to the butler's office."
6717,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Will they be able to see Killua?
6718,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!
6719,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Eye for an eye.
6720,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Eye for a tooth?
6721,The x Zoldyck x Family!,24,Tooth for a tooth!
6722,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"In the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokea, is a 3,722 meter-high dormant volcano \Nsurrounded by forest,"
6723,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Kukuroo Mountain.
6724,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The home of the famous Zoldyck \Nfamily of assassins is here.
6725,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Visitors come, every day, \Nhoping for a glimpse of the mansion that no one has ever seen before."
6726,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It is a very popular tourist spot \Nin this nation.
6727,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Lamentation Tours
6728,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I understand.
6729,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You're free now.
6730,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,But...
6731,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Promise me one thing.
6732,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Never betray your friends.
6733,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Understand?
6734,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I promise.
6735,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'll never betray them.
6736,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Never.
6737,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Can't See x If x You're Blind
6738,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"After a discussion with the father he admires,"
6739,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Killua leaves his home again, despite his mother's objections."
6740,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gon and his friends are led by Canary to the butler's office, \Nto attempt to meet with Killua."
6741,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Aren't we there yet?
6742,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,We still have a while to go.
6743,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,How much walking do we have to do...
6744,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Honestly, I cannot believe this!"
6745,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Kil was finally home!
6746,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,But the men allowed him to leave again!
6747,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,And Father is just as guilty!
6748,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,He released Kil without permission!
6749,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Really, this always happens!"
6750,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,They never ask me before they act.
6751,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Do you understand, Gotoh?"
6752,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yes, ma'am."
6753,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...
6754,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Why don't they understand?
6755,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,He's the one child I shall not give up!
6756,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,There it is.
6757,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That building?
6758,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,But it's still pretty far away.
6759,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Say, Canary."
6760,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Won't you get in trouble \Nfor bringing us here?
6761,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,They already know what I'm doing.
6762,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So I am prepared to take the consequences.
6763,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility."
6764,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,No.
6765,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'm merely serving as a guide \Nfor Killua-sama's friends.
6766,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you."
6767,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gotoh, where's Gon now?"
6768,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"You do know, right?"
6769,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Canary is bringing Gon-sama here, along with his two friends."
6770,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Really?
6771,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"They should arrive shortly, \Nso please wait inside."
6772,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay.
6773,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Gotoh.
6774,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yes, sir."
6775,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Let me know the second Gon gets here.
6776,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yes, sir."
6777,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I shall notify you immediately.
6778,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Forgive me, Killua-sama."
6779,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, we finally made it."
6780,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Welcome.
6781,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Please forgive the rude reception.
6782,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The lady of the house has \Nasked us to treat you as official guests.
6783,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Is that better?
6784,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Thanks.
6785,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Then this is not the primary residence?
6786,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"No, this place is for the butlers."
6787,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Well, please make yourselves at home."
6788,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I appreciate the hospitality, but we've come to see Killua."
6789,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Can you take us to him at once?
6790,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That won't be necessary.
6791,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Killua-sama is on his way here.
6792,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Really?
6793,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yes, so please wait a little longer."
6794,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"That's great news, Gon!"
6795,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Yeah!
6796,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Now, then..."
6797,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,To simply sit and wait would be dull.
6798,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"How about a game, to pass the time?"
6799,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,A game?
6800,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Which hand holds the coin?
6801,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The left hand.
6802,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Correct.
6803,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So I'll move more quickly this time.
6804,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Well? Which hand?
6805,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Left again.
6806,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Marvelous.
6807,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Then I shall try harder this time.
6808,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Well? Which hand?
6809,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right."
6810,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You see...
6811,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I have known Killua-sama his entire life.
6812,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I dare say that I care for him \Nas though he were my own.
6813,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"In all honesty,"
6814,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I must despise you for trying \Nto take him away.
6815,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Well? Which hand?
6816,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Answer.
6817,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The left hand.
6818,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,His lady mother could barely speak...
6819,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"She must be heartbroken, \Nhaving to watch him leave."
6820,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I cannot forgive it.
6821,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"By the time Killua-sama arrives, \Na decision will be reached."
6822,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I shall test you in my own way.
6823,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You have no choice.
6824,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Canary!
6825,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"This is her punishment for having \Nbrought you here, against her orders."
6826,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I shall explain the rules.
6827,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If one of you answers incorrectly, \Nthat person is out of the games."
6828,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Should you all be disqualified,"
6829,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.
6830,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,And that he will never see you again.
6831,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Killua is...
6832,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Silence!
6833,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Your lives hang by a thread.
6834,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Now, answer my question."
6835,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Which hand?
6836,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I couldn't see it...
6837,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Don't take too long.
6838,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You have three seconds to answer.
6839,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Hey...
6840,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"After three seconds have passed, \Nslit her throat."
6841,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay.
6842,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Wait! Left hand!
6843,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I pick the right hand!
6844,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Me, too!"
6845,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,One disqualified.
6846,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,This is futile.
6847,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I can't see anything!
6848,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Which hand?
6849,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I choose the right hand.
6850,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I pick the left.
6851,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It was in my left hand.
6852,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Only one remains now.
6853,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Here I go.
6854,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,One second!
6855,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What is it?
6856,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If you're trying to buy time, \NI'll kill one of your friends."
6857,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Leorio, lend me your knife."
6858,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh?
6859,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Don't worry.
6860,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I won't use it for anything stupid.
6861,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That's it...
6862,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling."
6863,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Man, how long do I have to wait?"
6864,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, Gotoh!"
6865,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Anyone around?
6866,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What's going on?
6867,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay!
6868,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Now I can see.
6869,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Give me your best!
6870,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Which hand?
6871,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Left hand.
6872,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Not bad.
6873,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,In that case...
6874,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Who now holds the coin?
6875,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Hunter Vocabulary
6876,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Waiting Time
6877,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The person right behind me.
6878,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Brilliant.
6879,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gotoh, is Gon here yet?"
6880,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Killua!
6881,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Oh! You're here, Gon!"
6882,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Along with...
6883,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Kurapika?
6884,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'm just an afterthought?
6885,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Liorio!
6886,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Leorio!
6887,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It's been a while.
6888,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I can't believe you came. \NWhat happened?
6889,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Your face is a wreck!
6890,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Yours isn't any better!
6891,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, Gotoh."
6892,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I told you to let me know \Nas soon as they arrived.
6893,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What were you doing?
6894,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Forgive me.
6895,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I had them participate in a little game.
6896,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,A game?
6897,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It was nothing more than a poor joke.
6898,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I apologize for any aggravation.
6899,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Did you enjoy yourselves?
6900,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That was really good acting...
6901,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What? Did they try something?
6902,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"No, they were entertaining us."
6903,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Really?
6904,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Well, whatever."
6905,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Anyway, let's go somewhere else. \NAnywhere else, right now."
6906,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If we stay here, my mother \Nwill give us an earful!"
6907,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Yeah!
6908,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, Gotoh."
6909,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Listen up.
6910,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I don't care what Mother says. \NDon't follow me.
6911,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Understood. Please take care.
6912,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gon, let's go."
6913,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Bye.
6914,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Gotoh-san.
6915,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?"
6916,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,No.
6917,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,We butlers feel no emotional attachment to our employers.
6918,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You're lying.
6919,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Gon-kun...
6920,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Well? Which hand?
6921,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Isn't it your left hand?
6922,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What? No way!
6923,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Indeed. It was a deception.
6924,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"In this world, there are many \Nthings that are wrong."
6925,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Please be careful.
6926,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.
6927,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Bye, Canary!"
6928,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Took you long enough, Gon!"
6929,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Sorry about that.
6930,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Let's make ourselves scarce \Nbefore more trouble comes.
6931,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yeah, he's used that trick on me before."
6932,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Once you know the secret, \Nit's so simple, it'll make you mad."
6933,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh? Really?
6934,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'm assuming this was what he did.
6935,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Which hand?
6936,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"It's your left hand, right?"
6937,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh? How?
6938,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, how did you do that?"
6939,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Gotoh held two coins.
6940,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh? But he only had the one.
6941,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand, while flipping the other."
6942,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,And then he let us see him grab \Nthe coin using his left hand.
6943,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"But before he asked us \Nwhich hand held the coin, he raised both arms, and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve."
6944,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That left the coin in his right hand.
6945,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You got it.
6946,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That really makes me mad.
6947,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Well, I'm fairly certain he only used \Nthe trick on the final turn."
6948,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game."
6949,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That's even worse!
6950,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What?
6951,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You're here on a tourist visa?
6952,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Uh-huh.
6953,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?
6954,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You could've just used your Hunter License.
6955,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It lets you stay in other countries \Nfor as long as you want.
6956,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,That's what we said.
6957,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I already decided.
6958,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'm not using the license until I've \Nfinished what I need to do.
6959,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What do you have to do?
6960,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The tag that Hisoka gave me!
6961,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I'll only take it back when you're able to punch me \Nin the face, just like that."
6962,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Until then, I shall leave the tag with you."
6963,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'll return it to Hisoka when \NI punch him in the face!
6964,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License."
6965,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I can't go back to Whale Island, either."
6966,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Hmm...
6967,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"So, where's Hisoka?"
6968,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Uh...
6969,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Thought so...
6970,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I know where he is, Gon."
6971,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh? Really?
6972,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,How?
6973,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,He told me.
6974,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So that's what he said...
6975,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"No, this was after the orientation."
6976,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"But it's still related, right?"
6977,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I suppose so.
6978,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I've been itching to ask...
6979,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What did Hisoka say to you?
6980,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,He told me...
6981,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I have some information for you \Nregarding the spider.
6982,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The Phantom Troupe?
6983,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I do not recall mentioning the \NPhantom Troupe to Hisoka.
6984,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"So either he overheard our conversation \Nduring the first stage, or he heard of it from another."
6985,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol, so those familiar with the organization \Nrefer to the Troupe as such."
6986,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I was interested in his information.
6987,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I see...
6988,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So that's why you swallowed your pride and accepted Hisoka's surrender.
6989,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"After the orientation, I asked him about it."
6990,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I shall await you in Yorknew City, \Non September 1st."
6991,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,September 1st?
6992,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Then you've still got over half a year.
6993,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What's going to happen in Yorknew City?
6994,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,They'll hold the world's largest auction.
6995,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Correct.
6996,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"From September 1st through September 10th, there will be an auction for unusual items, rare goods, and national treasures from around the world."
6997,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The event attracts all manner of nasty folk who come looking to satisfy their greed.
6998,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.
6999,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So the Troupe will be there?
7000,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,They're a group of bandits.
7001,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,They would not let this chance escape.
7002,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"So on that day, Hisoka will be \Nsomewhere in Yorknew City."
7003,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay. September 1st.
7004,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Got it. Thanks.
7005,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Then I shall depart now.
7006,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh?
7007,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"We managed to see Killua again, \Nso I'm finished here."
7008,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'll need money to participate in the auction.
7009,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So I shall search for a patron \Nto employ me as a Hunter.
7010,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Really...
7011,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I guess I should go home, then."
7012,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"You, too?"
7013,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I haven't given up my dream \Nof becoming a doctor.
7014,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If I'm accepted to medical school,"
7015,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.
7016,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'll have to go back and start cramming.
7017,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Uh-huh, good luck."
7018,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Until we meet again.
7019,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yes, that will be..."
7020,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"September 1st, in Yorknew City."
7021,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,See ya.
7022,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Bye-bye!
7023,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,It's just the two of us now.
7024,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Hey, what do you want to do?"
7025,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"You have to ask? We train, obviously."
7026,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Huh? Train for what?
7027,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Shouldn't we have some fun?
7028,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Do you remember what you just said?
7029,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Think you can punch Hisoka in \Nthe face without training?
7030,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"You couldn't land a punch in ten years, let alone six months!"
7031,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay.
7032,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Here, I'll make it easy to understand."
7033,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.
7034,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Uh-huh...
7035,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"If this is the gap between Hisoka \Nand Hanzo, in terms of strength, the gap between Hisoka and you is this far!"
7036,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,And I'm being generous.
7037,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Now I'm mad...
7038,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Then where are you?
7039,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Me?
7040,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Well, probably around here."
7041,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Yep... I'm so humble.
7042,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Oh, Hanzo is stronger?"
7043,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,What is it?
7044,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You really are amazing!
7045,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Cut that out... It's embarrassing.
7046,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I don't know how to tell the \Ndifference in strength between my opponent and myself.
7047,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Stupid. It doesn't matter.
7048,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I'm only estimating.
7049,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You probably have a general idea.
7050,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Once you have enough experience, your guess will become more accurate."
7051,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Besides, the stronger someone is, the better they are at hiding that strength."
7052,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,So you shouldn't rely on this method.
7053,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Oh...
7054,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong."
7055,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Yeah.
7056,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,You won't land a blow on him in six \Nmonths through normal means.
7057,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gon, do you have any money?"
7058,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Actually, I'm running out."
7059,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"I don't have much, either."
7060,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,But there's somewhere we can train and \Nearn money at the same time.
7061,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Train and earn money?
7062,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,The Heavens Arena.
7063,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Heavens Arena...
7064,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Yeah, I'll explain later."
7065,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,We should get moving.
7066,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Okay!
7067,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio, with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,"
7068,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,"Gon and Killua now head to a new stage, \Nthe Heavens Arena."
7069,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Next time: Then x And x After!
7070,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I like sweet and spicy.
7071,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,I like salty and spicy.
7072,Can't See x If x You're Blind!,25,Spicy is good for you!
7073,Then x And x After!,26,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
7074,Then x And x After!,26,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
7075,Then x And x After!,26,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
7076,Then x And x After!,26,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
7077,Then x And x After!,26,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
7078,Then x And x After!,26,They are known...
7079,Then x And x After!,26,...as Hunters!
7080,Then x And x After!,26,Then x And x After
7081,Then x And x After!,26,"""Dear Mito-san and Grandma, \Nhow are you doing?"
7082,Then x And x After!,26,"I'm doing great, as always."
7083,Then x And x After!,26,"So, I actually passed the Hunter Exam."
7084,Then x And x After!,26,"While I managed to pass the exam,"
7085,Then x And x After!,26,I'm not too happy about it.
7086,Then x And x After!,26,"That's because of what happened \Nduring the Final Phase."""
7087,Then x And x After!,26,You really don't get it...
7088,Then x And x After!,26,"If you die, you'll never get another chance."
7089,Then x And x After!,26,"If I kill you here,"
7090,Then x And x After!,26,I need only try again next year.
7091,Then x And x After!,26,We are not on equal footing!
7092,Then x And x After!,26,You value your pride more \Nthan your own life?!
7093,Then x And x After!,26,You're really willing to die for your pride?!
7094,Then x And x After!,26,I'm going to find my dad.
7095,Then x And x After!,26,My dad is a Hunter.
7096,Then x And x After!,26,So I'm going to become a Hunter \Nand find him!
7097,Then x And x After!,26,I believe that I'll find him one day...
7098,Then x And x After!,26,"But I have a feeling that if I give up now,"
7099,Then x And x After!,26,I'll never find him!
7100,Then x And x After!,26,So I won't surrender.
7101,Then x And x After!,26,"If you don't yield, you'll die..."
7102,Then x And x After!,26,He defies reason.
7103,Then x And x After!,26,I give up. You win.
7104,Then x And x After!,26,That's not fair!
7105,Then x And x After!,26,We both have to think of \Na way to settle this fight!
7106,Then x And x After!,26,You fool!
7107,Then x And x After!,26,"""He knocked me out."
7108,Then x And x After!,26,"So Satotz-san had to tell me what had happened next."""
7109,Then x And x After!,26,Begin!
7110,Then x And x After!,26,"It's been too long, Kil."
7111,Then x And x After!,26,Brother...
7112,Then x And x After!,26,You're not cut out to be a Hunter.
7113,Then x And x After!,26,You were born to be... a killer.
7114,Then x And x After!,26,What would you accomplish \Nby becoming a Hunter?
7115,Then x And x After!,26,"True,"
7116,Then x And x After!,26,I don't desire to become a Hunter.
7117,Then x And x After!,26,But...
7118,Then x And x After!,26,I do have something I want...
7119,Then x And x After!,26,You don't.
7120,Then x And x After!,26,I do!
7121,Then x And x After!,26,There's something I really want!
7122,Then x And x After!,26,Tell me what it is that you want.
7123,Then x And x After!,26,I want to become friends with Gon...
7124,Then x And x After!,26,I'm sick of killing people...
7125,Then x And x After!,26,"I want to become friends with Gon, and to live a normal life..."
7126,Then x And x After!,26,That's impossible.
7127,Then x And x After!,26,You'll never be able to make friends.
7128,Then x And x After!,26,Because you have the soul of a killer.
7129,Then x And x After!,26,"If you move an inch, I'll assume \Nthat the fight has begun."
7130,Then x And x After!,26,"And if our bodies make contact, that will also mean the fight has begun."
7131,Then x And x After!,26,"If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die."
7132,Then x And x After!,26,I surrender.
7133,Then x And x After!,26,I lose...

7135,Then x And x After!,26,Apologize to Killua!
7136,Then x And x After!,26,Apologize? For what?
7137,Then x And x After!,26,You don't know what you did wrong?
7138,Then x And x After!,26,Don't bother apologizing.
7139,Then x And x After!,26,Just take me to see Killua.
7140,Then x And x After!,26,What will you do then?
7141,Then x And x After!,26,That should be obvious...
7142,Then x And x After!,26,I'm gonna rescue Killua!
7143,Then x And x After!,26,"""After that, Kurapika, Leorio, and I went to Kukuroo Mountain, \Nwhere Killua lives."""
7144,Then x And x After!,26,This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.
7145,Then x And x After!,26,Anyone who cannot open this gate is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.
7146,Then x And x After!,26,"Listen to me, Gon-kun."
7147,Then x And x After!,26,You three are allowed to work together to open the door.
7148,Then x And x After!,26,"With a little training, it should be possible."
7149,Then x And x After!,26,"Let's do this, Kurapika!"
7150,Then x And x After!,26,"Right, let's push!"
7151,Then x And x After!,26,Here we go!
7152,Then x And x After!,26,One!
7153,Then x And x After!,26,Two!
7154,Then x And x After!,26,Three!
7155,Then x And x After!,26,Ow...
7156,Then x And x After!,26,It opened.
7157,Then x And x After!,26,Yes!
7158,Then x And x After!,26,"We did it, Gon!"
7159,Then x And x After!,26,Uh-huh!
7160,Then x And x After!,26,Leave.
7161,Then x And x After!,26,You're trespassing on private property.
7162,Then x And x After!,26,I cannot allow you to pass \Nwithout permission.
7163,Then x And x After!,26,"If you take one step beyond this line,"
7164,Then x And x After!,26,I'll remove you by force.
7165,Then x And x After!,26,What's the problem?
7166,Then x And x After!,26,I'm just here to see my friend.
7167,Then x And x After!,26,I'm just here to see Killua!
7168,Then x And x After!,26,Why do I have to do this?!
7169,Then x And x After!,26,You're different from Mike.
7170,Then x And x After!,26,"You may try to hide your feelings, but you have a heart."
7171,Then x And x After!,26,"When I mentioned Killua, \Nyour eyes softened for a moment."
7172,Then x And x After!,26,Please...
7173,Then x And x After!,26,Help Killua-sama—
7174,Then x And x After!,26,You must be Gon.
7175,Then x And x After!,26,I heard about you from Illumi.
7176,Then x And x After!,26,Killua knows that you're here.
7177,Then x And x After!,26,Why can't Killua come see us?
7178,Then x And x After!,26,Because he's in solitary confinement.
7179,Then x And x After!,26,Solitary confinement?
7180,Then x And x After!,26,Kil returned because he regretted his actions.
7181,Then x And x After!,26,And he voluntarily entered \Nsolitary confinement.
7182,Then x And x After!,26,I will take you to the butler's office.
7183,Then x And x After!,26,There is a phone that connects to the mansion.
7184,Then x And x After!,26,If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...
7185,Then x And x After!,26,Well? Which hand?
7186,Then x And x After!,26,I have known Killua-sama his entire life.
7187,Then x And x After!,26,I dare say that I care for him \Nas though he were my own.
7188,Then x And x After!,26,"In all honesty,"
7189,Then x And x After!,26,I must despise you for trying \Nto take him away.
7190,Then x And x After!,26,"If one of you answers incorrectly, \Nthat person is out of the games."
7191,Then x And x After!,26,"Should you all be disqualified,"
7192,Then x And x After!,26,I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.
7193,Then x And x After!,26,And that he will never see you again.
7194,Then x And x After!,26,Here I go.
7195,Then x And x After!,26,One second!
7196,Then x And x After!,26,What is it?
7197,Then x And x After!,26,"If you're trying to buy time, \NI'll kill one of your friends."
7198,Then x And x After!,26,That's it...
7199,Then x And x After!,26,"He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling."
7200,Then x And x After!,26,Okay!
7201,Then x And x After!,26,Now I can see.
7202,Then x And x After!,26,Give me your best!
7203,Then x And x After!,26,Who now holds the coin?
7204,Then x And x After!,26,The person right behind me.
7205,Then x And x After!,26,Brilliant.
7206,Then x And x After!,26,"Gotoh, is Gon here yet?"
7207,Then x And x After!,26,Killua!
7208,Then x And x After!,26,"Oh! You're here, Gon!"
7209,Then x And x After!,26,Along with...
7210,Then x And x After!,26,Kurapika?
7211,Then x And x After!,26,I'm just an afterthought?
7212,Then x And x After!,26,Liorio!

7216,Then x And x After!,26,Your face is a wreck!

7222,Then x And x After!,26,"""The business I still need to take care of is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase."""
7223,Then x And x After!,26,I will need you to draw lots.
7224,Then x And x After!,26,Lots?
7225,Then x And x After!,26,For what?
7226,Then x And x After!,26,To determine who will hunt \Nand who will be hunted.
7227,Then x And x After!,26,Listen carefully!
7228,Then x And x After!,26,Your target's ID tag is worth three points.
7229,Then x And x After!,26,Your own ID is also worth three points.
7230,Then x And x After!,26,All other ID tags are worth one point.
7231,Then x And x After!,26,You need six points to advance \Nto the Final Phase.
7232,Then x And x After!,26,"So while on Zevil Island, you must gather enough ID tags \Nto total six points."
7233,Then x And x After!,26,That is the condition for clearing \Nthe Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.
7234,Then x And x After!,26,What number did you draw?
7235,Then x And x After!,26,Show each other our numbers \Nat the same time?

7237,Then x And x After!,26,"Ready, and..."
7238,Then x And x After!,26,#44 is...
7239,Then x And x After!,26,Seriously?
7240,Then x And x After!,26,"In a straight-up fight,"
7241,Then x And x After!,26,I wouldn't stand a chance.
7242,Then x And x After!,26,"But if I only need to steal his ID tag, then I have a real shot."
7243,Then x And x After!,26,Yeah.
7244,Then x And x After!,26,I might actually have a chance.
7245,Then x And x After!,26,That scares me a little...
7246,Then x And x After!,26,But I think it's worth it.
7247,Then x And x After!,26,Now!
7248,Then x And x After!,26,I did it!
7249,Then x And x After!,26,I figured it out!
7250,Then x And x After!,26,I have to aim for my target as \Nhe hunts his own prey!
7251,Then x And x After!,26,There!
7252,Then x And x After!,26,"At this rate, Hisoka will spot him \Nin the next minute."
7253,Then x And x After!,26,I have to figure out where \Ntheir paths will cross...
7254,Then x And x After!,26,Over there!
7255,Then x And x After!,26,I've gotta hurry.
7256,Then x And x After!,26,"Hisoka will attack, as soon as he notices that guy."
7257,Then x And x After!,26,This is my chance to steal his tag...
7258,Then x And x After!,26,My last chance!
7259,Then x And x After!,26,"I have to conceal my presence, too."
7260,Then x And x After!,26,Completely conceal my... presence.

7262,Then x And x After!,26,Hisoka!
7263,Then x And x After!,26,Damn... Bring it!
7264,Then x And x After!,26,I did it...
7265,Then x And x After!,26,I took Hisoka's tag!
7266,Then x And x After!,26,"Approximately, seven thousand."
7267,Then x And x After!,26,Do you know what that \Nnumber represents?
7268,Then x And x After!,26,The number of chances \NI had to kill you.
7269,Then x And x After!,26,It's also the number of times you swung your fishing rod when you were training.
7270,Then x And x After!,26,"Next time, remember to \Nwatch your own back."
7271,Then x And x After!,26,So long.
7272,Then x And x After!,26,Damn it...
7273,Then x And x After!,26,You surprise me.
7274,Then x And x After!,26,"You hid your presence, \Nwhile waiting for your chance?"
7275,Then x And x After!,26,Waiting for me to attack another?
7276,Then x And x After!,26,Did you teach yourself how \Nto conceal your presence?
7277,Then x And x After!,26,Marvelous...
7278,Then x And x After!,26,Like a wild animal.
7279,Then x And x After!,26,And your timing was impeccable.
7280,Then x And x After!,26,You concealed all traces of your attack by timing it with my own attack.
7281,Then x And x After!,26,A splendid job.
7282,Then x And x After!,26,Wait...
7283,Then x And x After!,26,Didn't you come to take back your tag?
7284,Then x And x After!,26,"No, I just came to commend you."
7285,Then x And x After!,26,You owe me one now.
7286,Then x And x After!,26,Feel free to pay me back when you want.
7287,Then x And x After!,26,Goodbye.
7288,Then x And x After!,26,I don't want to owe anyone...
7289,Then x And x After!,26,You can have it back now.
7290,Then x And x After!,26,I refuse.
7291,Then x And x After!,26,"Right now, I'm letting you live."
7292,Then x And x After!,26,"And I'll continue to keep you alive, until you've grown enough \Nto be worth killing..."
7293,Then x And x After!,26,"I'll only take it back when you're able to punch me \Nin the face, just like that."

7295,Then x And x After!,26,"""It's the first time I've ever \Nfelt that frustrated."

7414,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"You made it up here with one match, too."
7415,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That's right.
7416,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,No...
7417,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I still have a long way to go.
7418,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"By the way, which martial arts \Ndiscipline do you practice?"
7419,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.
7420,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"School? We don't have one, right?"
7421,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,No...
7422,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,What?
7423,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You're that strong with no training?
7424,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'm kind of shocked...
7425,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I still have so far to go!

7440,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Well, we want to become stronger."

7443,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Oh?
7444,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled, but you should pay strict attention to your opponent's body, \Nas well as your own."

7450,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"On the 1st floor, win or lose, your reward covers a canned drink."
7451,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"But beyond that, a loss gets you nothing."
7452,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,A win over an opponent in the 50s \Nnets you fifty thousand.
7453,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Fifty thousand...
7454,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That's a lot.
7455,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million."
7456,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,What?
7457,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Once you're past the 150th floor, you get ten million a pop."
7458,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Ten million?
7459,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Didn't you make it to floor 200 \Nwhen you were here before?
7460,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Th-The 200th floor?
7461,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,How much do you get for \Nwinning on the 200th floor?
7462,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Well... I don't really know, because I quit once I reached 200."
7463,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"But when I was winning in the 190s,"
7464,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"I had around two hundred million, total."
7465,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,T-Two hundred million...
7466,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Where's that money now?
7467,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That was four years ago.
7468,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Of course it's gone now.
7469,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Spent it all on snacks!
7470,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?"
7471,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,What kind of snacks are these?
7472,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Hey, let's head to the waiting room."
7473,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"We didn't take any damage in the last fight, so they'll probably assign us \Nanother match today."
7474,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Well, these opponents should be a cinch."
7475,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Just take it easy.
7476,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Really?
7477,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua-san!
7478,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You're too loud...
7479,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"#2054, Killua-sama."
7480,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'm already up.
7481,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"And #1963, Zushi-sama."
7482,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,What?
7483,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor."
7484,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Oh.
7485,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Osu! I shall give it my best.
7486,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Sure. Well, you can't win them all."
7487,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Better luck next time.
7488,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'll head out.
7489,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Yeah. Good luck, guys."
7490,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'll wait for you above.
7491,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Uh-huh...
7492,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He really didn't have to be so blunt...
7493,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Okay, everyone!"
7494,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,The event you've all been waiting for!
7495,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,We have a unique match-up for you!
7496,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Two young boys, fighting it out!"
7497,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"However, you don't want to \Nunderestimate them!"
7498,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Both had strong showings \Nin their first rounds!
7499,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,They both advanced directly to the 50s!
7500,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,We will now replay their matches on the big screen!
7501,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!
7502,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,One chop was all it took to knock him out!
7503,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts to punish his opponent, scoring a flawless knockout \Nof a 200-plus kilogram giant!"
7504,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Okay, everyone!"
7505,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Are you ready to press \Nyour gamble switches?
7506,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"In that case, switch on!"
7507,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!"
7508,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Perhaps his martial arts \Nknowledge gives him an edge?
7509,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,This is bad...{\i0
7510,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua-san is mad...{\i0
7511,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"This match will consist of three, \Nthree-minute rounds, decided by the points and knockout system!"
7512,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Begin!
7513,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I see.
7514,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,His stance leaves few openings.
7515,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He's trained long and hard \Nto master that stance.
7516,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But he has no chance against me.
7517,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Wow... Killua is boldly walking toward his opponent!
7518,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Sorry.
7519,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But I'm sticking to one chop per \Nmatch until I reach the 150s.
7520,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Clean hit!
7521,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Amazing!
7522,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua has knocked out another\Nopponent with only a single chop!
7523,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,A clean hit and a knockdown \Nget him 2 points.
7524,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"As you already know, under the \Npoints and knockout system, there are clean hits, critical hits,\N and knockdowns."
7525,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Superb attacks count as ""clean hits,""\Nworth one point apiece."
7526,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Unusually superb attacks are classified as ""critical hits,"" \Nworth two points."
7527,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Knocking down your opponent \Nearns you one point.
7528,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"After amassing ten points, you are \Nawarded a technical knockout."
7529,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Of course, if your opponent cannot \Ncontinue to fight after one hit, you win due to a knockout!"
7530,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"That chop ended the fight, stupid."
7531,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Can you fight?
7532,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Yes, I'm okay!"
7533,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He got up!
7534,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Zushi will continue!
7535,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Fight!
7536,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Did I hold back too much?
7537,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He's taken another hit!
7538,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Zushi has been knocked down!
7539,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But he's already standing up!
7540,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"If you stand before the referee reaches you, your opponent isn't awarded the point."
7541,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Tsk. Not bad.
7542,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,So the same attack won't \Nwork twice against you.
7543,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But something's wrong.
7544,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That attack was strong enough that a graze should have rendered him unconscious.
7545,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Unbelievable...
7546,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He has dominating power and speed!
7547,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"At this rate, I won't stand a chance!"
7548,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I have to... try it!
7549,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Oh! What's happening?
7550,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua has backed away!
7551,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Zushi!
7552,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator interrupted the fight, but let's get started again!"
7553,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Oh, Killua!"
7554,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Over here!
7555,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,See? I got sixty thousand.
7556,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,How about you?
7557,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,It took you a while to get here.
7558,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Yeah, I ran into a little trouble."
7559,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Then Zushi was pretty strong.
7560,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"No, not at all."
7561,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He has potential.
7562,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"One day, he'll be strong."
7563,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"But right now, he's just target practice for me."
7564,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,His punches were weak...
7565,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I was completely able to knock him around.
7566,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But I couldn't defeat him.
7567,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Huh?
7568,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"I received the TKO from points, but I couldn't knock him out."
7569,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Further...
7570,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"When he changed his stance, his aura reminded me of my brother's."
7571,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"I don't know what it was, \Nbut it felt dangerous."
7572,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,It must be some kind of technique.
7573,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"His master called it ""Ren."""
7574,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Forgive me, Master!"
7575,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"I thought I made myself clear, Zushi."
7576,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You were not supposed to use Ren yet.
7577,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Forgive me!
7578,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"My opponent was so strong,"
7579,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I couldn't help myself...
7580,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Sure. Wanting to win is good.
7581,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But your true goal lies beyond this.
7582,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,At this tower's top floor.
7583,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Focus too much on simply winning a fight, and you reduce your own potential."
7584,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Osu!
7585,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You must be prepared to lose a \Nthousand times while you're here.
7586,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Osu!
7587,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,So he isn't supposed to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?
7588,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"The strongest fighters are at the top, right?"
7589,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Gon, change in plans."
7590,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Huh?
7591,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'm aiming to reach the top floor!
7592,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Uh-huh!
7593,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Actually, that was my goal all along.{\i0"
7594,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua defeats another opponent \Nwith one chop!
7595,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,A knockout!
7596,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Oh! In the other arena,"
7597,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Gon has knocked out another opponent with a single push!
7598,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Each of them has won six \Nconsecutive matches over the past three days, to reach the 100s without a scratch!"
7599,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua's chop.
7600,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,And Gon's push.
7601,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,How far will they be able to go?
7602,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,And who is going to be able to stop them?
7603,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Yay! A private room!
7604,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,We won't have to worry about \Nmoney and lodging anymore.
7605,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I wouldn't be too sure about that.
7606,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"If you drop below the 100s, you have to \Ncheck out of this room."
7607,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,A world of difference separates making it to the 100s and staying in the 100s.
7608,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,The 100th floor is like a ceiling.
7609,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,A ceiling?
7610,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Once you pass it, you get special treatment."
7611,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,So everyone focuses on holding their spot.
7612,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Some people will do anything it takes to stay in the 100s.
7613,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You can waste a lot of time on them.
7614,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Be careful, Gon."
7615,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Yeah.
7616,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Gon wins another match \Nwith a single push!
7617,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Guess I didn't need to worry about him.
7618,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Your prize money has been deposited \Ninto the specified account.
7619,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,You were right...
7620,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I've never seen so many zeros before...
7621,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"And just a week ago, I was totally broke."
7622,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'm a little annoyed.
7623,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Huh?
7624,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"My first time here, it took me two months to reach floor 150."
7625,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Meanwhile, you're breezing through."
7626,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But you were only six back then.
7627,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Well, that's true..."
7628,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Oh, that's right."
7629,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I saw Zushi on TV earlier.
7630,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,So did I.
7631,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He's still in the 50s.
7632,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I wonder what that Ren you sensed could have been.
7633,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...
7634,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?
7635,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Ren is one of the four major principles.
7636,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,The four major principles for \Ndisciplining your mind and body.
7637,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Fundamental to every martial art!
7638,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"You must know ""Ten,"" learn ""Zetsu,"" achieve ""Ren,"" and reach ""Hatsu""!"
7639,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"This is all part of ""Nen"" training!"
7640,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That covers everything!
7641,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I've no idea what you just said!
7642,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Zushi...
7643,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Are you sufficiently educated \Nthat you can teach others?
7644,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Gon-kun, Killua-kun."
7645,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"There's an old saying that if you learn something piecemeal, you'll end up knowing less \Nthan when you started."
7646,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?
7647,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But I want to know right now.
7648,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Because it's related to the secret \Nbehind my brother's power.
7649,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Then, your brother is able to use Nen?"
7650,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I need to know what Nen \Nand Ren even mean!
7651,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I'll agree to the full learning process \Nrather than a quick explanation!
7652,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"And if you're willing to teach me,"
7653,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I won't try to figure it out myself.
7654,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,I understand.
7655,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Come with me to my residence.
7656,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,What is Nen? What is Ren?
7657,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Killua believes they are related \Nto his brother's abilities.
7658,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,"Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well."
7659,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Brush your teeth. \NUnripe Fruit

7668,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He practices Shingen-ryu kung fu.
7669,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He's considered a one in a hundred thousand talent!
7670,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Very polite and earnest.
7671,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,But we're considered one in a hundred million talents!
7672,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,He talks in a loud voice.
7673,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Osu!
7674,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Next time: Nen x And x Nen!
7675,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,That was a rough episode...
7676,Arrival x At The x Arena!,27,Good work!

7682,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"After reaching the 200th floor, you receive the right to challenge \Nthe strongest fighters, the Floor Masters, in an intense \Nbattle of survival."
7683,Nen x And x Nen!,28,This is the best stage a warrior could ask for.
7684,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Then, your brother is able to use Nen?"
7685,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I need to know what Nen \Nand Ren even mean!
7686,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I'll agree to the full learning process rather than a quick explanation!
7687,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I understand.

7689,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"After Killua fought Zushi, the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,"
7690,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zushi mentioned the four major principles.
7691,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing."
7692,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Do I have your attention?
7693,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen means to burn your own soul.
7694,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"In other words, it tests your strength of will."
7695,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Burn
7696,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen
7697,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And the four major principles are part of a training curriculum for \Nstrengthening your will.
7698,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Strengthening your will?
7699,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Training?
7700,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That's correct.
7701,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ten
7702,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Focus
7703,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Ten means to focus your soul to a single point, to increase awareness of your ego and goals."
7704,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Express
7705,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu
7706,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu means to express yourself in words.
7707,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Temper
7708,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ren
7709,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ren means to temper that will.
7710,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Act
7711,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hatsu
7712,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And Hatsu means to act upon that will.

7714,Nen x And x Nen!,28,\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\NFocus \N\NExpress \N\NTemper \N\NAct
7715,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ten.
7716,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu.
7717,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ren.
7718,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hatsu.
7719,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Those are the four major principles.
7720,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his ""refusal \Nto lose,"" during his fight with you."
7721,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"So, allow me to demonstrate."
7722,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Killua-kun...
7723,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I think I'm going to kill you now.
7724,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Are you ready?
7725,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yeah, sure."
7726,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's not happening.
7727,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Then I'll take this step-by-step.
7728,Nen x And x Nen!,28,First comes Ten.
7729,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I focus my soul into a single point.
7730,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu.
7731,Nen x And x Nen!,28,You can express yourself mentally or verbally.
7732,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I will kill you.
7733,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That was Ren.
7734,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If I temper my will enough, then I can act. Hatsu."
7735,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If your will is strong enough, you can make your opponent back down, \Nwithout moving a muscle."
7736,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The concept of bluffing derives from this.
7737,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Ren hardens that which is soft, and you lose the ability to \Ncorrect an incorrect idea."
7738,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Therefore, you should avoid using Ren until your soul has fully matured."
7739,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Right now, you boys and Zushi \Nshould be training your souls."
7740,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Let's go, Gon."
7741,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If you wish to learn about Nen, you should focus on mastering Ten."
7742,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If you master Ten, you will no longer feel the pressure \Nof an opponent's will."
7743,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Thank you very much!
7744,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Wait up, Killua!"
7745,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zushi.
7746,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yes, sir."
7747,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Let's begin training.
7748,Nen x And x Nen!,28,O-Osu!
7749,Nen x And x Nen!,28,First...
7750,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He was lying?
7751,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense, and Wing is clearly very strong."
7752,Nen x And x Nen!,28,But his story had holes.
7753,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Huh?
7754,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zushi's toughness.
7755,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He kept getting up after \NI knocked him down.
7756,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"I was getting irritated, so I used all of my strength \Nduring my last attack."
7757,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Brat!
7758,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Crap!
7759,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He flew out of the ring!
7760,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Even an amateur can see that \Nhe's headed for the hospital!
7761,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Oh! He stood back up.
7762,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zushi must be invincible.
7763,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Impossible.
7764,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"However, the referee has awarded \Na critical hit and knockdown."
7765,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points."
7766,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Willpower didn't keep him standing.
7767,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He's hiding some other secret.
7768,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"What's wrong, Zushi?"
7769,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Your Ten is unstable.
7770,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Master...
7771,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hmm?
7772,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Why did you lie to them?
7773,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Lie?
7774,Nen x And x Nen!,28,You mean my explanation?
7775,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Yes!
7776,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"The four major principles are \NTen, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu."
7777,Nen x And x Nen!,28,But they don't mean what you said.
7778,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Did you lie because they aren't your students?
7779,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I didn't lie.
7780,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7781,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Force
7782,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0 to someone who is not a student.
7783,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"So I used the other Nen as a hint, \Nto help them along."
7784,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0 it can become a terrible weapon.
7785,Nen x And x Nen!,28,For example...
7786,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"You could turn a piece of paper \Ninto a blade to harm others, while hardening your body, \Nas a defensive measure."
7787,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7788,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That is why you must be careful when \Ndeciding to teach it.
7789,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Master...
7790,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I didn't have a chance to read that book yet...
7791,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And that can of juice was mine...
7792,Nen x And x Nen!,28,S-Sorry...
7793,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's time for the day's biggest match!
7794,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.
7795,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Will they be able to keep moving on?
7796,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Okay, everyone..."
7797,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Get ready to press your gamble switches!
7798,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me."
7799,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That's because
7800,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"I am as slippery as a snake, with sharp fangs,\Nto bite at your vital points."
7801,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"You may sport a vicious chop, but you can't overcome these muscles!"
7802,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That's because...
7803,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I'm totally ripped!
7804,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Begin!
7805,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Critical hit and knockdown...
7806,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Three points.
7807,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Knockout!
7808,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The winner is Gon!
7809,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Critical hit and knockdown...
7810,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Three points.
7811,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Knockout!
7812,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The winner is Killua!
7813,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked \Nout their opponents with one attack."
7814,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And both of them have \Nsuccessfully cleared the 190s!
7815,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Both have advanced to the 200s!
7816,Nen x And x Nen!,28,They've already reached the 200s?!
7817,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zushi.
7818,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Master!
7819,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Killua-kun and Gon-kun have \Nalready reached the 200s?
7820,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yes, they're amazing!"
7821,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I need to train more...
7822,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Huh?
7823,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Master?
7824,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I have no choice.
7825,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Enjoy.
7826,Nen x And x Nen!,28,What's the 200th floor like?
7827,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Beats me.
7828,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I've never been up here before.
7829,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Wow!
7830,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The 200th floor is so fancy!
7831,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Where's the receptionist?
7832,Nen x And x Nen!,28,This way?
7833,Nen x And x Nen!,28,We finally made it.
7834,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Yeah.
7835,Nen x And x Nen!,28,What is this?
7836,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"All of a sudden, it feels like \Nwe're in a monster-filled jungle."
7837,Nen x And x Nen!,28,But this is an ordinary hallway.
7838,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Let's go.
7839,Nen x And x Nen!,28,We can do this!
7840,Nen x And x Nen!,28,This isn't working...
7841,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I can't move forward!
7842,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I don't want to move forward...
7843,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"This is murderous intent, aimed at us."
7844,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hey! Who's there?
7845,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Show yourself!
7846,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?"
7847,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"The receptionist's desk is over here, so please register for a 200s match today."
7848,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"You won't be able to register after midnight, so please be careful."
7849,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Was she the source of all that?
7850,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I can't tell.
7851,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"By the way, there are currently one hundred, seventy-three \Ncontestants in the 200s class."
7852,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"And starting from the 200s, all weapons are allowed in matches."
7853,Nen x And x Nen!,28,So please use whatever you have.
7854,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Also, you will no longer receive \Nprize money in the 200s class."
7855,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"You will fight only for glory, so please understand that\N if you're going to participate."
7856,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Huh?!
7857,Nen x And x Nen!,28,H-Hisoka...
7858,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Why are you here?
7859,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's hardly that strange.
7860,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"I love to fight, and this is a temple to fighting."
7861,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And why are you here?
7862,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Just kidding...
7863,Nen x And x Nen!,28,This was no coincidence.
7864,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I've been waiting for you.
7865,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Remember how you ordered airship \Ntickets over the cybernet?
7866,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"With a little effort, it's possible to determine where \Nand when someone will arrive."
7867,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Well,"
7868,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I knew you would come here eventually.
7869,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"And so, as a veteran, I have a warning for you."
7870,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's still too early for you boys to step on this floor.
7871,Nen x And x Nen!,28,How early depends on your efforts.
7872,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Leave for now.
7873,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's too early right now.
7874,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That's stupid!
7875,Nen x And x Nen!,28,We just got up here...
7876,Nen x And x Nen!,28,I won't let you pass.
7877,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Not that you could, anyway."
7878,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Wh-What is...
7879,Nen x And x Nen!,28,...this?
7880,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Don't be reckless!
7881,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Wing-san!
7882,Nen x And x Nen!,28,You have no defense
7883,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7884,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen?
7885,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Right now, you are like someone standing naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold."
7886,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If you continue to strain \Nyour body, you may die."
7887,Nen x And x Nen!,28,This is Nen?!
7888,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He can stop us from moving \Nforward through willpower?
7889,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Don't lie!
7890,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yes, I was lying."
7891,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Though technically, I wasn't lying completely."
7892,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7893,Nen x And x Nen!,28,So retreat for now.
7894,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Hey, receptionist lady."
7895,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Oh, yes?"
7896,Nen x And x Nen!,28,What happens if we don't register \Nfor a fight today?
7897,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Gon-sama, you would have to \Nstart again, from the first floor."
7898,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"However, Killua-sama refused to register once before."
7899,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"So if he fails to register again, his commitment will be questioned, and he will be banned from participating."
7900,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Hey, Wing-san."
7901,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If we back down now, will we be able to return here by midnight?"
7902,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That depends on you.
7903,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Simply put,"
7904,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7905,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Nen{\i0 to manipulate your aura,"
7906,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Force
7907,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen also known as life energy.
7908,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Every person possesses a \Nsmall amount of life energy.
7909,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"But in most cases, it's simply discharged."
7910,Nen x And x Nen!,28,The ability to build up
7911,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ten{\i0
7912,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Shroud
7913,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"You can make your body harder,"
7914,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Shroud
7915,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ten and considerably slow the effects of aging.
7916,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu{\i0
7917,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Null
7918,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Zetsu
7919,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"As you may guess, this nullifies your aura."
7920,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"It is effective for concealing your presence, \Nand recovering from extreme fatigue."
7921,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ren{\i0
7922,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Enhance
7923,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ren
7924,Nen x And x Nen!,28,A technique to create an especially strong aura.
7925,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Can you feel that?
7926,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Yeah, I can feel the pressure."
7927,Nen x And x Nen!,28,But it doesn't feel dangerous.
7928,Nen x And x Nen!,28,That's because I have no hostile intent.
7929,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"However, I must admit I am \Nimpressed by their senses."
7930,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Perhaps it's because of \Nhow they've grown up.
7931,Nen x And x Nen!,28,But their natural potential is \Nalso a major factor.
7932,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Aura is an energy that comes \Nfrom within humans.
7933,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Which makes it very effective \Nagainst other humans.
7934,Nen x And x Nen!,28,For better or worse.
7935,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent, you can use aura to kill."
7936,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Only one thing can protect you
7937,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7938,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7939,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Ten{\i0
7940,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Block the other person's aura with your own.
7941,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Otherwise...
7942,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Your body will be crushed.
7943,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hisoka blocks the path leading \Nbeyond the 200th floor.
7944,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Will Gon and Killua be able to learn enough about
7945,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Nen {\i0 and reach the receptionist, \Nbefore the clock strikes midnight?"
7946,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's too early.
7947,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
7948,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hunterpedia!
7949,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
7950,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
7951,Nen x And x Nen!,28,It's Gon and Killua's
7952,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Hunterpedia!
7953,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
7954,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Today, we introduce Wing-san!"
7955,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Master of Shingen-ryu. \NZushi's teacher.
7956,Nen x And x Nen!,28,He's Zushi's teacher!
7957,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And a master of Shingen-ryu!
7958,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0
7959,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Nen{\i0 but sloppy about everything else.
7960,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Oh, Wing-san's shirt isn't tucked in."
7961,Nen x And x Nen!,28,And his hair's a mess!
7962,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Next time: Awakening x And x Potential!
7963,Nen x And x Nen!,28,Did you feel anything?
7964,Nen x And x Nen!,28,"Nope, nothing."
7965,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Heavens Arena.
7966,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"The 251-story, 991-meter \Nbuilding is a mecca for fighters."
7967,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"When combatants win a fight, they may advance by one class, and receive a corresponding reward."
7968,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"After reaching the 100th floor, you are assigned a private room."
7969,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"After reaching the 200th floor, you receive the right to challenge \Nthe strongest fighters, the Floor Masters, in an intense \Nbattle of survival."
7970,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,This is the best stage a warrior could ask for.
7971,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Only one thing can protect you
7972,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
7973,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
7974,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
7975,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Otherwise...
7976,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Your body will be crushed.
7977,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Awakening x And x Potential
7978,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"As the hour grows late,"
7979,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Wing's lecture has reached its climax.
7980,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,But they only have until midnight.
7981,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Before that time,"
7982,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
7983,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
7984,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, at present, only a few are capable of using that power."
7985,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Thus, they are treated as \Ngeniuses, leaders, psychics, mystics, or superhumans."
7986,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,A power that dwells within everyone...
7987,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Yes.
7988,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,And there are two means by which to awaken this power.
7989,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,The deliberate way and the aggressive way.
7990,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Zushi underwent the deliberate method.
7991,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"He was a quick learner, and he trained hard."
7992,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
7993,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,In about six months.
7994,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's too long...
7995,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
7996,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
7997,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.
7998,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Will it be fast enough?
7999,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That will depend on you.
8000,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Can you learn to hold your aura within \Nyour body, before time runs out?"
8001,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That is the key.
8002,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I will now direct my aura toward you.
8003,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Hatsu{\i0
8004,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Naturally, I will restrain myself, \Nsince my objective is not to destroy your bodies."
8005,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, this way is still perilous."
8006,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"In other words, I will attempt \Nto shock you into awakening."
8007,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"I will give your sleeping body a jolt,"
8008,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
8009,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"I say that your body sleeps because your body's openings, \Nor micropyles, are closed, meaning that your aura flow is stunted."
8010,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Therefore,"
8011,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"I will send my aura into your bodies, to open your micropyles."
8012,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"[Micropyles]\NNumerous pores in the body, \Nwhich release aura."
8013,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Under normal circumstances, you would spend a long time meditating and discovering your own auras, while slowly opening those apertures."
8014,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Even Zushi, a natural talent, \Nrequired three months."
8015,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, you two could do it in a week."
8016,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Or even sooner.
8017,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Which is why I find it unfortunate that we have such little time to work with.
8018,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I don't really get it...
8019,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,But quick and dirty is always better.
8020,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"This is a shady, highly frowned upon method."
8021,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You will be ignoring the correct procedure.
8022,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"You could even die, if the person using this method \Nwere weak or evil."
8023,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil."
8024,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Right?
8025,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's why I want to know...
8026,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Shroud   Force \NNull \NAct
8027,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Why would you suddenly decide to teach us the \Ntrue four major principles?
8028,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Because I did not want to \Nsquander this opportunity.
8029,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If you were to challenge the 200s, with none of this knowledge, \Nyou would suffer greatly."
8030,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8031,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,And they have a special \Ngreeting for any newcomer
8032,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8033,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8034,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"In other words, they do what I am about to, but without restraint."
8035,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"They don't care, even if people die..."
8036,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Only those who survive \Nare allowed to pass.
8037,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,They are the chosen.
8038,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, they pay a steep price."
8039,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's why I wanted you to be prepared.
8040,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Now, despite my attempts to scare you,"
8041,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I have confidence that this \Nwill awaken your power!
8042,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You have the potential.
8043,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,As well as the ability.
8044,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Put your belongings down, \Ntake off your shirt, and turn your backs toward me."
8045,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It's so hot!
8046,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"And I can feel pressure, even though \NWing-san isn't touching me."
8047,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,This is it! That sensation...
8048,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Like something invisible and slimy, \Ncrawling across my skin."
8049,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Amplify this by millions of times,"
8050,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8051,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I'll begin.
8052,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.
8053,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Th-This is...
8054,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"That is your aura, or life energy."
8055,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"You can see it now, because the micropyles in your \Neyes were also opened."
8056,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It's like smoke.
8057,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle."
8058,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It's rushing out from every part of my body.
8059,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It won't stop gushing out.
8060,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Isn't that dangerous?
8061,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"This is your life energy, so if it continues to escape, \Nyou will grow tired."
8062,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If you expend all your aura, you will collapse from fatigue."
8063,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Really?
8064,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Listen to me.
8065,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You must concentrate on keeping \Nyour aura within your body.
8066,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Close your eyes!
8067,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Use any stance that helps you to focus.
8068,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Then visualize your aura flowing \Nlike blood through your body.
8069,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"From the top of your head, \Nto your right shoulder."
8070,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"To your hand, before passing through\N your legs, to the left side."
8071,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,And now visualize that flow \Nbeginning to ebb and hovering around your body.
8072,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,These boys are incredible.
8073,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance would be the most effective.
8074,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"With minimal advice, they've already \Nmastered the technique."
8075,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Magnificent...
8076,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,And terrifying.
8077,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Slowly open your eyes.
8078,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,How do you feel?
8079,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I feel like I'm surrounded by some \Nkind of warm mucus.
8080,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes."
8081,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Continue to maintain those images.
8082,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
8083,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8084,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Previously, it would have been painful for you to stand within this."
8085,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Yeah,"
8086,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I understand your blizzard analogy now.
8087,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0 you'll be able to break through his barrier!
8088,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Here I come!
8089,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Welcome to the 200s.
8090,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It appears that I needn't bother \Nwith the traditional greeting.
8091,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I can guess why you've come \Nto Heavens Arena.
8092,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You intended to train before challenging me...
8093,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here."
8094,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That saves me time.
8095,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten{\i0
8096,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8097,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"To be honest, at present, I feel no urge to fight you."
8098,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,However...
8099,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If you manage to win a single \Nmatch in the 200s,"
8100,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I shall accept your challenge.
8101,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Let's go.
8102,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Yeah.
8103,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Newcomers?
8104,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Looks like it.
8105,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Seems that they can use it.
8106,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Indeed...
8107,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Welcome to the 200s!
8108,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Please fill out the forms here.
8109,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Would you like to register for a match now?
8110,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"In this class, there is a self-service system by which you're permitted \Nninety days of preparation."
8111,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You may choose to fight on \Nany day during that time.
8112,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Of course, you're free to fight every day, and you can also wait until \Nthe very last day to fight."
8113,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Once you've participated in a fight, you have another ninety days to prepare."
8114,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, if you don't fight before \Nthose ninety days end, you will be disqualified, and your name will be struck from all records."
8115,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Does that mean we'll be fighting \Nin this class multiple times?
8116,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Yes, you need ten wins to clear this floor."
8117,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"However, if you lose four times before ten wins, you'll be disqualified."
8118,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"And if you win ten times, you have a chance to challenge \Nthe Floor Masters!"
8119,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,The Floor Masters are the twenty-one \Nstrongest fighters here.
8120,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Each claims one of the floors, from 230 to 250."
8121,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Do you understand now?
8122,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If you defeat a Floor Master, you become the new master of that floor!"
8123,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Th-That's not all!
8124,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If you become a Floor Master, you earn the right to participate in the biennial celebration of \Ncombat, Battle Olympia!"
8125,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,No reaction?
8126,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Forget that.
8127,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Is there anything special about the top floor?
8128,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's what you want to know?!
8129,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,The champion of Battle Olympia gets to live on the top floor!
8130,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It's an incredible honor.
8131,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground..."
8132,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Don't you get it?!
8133,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"But Killua's house is 3,700 meters \Nabove ground, right?"
8134,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,A-And the champion always \Nreceives a prize of...
8135,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"What do you wanna do, Gon?"
8136,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Now that I know the top floor's secret,"
8137,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I don't care anymore.
8138,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.
8139,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Why are you kids even here?
8140,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Well, then you'll need to win a fight."
8141,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?"
8142,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,No...
8143,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I'm doing this!
8144,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I have to find out how different \Nthese opponents are.
8145,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"I'll need you to fill out this form, as well."
8146,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Okay!
8147,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You want something?
8148,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"No, not really."
8149,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,We're simply in line to register for a fight.
8150,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Oh, I get it."
8151,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Gon, these guys want to fight \Non the day you do."
8152,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I'm ready to go whenever.
8153,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,There you go.
8154,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,This boy has plenty of spunk.
8155,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.
8156,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Killua-sama will be in room 2223.
8157,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,We will let you know which day your match is.
8158,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Thanks!
8159,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,They must have gone through that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.
8160,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"If we'd gone in blind, we could've ended up like them."
8161,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Wow! This room is huge!
8162,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Hey, are you listening to me?"
8163,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,The bath is squeaky clean.
8164,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!
8165,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Look, Killua..."
8166,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Hey, Gon!"
8167,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Your battle has been set \Nfor 3 PM, March 11th!!"
8168,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,What? Tomorrow?!
8169,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's fast.
8170,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.
8171,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,But that's okay.
8172,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I need the experience.
8173,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,I need to discover what I \Ncan do with this power.
8174,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today."
8175,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"First, we have Gon, who managed to zip straight to this class!"
8176,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"His opponent will be Gido, who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record."
8177,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun."
8178,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Ten is a purely defensive technique.
8179,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,You have not improved \Nyour offensive capabilities.
8180,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Plus, you will still take damage \Nfrom physical attacks."
8181,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"A highly skilled Nen opponent will be able to penetrate your Ten, and deal a lethal blow."
8182,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,So you should wait two months \Nbefore you start fighting.
8183,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"During that time, I will \Nteach you as much as I can."
8184,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Sorry, Wing-san."
8185,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,But I'm itching to fight right now!
8186,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Good grief.
8187,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That boy is a real handful...
8188,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,And...
8189,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Begin!
8190,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Dancing Tops
8191,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!"
8192,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,He uses numerous tops to \Nattack his opponent!
8193,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Here we go...
8194,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Battle Waltz!
8195,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Clean hit!
8196,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit and one point, right off the bat!"
8197,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,He's off to a rough start.
8198,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Damn!
8199,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Nen{\i0 to keep these tops spinning \Nfor hours, as my attack."
8200,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"The attack pattern is so complex, even I don't know what will come next!"
8201,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Tops spinning into each other \Nand attacking me...
8202,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That small top deals damage \Nequivalent to a hammer!
8203,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8204,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,The 200s class is nothing like he expected.
8205,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Can Gon survive this predicament?
8206,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Or not?
8207,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Coming up, we have Gon"
8208,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
8209,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit and Killua's
8210,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Hunterpedia!
8211,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
8212,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,It's Gon and Killua's
8213,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Hunterpedia!
8214,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
8215,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"Today, we introduce Gido!"
8216,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,A Heavens Arena 200s-class \Nfighter who is Gon's first \Nopponent.
8217,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Nen{\i0
8218,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"He may even turn himself into one, and spin into you!"
8219,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,"An enhancer, who plays \Nwhile he fights."
8220,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Spin round and round...
8221,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Next time: Fierce x And x Ferocious!
8222,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,Don't be too reckless.
8223,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,A real friend would support \Nmy reckless behavior.
8224,Awakening x And x Potential!,29,That's just reckless.

8244,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Sorry, Wing-san."
8245,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But I'm itching to fight right now!
8246,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Fierce x And x Ferocious
8247,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Gon is in his first 200s match, but he's been caught off guard \Nby the unexpected nature of his opponent's attack."
8248,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He's been hit from behind by another top!
8249,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Gon is in big trouble, after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!"
8250,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Clean hit and knockdown!
8251,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Two points!
8252,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gido has already earned four points!
8253,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Can you continue?
8254,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You bet!
8255,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There are too many tops for me to track.
8256,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Damn...
8257,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What should I do?
8258,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,M-Master...
8259,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8260,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Hatsu{\i0
8261,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He's projecting his aura into the tops.
8262,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,That allows the tops to move with more strength and \Nspeed than normally possible.
8263,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Manipulating a small object requires \Nonly a small amount of aura.
8264,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,A large object requires a \Nlarger amount of aura.
8265,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8266,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Those tops couldn't be so strong were he simply using his aura to spin them.
8267,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It can only be accomplished because he cares deeply about his tops.
8268,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Objects respond well to those who are compatible.
8269,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I can't follow them with my eyes.
8270,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i1
8271,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I can sense it.
8272,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Yeah, I can sense them."
8273,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Ten{\i1
8274,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Another direct hit!
8275,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon is completely helpless!
8276,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He's been knocked out of the ring!
8277,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The score is now 6-0!
8278,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He's dug himself a big hole!
8279,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It won't work...
8280,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If I focus on sensing the tops,"
8281,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Ten{\i1
8282,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What should I do?
8283,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,A top was knocked outside the ring?
8284,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But it isn't attacking me...
8285,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?
8286,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.
8287,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If you're not in the ring within a ten-count, \NI'll rule you the loser!"
8288,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,One!
8289,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Now that I think about it,"
8290,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i1
8291,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What about the others?
8292,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"They're spinning around, \Nbumping into each other."
8293,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?
8294,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Four!
8295,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Why are you standing outside the ring?
8296,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!"
8297,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Five!
8298,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Just as I thought...
8299,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,This is like a game of sumo tops!
8300,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It's impossible to command tops \Nto move with precision.
8301,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It's likely Gido simply commands the tops to strike anything in their way.
8302,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"They spin around, striking whatever happens to cross their paths."
8303,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Seven!
8304,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"In that case, I don't need to fear the tops."
8305,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"I can ignore the tops, and attack him!"
8306,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Heh, you may have figured out my tops, but you still can't land an attack!"
8307,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There it is!
8308,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Gido's special technique, \Ncombining offense and defense!"
8309,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Tornado Top!
8310,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Tornado Top
8311,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He lands a strong counter on Gon!
8312,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Three points!
8313,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The judge has awarded a \Ncritical hit and knockdown!
8314,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gido has nine points!
8315,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon is on the verge of losing!
8316,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"I turn myself into a top to protect myself, while using my Dancing Tops to attack."
8317,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"My strategy might be boring, but it's effective for racking up points."
8318,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.
8319,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You can attack him until
8320,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Ten{\i0
8321,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Hatsu{\i0
8322,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Both methods require a large amount of aura.
8323,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Ren{\i0 the technique to instantly generate aura.
8324,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Learning how to quickly \Ncreate large amounts of aura, and how to channel it into attacks, requires endless training and \Ncombat experience to learn."
8325,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He'd need five more years \Nbefore he could fight Gido.
8326,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.
8327,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What should I do?
8328,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What will it take to prolong this match?
8329,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If he scores one more point, it's over."
8330,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But I want to keep fighting.
8331,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What can I do right now?
8332,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,That would be...
8333,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon!
8334,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Ten{\i1
8335,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,That's reckless!
8336,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But he didn't simply release it.
8337,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,That's...
8338,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Zetsu...
8339,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The technique for concealing your presence!
8340,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Your aura also disappears because \Nyour micropyles are sealed.
8341,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Any aura that normally escapes \Nyour body is also nullified,"
8342,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i1
8343,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Zetsu{\i1
8344,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Did he learn it on his own, before we met?"
8345,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Zetsu{\i1
8346,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He must have learned it while attempting to track a beast or other target...
8347,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The boy certainly has incredible potential.
8348,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"But why would he use it now, \Nin this situation?"
8349,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Idiot!
8350,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8351,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I know that.
8352,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"But in order to track the tops' complex \Npathing with only sensations to go on,"
8353,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I must focus all my senses...
8354,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Could it be that he never expected to win?
8355,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He's risking his life...
8356,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Risking his life to train?
8357,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"You don't want to live, kid?"
8358,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Then I'll help you die!
8359,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What?!
8360,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Amazing!
8361,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It's the first time Gon has managed \Nto evade an attack!
8362,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I can feel them...
8363,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I know where they're heading!
8364,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,This is all I can do right now...
8365,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Concentrate on dodging \Nmy opponent's attacks!
8366,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I can still fight!
8367,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Your right radius and ulna were both broken.
8368,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Fractured humerus.
8369,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Three broken ribs.
8370,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Twelve other minor fractures.
8371,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Four months before you're \Ncompletely healed up.
8372,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You moron!
8373,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Sorry.
8374,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,An apology won't help!
8375,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Do you have any brains in there?
8376,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Didn't you see what happened \Nto those who'd suffered
8377,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8378,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"One wrong move, and you could \Nhave ended up like them!"
8379,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You're lucky not to be hurt any worse.
8380,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Man, why do you think \NFour-Eyes was training us?"
8381,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Still...
8382,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I had a feeling I'd be okay.
8383,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"I took a few hits, but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long \Nas he missed my vital spots..."
8384,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Come in.
8385,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Four-Eyes!
8386,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Uh, sorry..."
8387,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,An apology won't help!
8388,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What were you thinking?!
8389,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8390,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You could have ended up just like them!
8391,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Oh, that's what I just told him."
8392,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Honestly...
8393,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.
8394,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Wing-san, I really am sorry."
8395,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"No, I won't let this one slide."
8396,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Killua-kun, do you know when Gon-kun will \Nhave recovered completely?"
8397,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The doctor said it would take two months.
8398,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I understand.
8399,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Thank you, Killua."
8400,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"In that case,"
8401,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I won't allow you to participate in \Nany matches for two months!
8402,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8403,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If you don't abide by these rules,"
8404,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I will never teach you again.
8405,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Well?
8406,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I understand. I'll do as you say.
8407,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Give me your left hand.
8408,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,This is a promise thread.
8409,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
8410,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Killua-kun, a moment, please."
8411,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Killua-kun, what is the true objective \Nyou two are pursuing?"
8412,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Well, we don't really have an objective."
8413,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Before running into Zushi and you, my plan was to earn some quick cash."
8414,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Gon's here to train hard, \Nso he can defeat a guy named Hisoka."
8415,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"That's it, really."
8416,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Looks like the others in the 200s \Nwant to reach the top floor.
8417,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Battle Olympia, was it?"
8418,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I'm not too interested.
8419,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Oh, Gon is..."
8420,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Well, I'm not sure..."
8421,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.
8422,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"But after seeing his match yesterday,"
8423,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...
8424,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,How long will this exchange continue?
8425,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There are nearly fifty tops flying \Naround the ring!
8426,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon is evading the frightening \Nwhirlwind of tops!
8427,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Gido has used up all of his tops, and can only watch with the rest of us!"
8428,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Not that way!
8429,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There's nowhere to run...
8430,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You say that he was enjoying a situation that could have cost him his life?
8431,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Yeah.
8432,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I know because I've felt the same way.
8433,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Although I take circumstances \Ninto consideration, too."
8434,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Once he's in the zone, he loses sight of everything else."
8435,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Oh!
8436,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"But he isn't the type to break a \Npromise twice, so you needn't worry."
8437,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Perhaps I have...
8438,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It's too late.
8439,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Because Gon and I already know.
8440,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If you regret teaching us \Nand decide to back out, we'll find someone else, \Nor we'll learn it ourselves."
8441,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You don't have to feel responsible.
8442,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0 so Gon and I were bound to \Ndiscover it eventually.
8443,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I understand.
8444,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,And I mean to finish what I started.
8445,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,There are many things I must tell you.
8446,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Zushi is waiting in my lodge.
8447,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You can train with him.
8448,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"No, I'll pass."
8449,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Huh?
8450,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I won't leave Gon behind.
8451,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"If he keeps his promise, \NI'll start training when he does."
8452,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Tell Gon-kun this...
8453,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"I will allow him to practice the other ""Nen""!"
8454,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Tell him to practice ""Ten"" daily!"
8455,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Hey, Gon."
8456,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Master...
8457,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I may have awakened an incredible beast...
8458,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Master?
8459,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What do you mean?
8460,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"You found the agency on your own, so you must be sharp."
8461,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But I can't recommend you to \None of our valued clients.
8462,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I have no problem with your lack of experience.
8463,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Some clients don't mind greenhorns.
8464,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But it isn't experience alone that you lack.
8465,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What do you mean?
8466,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I said that I have a Hunter License!
8467,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,But your exam hasn't ended yet.
8468,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I can tell.
8469,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What?
8470,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Can you see anything?
8471,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Eh?
8472,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Next to me.
8473,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"You can't see a thing, right?"
8474,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Once you've learned to see, return."
8475,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,That's the bare minimum.
8476,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What does she mean?
8477,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,What is it that I cannot see?
8478,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"You can't see it, but you can sense it."
8479,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Why did you do that?!
8480,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,This?
8481,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Well, I was just playing with you."
8482,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.
8483,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Consider this advice from a veteran...
8484,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"You didn't notice when I stole this, and you didn't notice when I walked past you."
8485,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Bastard... Return my Hunter License!
8486,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Can a newbie who knows nothing
8487,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8488,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen?
8489,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Wanna give it a try?
8490,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Understand now?
8491,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You still lack something.
8492,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I...
8493,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I need...
8494,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Enough power to fight on my own!
8495,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Come with me.
8496,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,I'll be your teacher.
8497,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,The real exam has only just begun.
8498,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.
8499,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,And Kurapika has also encountered a new power that will help propel him forward.
8500,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
8501,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit

8507,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
8508,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Today, we introduce the Hunter Agency!"
8509,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,A place that helps Hunters \Nfind work.
8510,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,This place helps pro Hunters find work.
8511,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8512,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,It was hard to find the office Kurapika visited.
8513,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Nen{\i0
8514,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,You must be able to find the agency before you qualify as a pro Hunter.
8515,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,Next time: Destiny x And x Tenacity!
8516,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"So who is Four-Eyes, anyway?"
8517,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,"Hmm, I wonder who the Floor Masters are."
8518,Fierce x And x Ferocious!,30,C-Could it be?

8538,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Master?
8539,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Master...
8540,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I may have awakened an incredible beast...
8541,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Destiny x And x Tenacity
8542,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,One month has passed since Gon was badly injured \Nin his match with Gido.
8543,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"In Heavens Arena, all eyes are focused on a \Ncertain upcoming match."
8544,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Gon, I got something good..."
8545,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, Killua,"
8546,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I was about to go looking for you.
8547,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Uh...
8548,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Are you really healed?
8549,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Yeah!
8550,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,See? I'm perfectly fine!
8551,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Okay, I get it."
8552,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Those injuries should've kept him \Nout of action for four months, but he recovered in a month."
8553,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Man, what is your body made of?"
8554,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,How to answer that...
8555,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You're weird.
8556,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Well?
8557,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Weren't you about to say something?
8558,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, here."
8559,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Tickets?
8560,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,These aren't just tickets.
8561,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,They're for Hisoka's fight.
8562,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets."
8563,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,The tickets to Hisoka's match \Nare a really hot item.
8564,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,There are even scalpers hawking them.
8565,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Oh...
8566,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,So I've been gathering information.
8567,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.
8568,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's."
8569,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Each KO has led to death.
8570,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,But he's lost three matches...
8571,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,His three losses were due to forfeits.
8572,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Forfeits?
8573,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"He reached the registration deadline, so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show."
8574,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Which means...
8575,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose."
8576,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Yeah.
8577,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,And he's only given up a total of four points.
8578,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"One knockdown, three clean hits."
8579,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He's as strong as a Floor Master.
8580,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm in trouble...
8581,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Jeez.
8582,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You don't look like someone who \Nthinks they're in trouble.
8583,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro."
8584,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Two years ago, he claimed the sole \Nknockdown against Hisoka."
8585,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"And of the four points scored against Hisoka, he's responsible for three."
8586,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He scored three points against Hisoka...
8587,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You could say they have a history.
8588,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Apparently, they both registered for the \Nsame day so they could fight each other."
8589,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You should have the chance to \Nanalyze Hisoka's fighting style.
8590,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.
8591,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,But is this okay?
8592,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I promised Wing-san...
8593,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I won't allow you to participate in \Nany matches for two months!
8594,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Nen{\i0
8595,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Of course it's okay!
8596,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You'll just be watching a match.
8597,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It is not okay!
8598,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Nen{\i0
8599,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,W-Wing-san...
8600,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Don't scare us.
8601,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Gon-kun, has your arm healed?"
8602,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Y-Yes! It's fine now.
8603,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He has unbelievable regenerative powers.
8604,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Since he's recovered, he can \Nwatch the match, right?"
8605,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months."
8606,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Gon-kun, you should spend one more month practicing ""Ten,"" and recovering \Nfrom your injuries."
8607,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Oh...
8608,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Okay, I understand."
8609,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Well, then it's fine."
8610,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Osu! Take care.
8611,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, well..."
8612,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"You'll have to watch a recording, so I'll go and see it in person."
8613,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He's kept his promise.
8614,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"He's only practiced ""Ten"" each day."
8615,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him under normal circumstances.
8616,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Their auras flow like serene rivers.
8617,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Master?
8618,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Hmm?
8619,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, never mind..."
8620,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It's nothing.
8621,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,This won't do...
8622,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm the one who's losing control.
8623,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!"
8624,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Today in Heavens Arena, \Nwe have Kastro versus Hisoka, the match you've all been waiting for!"
8625,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Just look at this crowd!
8626,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"The match doesn't start for another hour, but the arena is already packed!"
8627,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,This is a promise thread.
8628,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
8629,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Two years ago, Hisoka was \Nthe winner of their match."
8630,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"The audience is fired up to \Nwatch this match of destiny, as Kastro looks for revenge!"
8631,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Sporting an 8-3 record, with all three losses being forfeits due to absence, we have the deadly magician with the \Ntendency toward absence, Hisoka!"
8632,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record, one win away from the Floor Masters after \Nnine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka, we have the martial artist, Kastro!"
8633,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Will he avenge his earlier loss, \Nas he's predicted?"
8634,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Get ready for a battle between the two fighters nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!
8635,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...
8636,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Next up, we have an interview with \NKastro, from a few days ago."
8637,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.
8638,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You'll see that I'm not the same \Nperson I was two years ago.
8639,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, he sounds confident..."
8640,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,We'll see if he can back it up.
8641,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Wh-What?
8642,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,There he is.
8643,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Was there something you needed?
8644,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What?
8645,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,R-Ridiculous.
8646,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He was just sitting on the couch...
8647,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,When did he move?
8648,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Did he open the door and slip behind me, without catching my attention?"
8649,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"No, that's impossible!"
8650,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I never took my eyes off the door until after he spoke.
8651,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He never had the chance.
8652,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,How did he do this?
8653,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph."
8654,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,From me?
8655,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"You honor me,"
8656,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Killua-kun.
8657,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.
8658,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You're not with Gon?
8659,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Oh, so you do know everything."
8660,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Are you here to scout an opponent?
8661,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Nope,"
8662,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I just wanted a closer look.
8663,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,And what do you think?
8664,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You're pretty damn good.
8665,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Thank you.
8666,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Zetsu{\i0
8667,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"However, you should have concealed your presence \Nbefore reaching this floor."
8668,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"When an aura as strong as yours disappears, that would put most of us on alert."
8669,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You've been following up on me \Nsince I reached this floor?
8670,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Pretty much.
8671,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Then I want to know...
8672,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,How did you do that just now?
8673,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Unfortunately, I can't tell you."
8674,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"After all, I might have to fight you someday."
8675,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Don't worry.
8676,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm not interested in fighting here again.
8677,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Really?
8678,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That isn't what your aura says.
8679,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That was a joke.
8680,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'll answer your question when we fight.
8681,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.
8682,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm sure you can get there.
8683,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I told you I'm not interested in fighting!
8684,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Yes, it's finally time..."
8685,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,The long-awaited rematch between \NHisoka and Kastro!
8686,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"I'm very grateful, Hisoka."
8687,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"If not for the initiation you gave me back then,"
8688,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'd never have become this strong.
8689,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You mean to imply that you're stronger now?
8690,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Just so you're aware,"
8691,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I never used my full strength in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.
8692,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Those matches were nothing more than a warm-up for my defeat of you.
8693,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Begin!
8694,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Here I come!
8695,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,A clean hit!
8696,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Kastro has landed the first strike!
8697,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What was that?
8698,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Give me your best shot, Hisoka."
8699,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Kastro is the one to land the first strike!
8700,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Hisoka has surrendered the first point, after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!"
8701,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Again... An illusion?
8702,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm not the same person I was two years ago.
8703,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I won't hold back on my next attack.
8704,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You'll have my best shot when \NI deem it necessary.
8705,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Very well.
8706,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.
8707,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Again...
8708,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I was sure he dodged that!
8709,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What's wrong?
8710,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Will you just run around, rather than attack?"
8711,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Clean hit! And knockdown!
8712,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What an amazing start!
8713,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!
8714,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,The score is now 4-0.
8715,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"However, are my eyes deceiving me?"
8716,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Have you still not changed your mind?
8717,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Would you prefer to die ignorant?
8718,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,C-Can you fight?
8719,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"If I am not mistaken, you seemed to disappear..."
8720,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That's right!
8721,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He disappeared!
8722,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That's what I saw!
8723,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"No, that is not an accurate description."
8724,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"You were readying a kick from the front, when suddenly, you were behind me."
8725,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I suppose that would be more precise.
8726,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,But that doesn't sound right...
8727,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Something is off.
8728,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Yes,"
8729,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I feel I'm missing something very basic here...
8730,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It's futile.
8731,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"If you continue to run in circles, \Nyou'll never learn the truth."
8732,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Because I'm done waiting.
8733,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'll take your arm with my next strike.
8734,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"If you still will not attack, then so be it."
8735,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It seems you weren't good enough.
8736,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Tiger Bite Fist
8737,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!
8738,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Kastro's getting serious!
8739,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Tiger Bite Fist?
8740,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"That technique can split a tree in two, when used by a master."
8741,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't \Nfigured out Kastro's ability."
8742,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Well, I don't really understand it, either."
8743,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!"
8744,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Here I come!
8745,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Go ahead and take it.
8746,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Not worried, huh?"
8747,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Or is this meant to be a trap?
8748,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Either way,"
8749,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'll take your arm!
8750,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Your other one.
8751,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Hisoka's arm!
8752,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Hisoka's right arm has been severed!
8753,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You shouldn't assume that \NI'll act the way you want.
8754,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,This was just part of the plan.
8755,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What crap.
8756,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Have we ever seen Hisoka in \Nsuch a perilous situation?
8757,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He's taken considerable damage!
8758,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I understand.
8759,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Your ability is, in fact, a double."
8760,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Impressive.
8761,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You are correct.
8762,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,A double?
8763,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What does he mean?
8764,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Then it wasn't an illusion!
8765,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"When Kastro attacked, there really were two of him."
8766,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,What is going on here?
8767,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Kastro has split into two?
8768,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Cloned himself?
8769,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!"
8770,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Does he actually have a twin?!
8771,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Is this your doppelganger?
8772,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Indeed.
8773,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Doppelganger?
8774,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Yes.
8775,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Master, what does that mean?"
8776,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"It refers to a double, as in an additional you."
8777,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"When you spot someone who resembles you, that's called a doppelganger."
8778,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Er, I don't get it..."
8779,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"When you encounter a doppelganger, you experience headaches and fatigue, which continue until your double is destroyed."
8780,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Some believe that the double takes energy from the original.
8781,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.
8782,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,He's really strong.
8783,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That's only a story.
8784,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Besides, he mastered this \Nability through training."
8785,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"I listened to your warning, and I watched carefully, rather than run."
8786,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,And it turns out my deduction that \Nyou disappeared was correct.
8787,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,So why did I question that description?
8788,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,That's because
8789,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I still sensed your presence beside me.
8790,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"In fact, right before you disappeared,"
8791,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I felt a new presence.
8792,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You duplicate yourself before disappearing.
8793,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.
8794,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Nen{\i0
8795,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"My double goes on the attack, while I hide in the shadows."
8796,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"As soon as you react,"
8797,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"I dismiss my double, and attack."
8798,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,So those fluttering clothes were \Nmeant to help him hide.
8799,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"The most skilled Nen user would still experience difficulty in figuring out \Nthis trick, while in combat."
8800,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Naturally, my double is no mere illusion."
8801,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,It exists as a second me until I send it away.
8802,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,You know this after suffering \Nan attack from my double.
8803,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"In other words, you must fight both of my selves."
8804,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Nen{\i0
8805,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!

8807,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Incredible! We have an \Nupset in the making!
8808,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Hisoka, the winner two years ago, \Nis in deep trouble!"
8809,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Will Kastro be able to avenge \Nhis previous defeat?
8810,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Next, I will take your left arm."
8811,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,Will you continue to act disinterested?
8812,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"Hmm, let's see..."
8813,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,I think I have a little motivation now.
8814,Destiny x And x Tenacity!,31,"The fearsome double-user, Kastro, and the magician, Hisoka."

8862,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist, has severed Hisoka's right arm."
8863,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Who will emerge victorious?
8864,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What's this?
8865,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?
8866,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?
8867,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Wow!
8868,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"His right arm has disappeared, \Nand cards rain down!"
8869,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What does he intend to do?!
8870,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Now, then..."
8871,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"I have cards here, from one to thirteen."
8872,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Pick a number from these, and picture it in your head."
8873,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Pick a number?
8874,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Are you ready?
8875,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Once you have your number, add four, and double the result."
8876,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"After that, subtract six, and divide by two."
8877,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Finally, subtract your original number, and what do you have?"
8878,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Um...
8879,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Hey, did he say to subtract six?"
8880,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Jeez, I don't know!"
8881,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I already know your answer.
8882,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The answer is one.
8883,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He's right!
8884,A x Surprising x Win!,32,How?
8885,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Seriously?
8886,A x Surprising x Win!,32,This is very strange...
8887,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Insane!
8888,A x Surprising x Win!,32,A satanic magic trick!
8889,A x Surprising x Win!,32,And he's incorporated his own \Ninjury into the trick!
8890,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Why is he so calm?
8891,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The trick is worth no points.
8892,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"That had no effect on the match, but he's performing tricks!"
8893,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!
8894,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You may keep this as a souvenir.

8896,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"I will sever your left arm, so you can never mock anyone again."
8897,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Did you not hear me the first time?
8898,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You may have it.
8899,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Your wish will be granted!
8900,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!
8901,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!
8902,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What is he thinking?!
8903,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What?
8904,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"As expected, you attacked with your double."
8905,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Had you, yourself, attacked, \NI would have countered."
8906,A x Surprising x Win!,32,With this.
8907,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!
8908,A x Surprising x Win!,32,This is another magic trick.
8909,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Can you guess the secret behind it?
8910,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He's lying...
8911,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He's obviously employing Nen \Nto accomplish this feat.
8912,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But what type of Nen is he using?
8913,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What's wrong?
8914,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Are you frightened?
8915,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You're surprised because you \Ndon't understand my trick.
8916,A x Surprising x Win!,32,That's how magic works.
8917,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Your power to create a double \Nis certainly magnificent.
8918,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But now I understand your ability.
8919,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I can also anticipate how you \Nwill attack with your double.
8920,A x Surprising x Win!,32,And I know how to counter that attack.
8921,A x Surprising x Win!,32,It's quite unfortunate.
8922,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You have the talent to \Nbecome a skilled opponent.
8923,A x Surprising x Win!,32,That was why I spared your life.
8924,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Here is a prediction...
8925,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"You will die, in a frenzied dance."
8926,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Silence!
8927,A x Surprising x Win!,32,H-How did he pick me out?
8928,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Doubles are created in the original's image, so they tend to be pristine."
8929,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But you can't recreate every \Neffect of an ongoing battle.
8930,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Oh?
8931,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Did you not realize this?
8932,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What is going on here?
8933,A x Surprising x Win!,32,This sequence of events is \Nimpossible to understand!
8934,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?
8935,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Don't bother.
8936,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"I hit you in the chin, so you'll have difficulty moving for a while."
8937,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Meaning that you won't be able \Nto evade my next attack.
8938,A x Surprising x Win!,32,What?
8939,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Where did this attack come from?
8940,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"No, I don't have time for that..."
8941,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I must use a double to block the cards!
8942,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You can't create another double.
8943,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0
8944,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The only reason you were able \Nto use doubles freely was because you had a normal state of mind.
8945,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0 something as complex as a human being is extremely difficult.
8946,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Just how difficult is it?
8947,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"By the time you've learned to use a double,"
8948,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0
8949,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I call that running out of memory.
8950,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You lost because you wasted memory space.
8951,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Kastro can no longer stand!
8952,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka wins by knockout!
8953,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka...
8954,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Good work.
8955,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Now, show me that injury."
8956,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"I was never absolutely certain, but today's match confirmed it."
8957,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You are an idiot.
8958,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Perhaps.
8959,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Why do you endanger yourself this way?
8960,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Was that meant as a \Nperformance or something?
8961,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Who knows?
8962,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid."
8963,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'll stop your bleeding first.
8964,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Hey, hey."
8965,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Please try to be gentle.
8966,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura."
8967,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'll start with the left arm.
8968,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Here I go.
8969,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen Stitches.
8970,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen Stitches
8971,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Okay, all done."
8972,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles."
8973,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Basically, it's one hundred percent connected."
8974,A x Surprising x Win!,32,An excellent job.
8975,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Next,"
8976,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'll do your right arm.
8977,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hold it yourself this time.
8978,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'm always mesmerized by your skill.
8979,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Perhaps I get myself injured so I can watch you work your magic.
8980,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Right.
8981,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Twenty million for the left arm.
8982,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Fifty million for the right.
8983,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Pay up. Now.
8984,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'll send the money to your account.
8985,A x Surprising x Win!,32,All right.
8986,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You can treat the rest of \Nyour injuries yourself.
8987,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You could provide better service.
8988,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You should be able to manage \Nwith your Bungee Gum and Texture Surprise.
8989,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Oh...
8990,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I should probably conceal this.
8991,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"That way, they'll think my arms were \Nhealed during the match."
8992,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"This is an ordinary scarf, \Nwith no special features."
8993,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I use Bungee Gum to attach it to my arm.
8994,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Then I use Texture Surprise \Nto create a layer of skin.
8995,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He's so fast...
8996,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Nen{\i1 into believing the arm had actually healed, before he even knew what was happening."
8997,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Next, I'll do the left."
8998,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Bungee Gum...
8999,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)
9000,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He molds his aura into a substance with the properties of rubber and gum.
9001,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"It can stretch, swiftly contract, adhere to most substances, and be removed at any time."
9002,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"By the way, I call this Bungee Gum \Nbecause when I was a child, that was the name of my \Nfavorite chewing gum."
9003,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I didn't need to know that.
9004,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Texture Surprise...
9005,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)
9006,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"He combines aura with the power of his imagination, to reproduce the appearance of skin."
9007,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Essentially, it's a high-quality copy, \Nso you can tell it's fake if you touch it."
9008,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill..."
9009,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The name Texture Surprise \Ncomes from the stickers that were included with a popular snack a while back.
9010,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Like I said, I didn't need to know that."
9011,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But weren't you impressed by my application of these two abilities during the fight?
9012,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Huh?
9013,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"You saw everything, didn't you?"
9014,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Well, yeah..."
9015,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"As a distraction, you sent thirteen cards flying into the air, while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum."
9016,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The aura from each was also tied to your right arm.
9017,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Additionally, you connected aura to \Nthe thirteen cards on the floor, and held the ends with your left hand."
9018,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Then, when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,"
9019,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You may keep this as a souvenir. the aura in your left hand was released.
9020,A x Surprising x Win!,32,And connected.
9021,A x Surprising x Win!,32,The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.
9022,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But Kastro never noticed.
9023,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"You employed one of the basic techniques,"
9024,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Zetsu{\i0
9025,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"However, there was a flaw..."
9026,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Ren{\i0 another of the basic techniques,"
9027,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0 to see through your plan.
9028,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"That's why you used that twisted magic trick \Nto throw him off guard, while you pretended to be \Nreserving your strength."
9029,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"It even worked as camouflage, \Nconvincing him that your lack of aura was a sign of confidence."
9030,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"After meticulously confirming \Nthat your plan was working, you extended a thread of \Naura from your left hand, the same one holding the cards, \Nand connected it to Kastro's chin."
9031,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Your preparations were now complete.
9032,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You'd already used Texture Surprise to alter the scarf on the floor \Nto resemble human skin.
9033,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"And so, when Kastro attacked your left arm, you activated the Bungee Gum between your right arm and \Nthe scarf on the floor."
9034,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Your arm was restored, and the scarf concealed the wound, leaving everyone convinced that \Nyour right arm was restored."
9035,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"However, this performance actually \Nhelped Kastro to calm down."
9036,A x Surprising x Win!,32,It made no sense for a severed arm to reappear in a pristine state...
9037,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0
9038,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But you didn't miss the subtle change \Nin his psychological state.
9039,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Your power to create a double \Nis certainly magnificent.
9040,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But now I understand your ability.
9041,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I can also anticipate how you \Nwill attack with your double.
9042,A x Surprising x Win!,32,And I know how to counter that attack.
9043,A x Surprising x Win!,32,It's quite unfortunate.
9044,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You have the talent to \Nbecome a skilled opponent.
9045,A x Surprising x Win!,32,That was why I spared your life.
9046,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Kastro was about to recover.
9047,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Here is a prediction...
9048,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"You will die, in a frenzied dance."
9049,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But then you pushed him over the edge.
9050,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Silence!
9051,A x Surprising x Win!,32,H-How did he pick me out?
9052,A x Surprising x Win!,32,But you can't recreate every \Neffect of an ongoing battle.
9053,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You exposed the weakness of his doubles.
9054,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"But had he stayed composed, \Nhe had a fair chance."
9055,A x Surprising x Win!,32,However...
9056,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...
9057,A x Surprising x Win!,32,And he lost.
9058,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You realize that those two abilities are perfect for you.
9059,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"As opposed to Kastro's doubles, if my opponent knows of my abilities,"
9060,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.
9061,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Well,"
9062,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I'm off.
9063,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Already?
9064,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"My job is done, so I'm not sticking around."
9065,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Since Nen Stitches can only do so much, don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached."
9066,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Oh, that's right."
9067,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I came here for a reason.
9068,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I have new orders.
9069,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City by noon, August 30th, not just \Nthose who find it convenient."
9070,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Will the boss be coming?
9071,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Most likely.
9072,A x Surprising x Win!,32,This could be our biggest job yet.
9073,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"If you skip this one, the boss might hunt you down himself."
9074,A x Surprising x Win!,32,How very scary.
9075,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?"
9076,A x Surprising x Win!,32,A pity.
9077,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?
9078,A x Surprising x Win!,32,It was boring.
9079,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Did Hisoka win?
9080,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I was lying.
9081,A x Surprising x Win!,32,It was an incredible fight.
9082,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"I hate to admit this, but I have \Nno idea how Hisoka won."
9083,A x Surprising x Win!,32,You couldn't tell?
9084,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Gon,"
9085,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Nen{\i0
9086,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Yeah!
9087,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He doesn't talk.
9088,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He doesn't talk about the past.
9089,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He has no interest in the past.
9090,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"By tomorrow, I imagine he'll \Nhave forgotten Kastro's face."
9091,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He doesn't associate with others.
9092,A x Surprising x Win!,32,He's his own man.
9093,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Because he believes himself to be the strongest.
9094,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"Oh, I forgot to remove this."
9095,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Spider...
9096,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I found some new toys to play with.
9097,A x Surprising x Win!,32,I suppose it's time to start the hunt.
9098,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Hisoka has been masquerading \Nas a Phantom Troupe member.
9099,A x Surprising x Win!,32,"To him, the Phantom Troupe \Nis simply another target."

9118,A x Surprising x Win!,32,Do I have a cold?

9145,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Wing has summoned Gon \Nand Killua to see him.
9146,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon-kun. Killua-kun.
9147,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Starting today, you'll train with Zushi."
9148,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Gon-kun, I'm pleased that you kept your word."
9149,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's thanks to your promise thread.
9150,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"A few times, I almost gave in."
9151,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"But when I looked at the thread,"
9152,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I was able to control myself.
9153,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9154,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Huh? Really?
9155,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"No, I was lying."
9156,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Huh?
9157,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But how could you tell that he kept his word?
9158,An x Empty x Threat!,33,He could have been practicing in secret.
9159,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Because the promise thread remained intact.
9160,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ten{\i0
9161,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's okay?
9162,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yes.
9163,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Crap, do I remember how to do this?"
9164,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's been so long.
9165,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Can I still pull it off?
9166,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Zushi, what do you think?"
9167,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I-It's amazing!
9168,An x Empty x Threat!,33,His aura is flowing all around him!
9169,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Soft and calm...
9170,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But it's very strong!
9171,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I did it!
9172,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Whew...
9173,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I was worried that I might \Nhave forgotten how.
9174,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Once you've learned the technique, \Nyou can't forget it."
9175,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"However, to become a master, you'll have to train hard."
9176,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"But it felt easier than before,"
9177,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ten{\i0
9178,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's because you were training your spirit each day.
9179,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Now, look at your left hand."
9180,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Huh?
9181,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It snapped!
9182,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9183,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0 it would snap.
9184,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's actually possible?
9185,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Hey, Wing-san..."
9186,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?
9187,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yes, I did."
9188,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What was the ability that Hisoka used?
9189,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Could we send loose limbs flying around?
9190,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Hmm, that's a difficult question."
9191,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?"
9192,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"No, not yet."
9193,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Then I'll explain while we watch.
9194,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Can you see the threads of aura \Nextending from his left hand?
9195,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Threads of aura?
9196,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yes.
9197,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Do you see them?
9198,An x Empty x Threat!,33,N-Nope.
9199,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I can't see a thing.
9200,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Same here.
9201,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Are there really threads of aura coming from Hisoka's left hand?
9202,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yes, Hisoka is using a technique that makes his aura difficult to perceive."

9214,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Right.
9215,An x Empty x Threat!,33,My assignment for you two
9216,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren{\i0
9217,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Eh?
9218,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Uh, master?"
9219,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What should I do?
9220,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Zushi,"
9221,An x Empty x Threat!,33,In{\i0
9222,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I should?
9223,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren{\i0
9224,An x Empty x Threat!,33,O-Osu!
9225,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren!
9226,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's so strong.
9227,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"It doesn't have a much greater magnitude, but it's very dense."
9228,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Then direct that aura into your eyes.
9229,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Osu!
9230,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo!
9231,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"So, can you see the aura that emanates from Hisoka's body?"
9232,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yes.
9233,An x Empty x Threat!,33,And how many threads are there?
9234,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Twelve...
9235,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"No, I think it's thirteen."
9236,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Not quite.
9237,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But you were close.
9238,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I could really see them!
9239,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"You're making excellent progress, Zushi."
9240,An x Empty x Threat!,33,O-Osu...
9241,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Thank you very much.
9242,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo{\i0
9243,An x Empty x Threat!,33,In{\i0
9244,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"But with enough training,"
9245,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo{\i0
9246,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Do you understand?
9247,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren{\i0
9248,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren{\i0
9249,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Then you'll discover the true nature of Hisoka's ability.
9250,An x Empty x Threat!,33,And will you be able to use that same ability?
9251,An x Empty x Threat!,33,My answer is both yes and no.
9252,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,"
9253,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9254,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"However,"

9257,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9258,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0 you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.
9259,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's important that you first identify \Nyour own strengths.
9260,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Strengths...
9261,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You've only just begun to develop.
9262,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You haven't settled on one form yet.
9263,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Initially, try to grow as much as you can."
9264,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That is the purpose of this training.
9265,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Train hard, play hard, and enjoy life."
9266,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Osu!
9267,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"The final day of Killua-kun's \Nwindow to fight is June 9th, and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?"
9268,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'd like you both to register for your final day.
9269,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"In the meantime, you'll train."
9270,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo{\i0
9271,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Osu!
9272,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ren{\i0
9273,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You moved way ahead while I was resting.
9274,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"No, I still have a long path before me."
9275,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Hey, let's practice what we just learned."
9276,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon."
9277,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Okay.
9278,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Killua... Zushi.
9279,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Osu!
9280,An x Empty x Threat!,33,We have company.
9281,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You guys don't know when to quit.
9282,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's why no one likes you.
9283,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Oh, don't be so harsh."
9284,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Tell me when you're going to fight, because I'd love to be your opponent."
9285,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.
9286,An x Empty x Threat!,33,They want to rack up wins \Nby beating us up.
9287,An x Empty x Threat!,33,We're getting desperate...
9288,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Because our deadline is nearing.
9289,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Come on, let's fight."
9290,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'll even demonstrate my power right now.
9291,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'm fighting on June 10th.
9292,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Hey, Gon!"
9293,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That won't work.
9294,An x Empty x Threat!,33,My deadline is May 29th.
9295,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Fight on that day.
9296,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Who cares about your deadline, moron?"
9297,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Let's go.
9298,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon-chan...
9299,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You and I will fight.
9300,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I guarantee it.
9301,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Gon, ignore him."
9302,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What will you do?
9303,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'll force him to fight me.
9304,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Visualize the energy building in your body.
9305,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Power gathers in each cell, and grows."
9306,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Then you force that power out!
9307,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'm getting used to this.
9308,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ten{\i0 was a little tricky.
9309,An x Empty x Threat!,33,A-A little?
9310,An x Empty x Threat!,33,They pick it up too fast!
9311,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.
9312,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Guess we should practice more.
9313,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"N-No, that's enough!"
9314,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Learning when to rest is part of training.
9315,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Let's call it a day.
9316,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Really? I can still—
9317,An x Empty x Threat!,33,No!
9318,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If they pass me in half a day, \NI'll lose all my motivation..."
9319,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Oh...
9320,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Well, it's okay."
9321,An x Empty x Threat!,33,We'll practice more tomorrow.
9322,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yeah.
9323,An x Empty x Threat!,33,See you tomorrow.
9324,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Bye.
9325,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Okay, then..."
9326,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I can't...
9327,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I can't move!
9328,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I can't talk or breathe...
9329,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What's going on?
9330,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Oops.
9331,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Please...
9332,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Forget it.
9333,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I figured you were up to something.
9334,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But you don't need dirty tricks \Nto make me fight you.
9335,An x Empty x Threat!,33,When do you want to fight?
9336,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Don't worry.
9337,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'll let you win.
9338,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'll even give you each a win.
9339,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Is that good enough?
9340,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"After I get my win off you,"
9341,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'm going to fight Gon-chan.
9342,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If you want to fight Gon, you'll have to follow his schedule."
9343,An x Empty x Threat!,33,He'll be more than happy to fight you.
9344,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I can promise you that.
9345,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Okay.
9346,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If you two are willing to fight, we don't need to bother with this."
9347,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Let's go register together.
9348,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed."
9349,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, yeah. Sure..."
9350,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But only this once.
9351,An x Empty x Threat!,33,May 29th...
9352,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Okay, happy now?"
9353,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yes, we'll return him."
9354,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal."
9355,An x Empty x Threat!,33,If you break your promise...
9356,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Eh... Whatever.
9357,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Forget it.
9358,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What? You got me curious.
9359,An x Empty x Threat!,33,What will happen if we break our promise?
9360,An x Empty x Threat!,33,No point in telling you now.
9361,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Just keep your word.
9362,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Hello? Is this Gon-kun?
9363,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'm sure you'll understand what this means.
9364,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"As long as you don't tell anyone, \Nand you follow my instructions, the three of you will be able to \Ntrain as usual tomorrow."
9365,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Zushi...
9366,An x Empty x Threat!,33,How did it go with Gon-chan?
9367,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Perfect.
9368,An x Empty x Threat!,33,He's registered for the 30th.
9369,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's two wins.
9370,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Too easy.
9371,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Not killing people is pretty hard.
9372,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Clean living's tough...
9373,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Come on down! We have tickets!
9374,An x Empty x Threat!,33,These are fresh off the press...
9375,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon versus Sadaso!
9376,An x Empty x Threat!,33,And here's Killua versus Sadaso...
9377,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!"
9378,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Pops.
9379,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yep?
9380,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Does Sadaso have only one arm?
9381,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, the one-armed fighter, \Nwith the mask-like face."
9382,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If he catches you with his \Ninvisible left arm, you're finished."
9383,An x Empty x Threat!,33,They call him the newbie crusher...
9384,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That bastard.
9385,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Huh? Killua?
9386,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Gon, you were here?"
9387,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Y-Yeah...
9388,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Killua-kun,"
9389,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I believe you helped Zushi last night.
9390,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Thank you.
9391,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You feeling all right?
9392,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, I'm fine."
9393,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I was probably tired.
9394,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Sorry to worry you!
9395,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Oh, Wing-san..."
9396,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Can we watch that video again?
9397,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo{\i0
9398,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Really?
9399,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Fifteen threads, right?"
9400,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf, and a well hidden one that \Nleads to the arm he tossed."
9401,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Continue.
9402,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Hisoka is...
9403,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Hisoka's aura appears to expand and contract.
9404,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Or does it attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?"
9405,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Why else would his arm reattach?
9406,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Or fly into his opponent's chin?
9407,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's probably the former.
9408,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"His aura is elastic, like rubber."
9409,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That would explain most of his tricks.
9410,An x Empty x Threat!,33,He's on a completely different level!
9411,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Very good... You pass.
9412,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But I am surprised...
9413,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gyo{\i0
9414,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon?
9415,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Uh-huh, but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power."
9416,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"So, Killua-kun, since you finished your assignment, \NI assume you want to fight, yes?"
9417,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"O-Oh, I wasn't trying to \Nbeat you to the punch."
9418,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I just got an itch to fight.
9419,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, I get it."
9420,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Gon, they must have threatened you."
9421,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight."
9422,An x Empty x Threat!,33,May 29th.
9423,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Mine's May 30th.
9424,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's fine.
9425,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I underestimated how fast you could learn.
9426,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Ten{\i0
9427,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Be sure you get plenty \Nof practice, rest, and sleep."
9428,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Osu!
9429,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Killua...
9430,An x Empty x Threat!,33,They must have threatened you.
9431,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Now I'm mad...
9432,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Yeah, but my biggest concern was the master, and he agreed."
9433,An x Empty x Threat!,33,But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.
9434,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It'll be okay.
9435,An x Empty x Threat!,33,You don't need to worry.
9436,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win."
9437,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan \Nfor my seventh win."
9438,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Then I just need to find three more chumps.
9439,An x Empty x Threat!,33,And I'll be a Floor Master.
9440,An x Empty x Threat!,33,I'll get all the wealth and glory to \Nset me up for the rest of my life.
9441,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Move, and I will kill you..."
9442,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9443,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Make a sound, and I will kill you."
9444,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If you understand, slowly close your eyes."
9445,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Do you know what happens \Nif you break your word?
9446,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"If you know, slowly open your eyes."
9447,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully."
9448,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Never show your filthy face to us again.
9449,An x Empty x Threat!,33,That's a promise.
9450,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Time has run out for Sadaso!
9451,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Killua wins by default!
9452,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Damn, I want my money back!"
9453,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Killua opens the battle \Nagainst the persistent trio with a win by default.
9454,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Thanks to their inborn talent,"
9455,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9456,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Now they will start the real battle at Heavens Arena.
9457,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
9458,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
9459,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
9460,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Hunterpedia!
9461,An x Empty x Threat!,33,It's Gon and Killua's
9462,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Hunterpedia!
9463,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
9464,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Today, we introduce Sadaso."
9465,An x Empty x Threat!,33,A Heavens Arena \N200s-class warrior.
9466,An x Empty x Threat!,33,He underwent the traditional greeting with Gido and Riehlvelt.
9467,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9468,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yeah?
9469,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Nen{\i0
9470,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yeah?
9471,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Oh.
9472,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yeah?
9473,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Next time: Power x To x Avenge!
9474,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Power, yeah?"
9475,An x Empty x Threat!,33,"Avenge, yeah?"
9476,An x Empty x Threat!,33,Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
9477,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Heavens Arena.
9478,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"The 251-story, 991-meter building is a mecca for fighters."
9479,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"When combatants win a fight,\Nthey may advance by one class, and receive a corresponding reward."
9480,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"After reaching the 100th floor, you are assigned a private room."
9481,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"After reaching the 200th floor, you receive the right to challenge \Nthe strongest fighters, the Floor Masters, in an \Nintense battle of survival."
9482,Power x To x Avenge!,34,This is the best stage a warrior could ask for.
9483,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win."
9484,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan \Nfor my seventh win."
9485,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Then I just need to find three more chumps.
9486,Power x To x Avenge!,34,And I'll be a Floor Master.
9487,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'll get all the wealth and glory to \Nset me up for the rest of my life.
9488,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Move, and I will kill you..."
9489,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Nen{\i0
9490,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Make a sound, and I will kill you."
9491,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you understand, slowly close your eyes."
9492,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Do you know what happens \Nif you break your word?
9493,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you know, slowly open your eyes."
9494,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully."
9495,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Never show your filthy face to us again.
9496,Power x To x Avenge!,34,That's a promise.
9497,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Power x To x Avenge
9498,Power x To x Avenge!,34,There are many who would use underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.
9499,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"On the other hand,"
9500,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Nen{\i0
9501,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"And tonight, he has his battle with Sadaso."
9502,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
9503,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I was overcome with despair.
9504,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"The second he looked at me,"
9505,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I felt a difference in strength that made me realize my \Nhelplessness against him.
9506,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"It was a mistake to underestimate him, and to assume he was some normal kid."
9507,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm gonna disappear because I don't wanna die...
9508,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Be careful.
9509,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You guys are next.
9510,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What should we do?
9511,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm still in.
9512,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'll do whatever it takes.
9513,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.
9514,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Ten victories in the 200s win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.
9515,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Should you triumph, you get \Nan entire floor to yourself."
9516,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"And once you've earned the \Ntitle of Floor Master, you can lecture, serve as an advisor, or start a new martial arts school."
9517,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You can live off the title for \Nthe rest of your life.
9518,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Will that kid try threatening us?
9519,Power x To x Avenge!,34,The boy doesn't know my power.
9520,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"As long as we're careful, we can handle him."
9521,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You're wrong.
9522,Power x To x Avenge!,34,It's irrelevant to me what your power is.
9523,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I can threaten you whenever I want.
9524,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Whenever and wherever I choose...
9525,Power x To x Avenge!,34,When you're sound asleep...
9526,Power x To x Avenge!,34,When you're taking a dump.
9527,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Got it?
9528,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Now, listen up."
9529,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You have to follow the rules.
9530,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Without rules, we are the ones who would benefit."
9531,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Cheating really is a bad idea.
9532,Power x To x Avenge!,34,We'll have a fair fight.
9533,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Right.
9534,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Time has run out for Sadaso.
9535,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gon wins by default!
9536,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What? Again?
9537,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What is Sadaso doing?
9538,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 1st
9539,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 2nd
9540,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 3rd
9541,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 4th
9542,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today."
9543,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.
9544,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Are you feeling all right?
9545,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Yes.
9546,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Gon-kun, this will be your \Nsecond match with Gido."
9547,Power x To x Avenge!,34,So you shouldn't require much advice.
9548,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Do you have a plan?
9549,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Uh-huh.
9550,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Um, Wing-san, actually..."
9551,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm planning to use this.
9552,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I see...
9553,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match..."
9554,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gido versus Gon.
9555,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"In their previous encounter,"
9556,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Gon ended up in the hospital, but what will happen this time?"
9557,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Today, he's carrying a fishing rod."
9558,Power x To x Avenge!,34,How does he plan to use it?
9559,Power x To x Avenge!,34,How does he intend to fight?
9560,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Let's get this contest started!
9561,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Points and KO system.
9562,Power x To x Avenge!,34,No time limit!
9563,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Begin!
9564,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Wow! Gon's already taken off!
9565,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"But Gido was also prepared, as he's \Nalready using Tornado Top!"
9566,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If Gon charges in, he'll be in the same position as before."
9567,Power x To x Avenge!,34,So he anticipated that.
9568,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I know exactly what you're thinking...
9569,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Once I've begun to spin, \Nit's extremely hard to stop me."
9570,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Thus, the logical course would be a preemptive attack before I start."
9571,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What's wrong?
9572,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you won't make a move, I'll go first."
9573,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Shotgun Blues!
9574,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Shotgun Blues
9575,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?"
9576,Power x To x Avenge!,34,This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.
9577,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Every top will be aiming for you.
9578,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You can't avoid them all!
9579,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Ren!
9580,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What?
9581,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He stopped them!
9582,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Did you see that?
9583,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Wow...
9584,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Incredible!
9585,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He stopped the tops in their tracks!
9586,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He clearly isn't the same \Nperson as two months ago!
9587,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His Nen defense is far stronger now.
9588,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I can't win with my tops?
9589,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gon's reflexes are good enough to let him use his rod to knock down any tops that are stupid enough to come straight at him.
9590,Power x To x Avenge!,34,But he chose to use Ren to deal more psychological damage.
9591,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He must be pretty mad about how they used Zushi.
9592,Power x To x Avenge!,34,It's my turn now!
9593,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Well, what technique will Gon use?"
9594,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning."
9595,Power x To x Avenge!,34,But it won't be that simple.
9596,Power x To x Avenge!,34,There he goes...
9597,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Straight for Gido!
9598,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I knew it.
9599,Power x To x Avenge!,34,But that won't do you any good!
9600,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Oh, his attack missed!"
9601,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What were you aiming at?
9602,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What?!
9603,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Unbelievable...
9604,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!"
9605,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Wait!
9606,Power x To x Avenge!,34,G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.
9607,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gido can no longer continue to fight.
9608,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you're willing to do whatever it takes,"
9609,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I won't hold back.
9610,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"And if you touch Zushi again,"
9611,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'll smash your face in!
9612,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Our winner is Gon!
9613,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!
9614,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His record in the 200s is now 2-1!
9615,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Okay, it's my turn now."
9616,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"All right, up next is our main event..."
9617,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Killua versus Riehlvelt!
9618,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match, this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match."
9619,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What will his strategy be?
9620,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You're the ones who broke your promise.
9621,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I won't let you win now.
9622,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
9623,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"An underworld dweller, huh?"
9624,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"This boy may be a professional there, but Heavens Arena is my turf."
9625,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"I'll show him that, on this square stage,"
9626,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm better.
9627,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Fight, Killua-san!"
9628,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Points and KO system.
9629,Power x To x Avenge!,34,No time limit!
9630,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Begin!
9631,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He disappeared?
9632,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Behind me!
9633,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Aura Burst!
9634,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Aura Burst
9635,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!"
9636,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He uses the propulsion created \Nby releasing his stored aura to control his wheelchair at will.
9637,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I moved too fast.
9638,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Whew, that was close..."
9639,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Twin Snakes:
9640,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Song of Defense!
9641,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Song of Defense
9642,Power x To x Avenge!,34,There it is!
9643,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His Song of Defense...
9644,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Riehlvelt protects himself with two \Nwhips moving at ridiculous speed, while he awaits his opportunity to strike."
9645,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You planned to attack first and take the lead.
9646,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Too bad it didn't work...
9647,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Now that I've switched to this stance, you have no chance of winning."
9648,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Why not?
9649,Power x To x Avenge!,34,That should be obvious.
9650,Power x To x Avenge!,34,A normal person can't even see the whips move!
9651,Power x To x Avenge!,34,And this small ring offers no \Nmeans to hide or escape.
9652,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Take this!
9653,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Sorry, but I'm not a normal person."
9654,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What?!
9655,Power x To x Avenge!,34,But...
9656,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Thunder Snake!
9657,Power x To x Avenge!,34,True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake
9658,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"I'm astonished, Killua."
9659,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You're the first person I've fought who could see my whips move.
9660,Power x To x Avenge!,34,So I have a present for you...
9661,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Together, my whips carry a \None million volt current."
9662,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Enough to paralyze and \Nincapacitate the largest of men.
9663,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Any fool who resists my whips will fall prey to Thunder Snake!
9664,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'm accustomed to electrical currents from the torture training I've endured.
9665,Power x To x Avenge!,34,It has no effect on me.
9666,Power x To x Avenge!,34,But that just means I can bear the pain.
9667,Power x To x Avenge!,34,It still hurts.
9668,Power x To x Avenge!,34,That's why I'm a little pissed.
9669,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you fall from that height, you'll die!"
9670,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What do you want?
9671,Power x To x Avenge!,34,P-Please catch me!
9672,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Okay.
9673,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Just come to me.
9674,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?"
9675,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.
9676,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Our winner is Killua!
9677,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Nice, Killua!"
9678,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You're up next.
9679,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You're fighting him in six days?
9680,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Uh-huh, June 10th."
9681,Power x To x Avenge!,34,My win was only possible \Nbecause of who I am...
9682,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"If you're hit by those electric whips, you'll be knocked out cold."
9683,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Yeah.
9684,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What's your plan?
9685,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Don't worry. I have an idea.
9686,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Oh?
9687,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"In spirit, you were fighting \Neven as you watched me."
9688,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I guess you prefer actual combat \Nto being a spectator.
9689,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 9th
9690,Power x To x Avenge!,34,It appears that the damage
9691,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Gido suffered in his match \Nwith Gon was so severe, he hasn't returned for today's fight."
9692,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Killua wins by default.
9693,Power x To x Avenge!,34,June 10th
9694,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"After losing to Killua,"
9695,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3, \Nleaving him no more chances."
9696,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"As you know, after four losses, \Nyou're out of the contest."
9697,Power x To x Avenge!,34,You'll have to start over from the beginning.
9698,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"He appears wary of Gon's speed, as he already has his whips out."
9699,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod..."
9700,Power x To x Avenge!,34,How does he plan to fight?
9701,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Begin!
9702,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!"
9703,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!
9704,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Oh, Gon is squatting?"
9705,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Amazing...
9706,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He pried a floor tile loose by himself!
9707,Power x To x Avenge!,34,And then he threw it!
9708,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Aura Burst!
9709,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Whoa, he barely managed to escape!"
9710,Power x To x Avenge!,34,He left that escape route open on purpose.
9711,Power x To x Avenge!,34,What?
9712,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"However, Gon has already anticipated him."
9713,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"When you try to escape, \Nevery fraction of a second counts."
9714,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"And since there isn't time to change direction, you're forced to move forward..."
9715,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"And when you dash quickly, \Nyou're usually off-balance."
9716,Power x To x Avenge!,34,His only option is to stop the whips.
9717,Power x To x Avenge!,34,That's where you get him...
9718,Power x To x Avenge!,34,This is the switch?
9719,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Let's see...
9720,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I'll turn the power to maximum.
9721,Power x To x Avenge!,34,S-Stop...
9722,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Switch
9723,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Stop it! on!
9724,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Just kidding.
9725,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.
9726,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Our winner is Gon!
9727,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gon-san!
9728,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Yes, that truly was impressive."
9729,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I can see the progress you've made from these last two fights.
9730,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Feel free to pick a time and place...
9731,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I shall be your opponent.
9732,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Hisoka has recognized the strength
9733,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Gon demonstrated during his matches.
9734,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Their fight will soon begin.

9747,Power x To x Avenge!,34,I wonder how many of her there are.
9748,Power x To x Avenge!,34,"Uh, there's just one!"
9749,Power x To x Avenge!,34,Next time: The x True x Pass!

9788,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0 and there are six distinct categories.
9789,The x True x Pass!,35,Enhancer
9790,The x True x Pass!,35,Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.
9791,The x True x Pass!,35,Emitter
9792,The x True x Pass!,35,Emitters can propel their aura.
9793,The x True x Pass!,35,Transmuter
9794,The x True x Pass!,35,Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.
9795,The x True x Pass!,35,Conjurer
9796,The x True x Pass!,35,Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
9797,The x True x Pass!,35,Manipulator
9798,The x True x Pass!,35,Manipulators can use their aura \Nto control objects and creatures.
9799,The x True x Pass!,35,Specialist
9800,The x True x Pass!,35,Specialists are those with a \Nspecial aura that doesn't fall within the other five classes.
9801,The x True x Pass!,35,The key is to find the power that suits you.
9802,The x True x Pass!,35,Enhancer \NEmitter \NTransmuter \NConjurer \NManipulator \NSpecialist
9803,The x True x Pass!,35,The power that suits you?
9804,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0 with two areas of particular prominence.
9805,The x True x Pass!,35,The first would be your natural potential.
9806,The x True x Pass!,35,The second would be potential \Nrefined later in life.
9807,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon-kun, for example, was born with a flexible, springy body."
9808,The x True x Pass!,35,His acute senses were the product \Nof a childhood spent in nature.
9809,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0 falls within one of the six categories.
9810,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0
9811,The x True x Pass!,35,"If you attempt to learn an ability that does not fit your inclination, you will find it very difficult."
9812,The x True x Pass!,35,Act
9813,The x True x Pass!,35,Enhancer
9814,The x True x Pass!,35,Transmuter \NConjurer
9815,The x True x Pass!,35,\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\N\NSpecialist
9816,The x True x Pass!,35,Emitter \NManipulator
9817,The x True x Pass!,35,This hexagon depicts the relationship among the six categories.
9818,The x True x Pass!,35,"The closer a class is to your own, the higher your compatibility to learn it."
9819,The x True x Pass!,35,"If you are born with an aura of the Enhancer category, you will find Enhancer abilities easiest to learn and master."
9820,The x True x Pass!,35,And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes will also be easy to learn.
9821,The x True x Pass!,35,"On the other hand, the Specialist class, which is furthest away, would be difficult."
9822,The x True x Pass!,35,"To illustrate, I'll use skills \Nthat you've seen for yourselves."
9823,The x True x Pass!,35,Hisoka was able to change his aura into a rubbery substance.
9824,The x True x Pass!,35,This would be a Transmuter ability.
9825,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gido used his tops and body as \Nweapons by making them spin faster, which would be an Enhancer power."
9826,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, since using so many tops as weapons also requires Manipulator skill, \Nhe wasn't as successful."
9827,The x True x Pass!,35,"As for Kastro, his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong."
9828,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0
9829,The x True x Pass!,35,I believe that his aura fell \Ninto the Enhancer class.
9830,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, he focused his energy on \Nthe power to create a double, which is a Conjurer skill."
9831,The x True x Pass!,35,And he also required a Manipulator \Nability to control the double.
9832,The x True x Pass!,35,Both of those are relatively far from the Enhancer category.
9833,The x True x Pass!,35,So neither was compatible \Nwith an Enhancer type?
9834,The x True x Pass!,35,"Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and natural talent to learn an incompatible ability."
9835,The x True x Pass!,35,"And as a result,"
9836,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0
9837,The x True x Pass!,35,So he made the wrong choice.
9838,The x True x Pass!,35,He was a great fighter...
9839,The x True x Pass!,35,It's a shame.
9840,The x True x Pass!,35,Well?
9841,The x True x Pass!,35,Do you see the importance of understanding your own \Nauras and inclinations?
9842,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu!
9843,The x True x Pass!,35,"Given that, is there any way to learn which \Ncategory your aura falls into?"
9844,The x True x Pass!,35,There is.
9845,The x True x Pass!,35,"Water Divination, a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura."
9846,The x True x Pass!,35,Hatsu{\i0
9847,The x True x Pass!,35,Ren{\i0
9848,The x True x Pass!,35,The result will reveal your category.
9849,The x True x Pass!,35,The water's overflowing...
9850,The x True x Pass!,35,"If the amount of water changes, that means you are an Enhancer."
9851,The x True x Pass!,35,This shows that my aura falls \Nwithin the Enhancer class.
9852,The x True x Pass!,35,"Okay, now it's your turn."
9853,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon's an Enhancer, too?"
9854,The x True x Pass!,35,The leaf moved!
9855,The x True x Pass!,35,"If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator."
9856,The x True x Pass!,35,"Okay, I'm last!"
9857,The x True x Pass!,35,Nothing's happening.
9858,The x True x Pass!,35,Indeed...
9859,The x True x Pass!,35,The leaf isn't moving.
9860,The x True x Pass!,35,Do I not have any potential?
9861,The x True x Pass!,35,Not at all.
9862,The x True x Pass!,35,Taste the water.
9863,The x True x Pass!,35,Taste it?
9864,The x True x Pass!,35,It might be a little sweet...
9865,The x True x Pass!,35,You're right.
9866,The x True x Pass!,35,"Yes, it's a bit sweet."
9867,The x True x Pass!,35,Isn't this just water?
9868,The x True x Pass!,35,It's just water.
9869,The x True x Pass!,35,But the taste changed.
9870,The x True x Pass!,35,Because of Killua-kun's aura.
9871,The x True x Pass!,35,And that means?
9872,The x True x Pass!,35,You are a Transmuter.
9873,The x True x Pass!,35,Oh!
9874,The x True x Pass!,35,A Transmuter?
9875,The x True x Pass!,35,"Now, you three know how your auras are classified."
9876,The x True x Pass!,35,"Use the next four weeks to train hard, so the Water Divination \Nresults become more pronounced."
9877,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu!
9878,The x True x Pass!,35,June 11th
9879,The x True x Pass!,35,June 16th
9880,The x True x Pass!,35,June 20th
9881,The x True x Pass!,35,Hello?
9882,The x True x Pass!,35,This is Gon.
9883,The x True x Pass!,35,"Ah, I have been waiting..."
9884,The x True x Pass!,35,Have you decided when we should fight?
9885,The x True x Pass!,35,"Yeah, July 10th."
9886,The x True x Pass!,35,That's the day!
9887,The x True x Pass!,35,Okay.
9888,The x True x Pass!,35,I can hardly wait...
9889,The x True x Pass!,35,June 22nd
9890,The x True x Pass!,35,June 30th
9891,The x True x Pass!,35,July 5th
9892,The x True x Pass!,35,"Now, show me what you've \Naccomplished with your training."
9893,The x True x Pass!,35,"Killua-kun, you're first."
9894,The x True x Pass!,35,Okay.
9895,The x True x Pass!,35,I'm done.
9896,The x True x Pass!,35,It's sweet!
9897,The x True x Pass!,35,"Wow, it tastes like honey."
9898,The x True x Pass!,35,Excellent.
9899,The x True x Pass!,35,"Zushi, you're next."
9900,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu!
9901,The x True x Pass!,35,This is the best I can manage...
9902,The x True x Pass!,35,That's fine.
9903,The x True x Pass!,35,But it won't be enough to pass.
9904,The x True x Pass!,35,You'll need to train some more.
9905,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu.
9906,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon-kun, you're next."
9907,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu!
9908,The x True x Pass!,35,Stop...
9909,The x True x Pass!,35,"Stop, Gon-kun!"
9910,The x True x Pass!,35,"The water increased with so \Nmuch force, it cracked the glass."
9911,The x True x Pass!,35,Honestly...
9912,The x True x Pass!,35,You really are something.
9913,The x True x Pass!,35,I was feeling pretty good about this.
9914,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon-kun, Killua-kun."
9915,The x True x Pass!,35,Today is your graduation day.
9916,The x True x Pass!,35,Huh?
9917,The x True x Pass!,35,Really?
9918,The x True x Pass!,35,"We did it, Killua!"
9919,The x True x Pass!,35,Yeah.
9920,The x True x Pass!,35,"Master, what about me?"
9921,The x True x Pass!,35,You still need to train a bit more.
9922,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu.
9923,The x True x Pass!,35,Keep at it.
9924,The x True x Pass!,35,You can do it!
9925,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu...
9926,The x True x Pass!,35,"And, Gon-kun..."
9927,The x True x Pass!,35,Huh?
9928,The x True x Pass!,35,I have something important to tell you.
9929,The x True x Pass!,35,Something important?
9930,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed \Nthe Secret Hunter Exam!"
9931,The x True x Pass!,35,Huh?
9932,The x True x Pass!,35,You've passed.
9933,The x True x Pass!,35,Congratulations.
9934,The x True x Pass!,35,The Secret Hunter Exam?
9935,The x True x Pass!,35,Correct.
9936,The x True x Pass!,35,You were able to pass.
9937,The x True x Pass!,35,What do you mean?
9938,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0 as professional Hunters are \Nexpected to be exceptionally strong.
9939,The x True x Pass!,35,One of your basic tasks as a Hunter will be apprehending \Nevil poachers and criminals.
9940,The x True x Pass!,35,You must be strong enough to fight crime.
9941,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, this power is highly \Ndestructive when used for wrongdoing."
9942,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0
9943,The x True x Pass!,35,"Therefore, the test is only administered to \Nthose who pass the public Exam."
9944,The x True x Pass!,35,"Oh, so you were going to teach us, or at least Gon, all along..."
9945,The x True x Pass!,35,Yes.
9946,The x True x Pass!,35,I should mention that the \Nhead Shingen-ryu master is Chairman Netero.
9947,The x True x Pass!,35,The master has told me much about you.
9948,The x True x Pass!,35,That old man...
9949,The x True x Pass!,35,Killua-kun.
9950,The x True x Pass!,35,Please take the Hunter Exam again.
9951,The x True x Pass!,35,You will definitely pass next time.
9952,The x True x Pass!,35,Huh?
9953,The x True x Pass!,35,Yeah.
9954,The x True x Pass!,35,You are more than qualified.
9955,The x True x Pass!,35,I guarantee it.
9956,The x True x Pass!,35,"Yeah, if I feel up to it."
9957,The x True x Pass!,35,"Hey, Wing-san..."
9958,The x True x Pass!,35,Have you heard anything about \Nthe others who passed?
9959,The x True x Pass!,35,Sure.
9960,The x True x Pass!,35,Hanzo and Kurapika
9961,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0
9962,The x True x Pass!,35,Ren{\i0
9963,The x True x Pass!,35,Leorio has begun studying for \Nthe medical school exam.
9964,The x True x Pass!,35,Nen{\i0 so they were qualified.
9965,The x True x Pass!,35,Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.
9966,The x True x Pass!,35,Yeah.
9967,The x True x Pass!,35,"Now, Gon-kun,"
9968,The x True x Pass!,35,I have one warning for you.
9969,The x True x Pass!,35,"When you fight Hisoka tomorrow, don't push yourself too hard."
9970,The x True x Pass!,35,All right?
9971,The x True x Pass!,35,"Yes, sir!"
9972,The x True x Pass!,35,"Zushi, you will continue \Ntraining for four more weeks."
9973,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu...
9974,The x True x Pass!,35,You should have more confidence.
9975,The x True x Pass!,35,You are progressing at an incredible pace.
9976,The x True x Pass!,35,You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.
9977,The x True x Pass!,35,One in a hundred thousand?
9978,The x True x Pass!,35,O-Osu!
9979,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, those two are one-in-ten-million talents."
9980,The x True x Pass!,35,Osu!
9981,The x True x Pass!,35,"That doesn't make me feel any better, master..."
9982,The x True x Pass!,35,But...
9983,The x True x Pass!,35,"One day,"
9984,The x True x Pass!,35,I will definitely catch up!
9985,The x True x Pass!,35,"Hello, everyone!"
9986,The x True x Pass!,35,"In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka."
9987,The x True x Pass!,35,This is the fight you've all been waiting for.
9988,The x True x Pass!,35,"As you can see, the stands are packed."
9989,The x True x Pass!,35,The tension in the air before the \Nstart of this match is almost unreal!
9990,The x True x Pass!,35,How much longer?
9991,The x True x Pass!,35,Get this thing started!
9992,The x True x Pass!,35,Gon is the first to arrive!
9993,The x True x Pass!,35,"After four fights, he has a 3-1 record."
9994,The x True x Pass!,35,He's on a roll!
9995,The x True x Pass!,35,"You can do it, Gon!"
9996,The x True x Pass!,35,Don't you need your fishing rod?
9997,The x True x Pass!,35,You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!
9998,The x True x Pass!,35,"And next, with a fiery display..."
9999,The x True x Pass!,35,Hisoka appears!
10000,The x True x Pass!,35,His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh in everyone's minds.
10001,The x True x Pass!,35,His record is 9-3.
10002,The x True x Pass!,35,"If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master."
10003,The x True x Pass!,35,"If he loses, he falls all the way down."
10004,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, he has yet to lose \Nwhen he steps into the ring!"
10005,The x True x Pass!,35,Will his undefeated record continue?
10006,The x True x Pass!,35,Oh...
10007,The x True x Pass!,35,Don't look at me like that.
10008,The x True x Pass!,35,Schwing
10009,The x True x Pass!,35,I'm getting turned on.
10010,The x True x Pass!,35,What a sinister aura.
10011,The x True x Pass!,35,"Gon-kun, don't overdo it."
10012,The x True x Pass!,35,Points and KO system.
10013,The x True x Pass!,35,No time limit!
10014,The x True x Pass!,35,One round!
10015,The x True x Pass!,35,Begin!
10016,The x True x Pass!,35,This is the match you've been waiting for.
10017,The x True x Pass!,35,The die has been cast!
10018,The x True x Pass!,35,Who will make the first move?
10019,The x True x Pass!,35,It's Gon!
10020,The x True x Pass!,35,A clean hit!
10021,The x True x Pass!,35,One point to Hisoka!
10022,The x True x Pass!,35,Wh-What an intense exchange.
10023,The x True x Pass!,35,I never even got to sneak in a word!
10024,The x True x Pass!,35,What's wrong?
10025,The x True x Pass!,35,I still haven't moved a step from where I started.
10026,The x True x Pass!,35,Huh? Really?
10027,The x True x Pass!,35,Damn!
10028,The x True x Pass!,35,Just you wait!
10029,The x True x Pass!,35,"Okay, I don't have to try to \Nhit him with every attack."
10030,The x True x Pass!,35,I can use some feints to get the same effect.
10031,The x True x Pass!,35,Hisoka's enjoying himself.
10032,The x True x Pass!,35,"In terms of actual skill, \Nthere's an insurmountable gap."
10033,The x True x Pass!,35,But he still has a weakness.
10034,The x True x Pass!,35,"Hisoka knows that he's stronger, so he won't retreat."
10035,The x True x Pass!,35,That gives Gon an opening!
10036,The x True x Pass!,35,"In that case, I'll try that!"
10037,The x True x Pass!,35,There it is!
10038,The x True x Pass!,35,Gon's Stone Flip!
10039,The x True x Pass!,35,He shattered the block to \Ncreate a hail of rubble.
10040,The x True x Pass!,35,Gon...
10041,The x True x Pass!,35,Where is he?
10042,The x True x Pass!,35,Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.
10043,The x True x Pass!,35,"However, he will soon receive a taste of Hisoka's true power."

10079,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Don't look at me like that.

10081,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'm getting turned on.
10082,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick
10083,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon was able to land a solid \Npunch to Hisoka's face.
10084,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Will he be able to win the match?
10085,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Critical!
10086,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Two points for Gon!
10087,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Amazing! Gon managed \Nto land a critical hit!
10088,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.
10089,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon is on top!
10090,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"However, it appears that his punch hasn't \Ndealt much damage to Hisoka."
10091,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I have to question the referee's decision...
10092,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,The referee is entitled to award \Npoints as he pleases.
10093,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Huh?
10094,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Some referees award points based \Non the amount of damage done, while some base scores on \Nstrategy and technique."
10095,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I believe the referee in this case \Nwas rewarding the fighter for using the stone block in his attack.
10096,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I see...
10097,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"So, who are you?"
10098,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Okay!
10099,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,O-Oh...
10100,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"For the first time in this fight, \NHisoka has moved!"
10101,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,And he's smiling ever so slightly.
10102,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Is he finally getting serious?
10103,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What was that about?!
10104,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I have no idea!
10105,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,How much have you learned
10106,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Nen{\i0
10107,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,All of the basics.
10108,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I see.
10109,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You must be an Enhancer.
10110,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,H-How did you know?
10111,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You're so adorable...
10112,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You should do a better job \Nof keeping a secret.
10113,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Shut up!
10114,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,How did you know?
10115,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I used a method similar to the \Nblood type personality test.
10116,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,And it's just as unreliable.
10117,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I devised my own way of using \Npersonality to classify aura.
10118,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Enhancers are simple and earnest.
10119,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He nailed it.
10120,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's right.
10121,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"By the way, I'm a Transmuter, fickle and dishonest."
10122,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It fits.
10123,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He nailed it.
10124,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Emitters have short tempers.
10125,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Specialists are independent.
10126,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Conjurers are high-strung.
10127,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Manipulators are argumentative.
10128,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,The two of us are quite compatible.
10129,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Our opposing personalities attract.
10130,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,We could become very intimate.
10131,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"But you should take care, \Nbecause Transmuters are fickle."
10132,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It takes a mere second for \Ntreasure to turn to trash.
10133,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,So...
10134,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Do not disappoint me, Gon."
10135,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's fast!
10136,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Wh-What a strong kick.
10137,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He sent that stone block flying \Nall the way to the entrance!
10138,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Fast, fast, fast!"
10139,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.
10140,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Critical for Hisoka!
10141,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Add points.
10142,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,3-2!
10143,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored as a critical strike.
10144,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's regained the lead.
10145,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon appears to be confused...
10146,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Does he have no way to fight back?
10147,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's backing off.
10148,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Amazing...
10149,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Too amazing.
10150,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What's wrong?
10151,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Attack me.
10152,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Forget it. \NI'm brainstorming!
10153,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"I can just barely follow him by eye, but the rest of my body can't keep up."
10154,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!"
10155,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Very well.
10156,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Then I'll have to force you \Nto come over here...
10157,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gyo{\i0
10158,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Crap!
10159,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Do you understand what is happening?
10160,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!
10161,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,This is my Elastic Love...
10162,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Also known as Bungee Gum.
10163,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It can expand and contract.
10164,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,And attach and detach as I desire...
10165,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You won't be able to escape.
10166,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Critical and down.
10167,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Plus three points to Hisoka.
10168,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,6-2!
10169,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!
10170,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon is down!
10171,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He turns his aura into a rubbery substance capable of attaching to other objects.
10172,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Bungee Gum.
10173,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Tsk.
10174,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.
10175,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Stand up, Gon..."
10176,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Damn.
10177,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,The score is 6-2.
10178,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hisoka increases his lead.
10179,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Will his undefeated record continue?
10180,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Stand up, kid!"
10181,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!"
10182,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You can do it!
10183,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Can you fight?
10184,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Of course.
10185,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Oh, Gon is standing..."
10186,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,But he's sustained significant damage!
10187,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Okay, I have a question for you."
10188,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Huh?
10189,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit."
10190,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What?
10191,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?
10192,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When did he attach his Gum?
10193,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,One...
10194,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When I elbowed you.
10195,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Two...
10196,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When I landed a clean hit.
10197,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Three...
10198,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When I landed a critical strike?
10199,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When was it?
10200,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Three! When you hit me with both hands!
10201,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Wrong!
10202,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,The answer is four.
10203,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,When I was giving you my \Naura personality analysis.
10204,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,That's dirty!
10205,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Damn.
10206,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...
10207,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Now, I have a warning for you."
10208,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gyo{\i0 you would have been able to notice my aura, and you could have avoided it during my aura personality analysis."
10209,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"However, what about situations \None, two, and three?"
10210,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Have you figured it out?
10211,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I could have also attached my Bungee Gum while directly attacking you.
10212,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You only need to conceal your aura when you \Nwish to catch your opponent off guard.
10213,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Normally, you use your aura while attacking."
10214,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It doesn't matter if your \Nopponent sees your aura when you're landing attacks.
10215,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's right.
10216,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks, using Gyo to see his aura won't help!"
10217,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,This is bad.
10218,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,His power's far more difficult to \Nhandle than I expected!
10219,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.
10220,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,But if you're able to defend...
10221,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"No, defending won't work."
10222,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Even if you block, he can still attach \Nhis aura to the part you block with."
10223,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I can't escape.
10224,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What should I do?
10225,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Okay, that's enough talk."
10226,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Let us prepare for battle.
10227,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Resume.
10228,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If I can't escape,"
10229,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'll go to him!
10230,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon...
10231,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon!
10232,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Good...
10233,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You're so good.
10234,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Those eyes.
10235,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,That look.
10236,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,That spirit...
10237,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I can't wait to break you.
10238,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,But not yet...
10239,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,More...
10240,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,More!
10241,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.
10242,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
10243,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Once you've matured...
10244,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
10245,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Until you've reached soaring new heights...
10246,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I must wait.
10247,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,A vicious rush!
10248,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Oh, not again!"
10249,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hisoka draws Gon into another \Npunch from his left fist!
10250,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Good.
10251,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I managed to block that!
10252,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'm getting used to being dragged \Naround by his Bungee Gum.
10253,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,This isn't over.
10254,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It's not over yet!
10255,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'm scared...
10256,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"But if I let my fear overcome me,"
10257,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'll never be able to beat anyone else!
10258,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Critical for both sides!
10259,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Plus two points!
10260,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!
10261,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What?
10262,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka, \Nand 4 points for Gon!"
10263,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I was never knocked down!
10264,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I got right back up!
10265,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I even blocked his attack!
10266,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What?
10267,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Something's wrong with this ref!
10268,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Are you blind?
10269,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Oh, we have another strange call."
10270,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"In response to the ref's decision, the crowd has filled the arena with boos."
10271,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Fight!
10272,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If he gets ten points, I lose."
10273,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I only have one point left.
10274,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He doesn't need to knock me down.
10275,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If I get hit by any attack, it's over!"
10276,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"You must be more vigilant, Gon."
10277,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Look to the right.
10278,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Oh, sorry."
10279,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I meant my right.
10280,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Down, and clean hit!"
10281,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Plus two points.
10282,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,11-4.
10283,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"The winner, by, TKO, is..."
10284,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hisoka!
10285,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Huh?
10286,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"While you were complaining to the referee,"
10287,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.
10288,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka, \Nand 4 points for Gon!"
10289,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.
10290,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,So...
10291,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It's really over?
10292,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You've made incredible progress.
10293,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,But you lack experience.
10294,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"About ten more fights, and you \Nshould stand a better chance."
10295,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If we're in Heavens Arena, at least."
10296,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Therefore,"
10297,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I will not fight you here again.
10298,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Next time, we'll fight in the real world, \Nwithout any rules to restrain us."
10299,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,With our lives on the line.
10300,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's so far away...
10301,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,But he's not out of reach.
10302,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I need more training in Nen...
10303,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!
10304,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"With this victory, Hisoka has \Nearned his tenth win and the right to challenge a Floor Master!"
10305,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon has fought bravely, and we wish \Nhim the best in his next match."
10306,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,So that's all for now.
10307,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!"
10308,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.
10309,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"But given today's matchup,"
10310,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"I thought it prudent to end the fight as quickly as possible, even if it meant lowering my standards."
10311,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,So he's a technical ref.
10312,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What does that mean?
10313,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"If a ref believes that a \Nfight may get dangerous, he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly."
10314,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You have to take that into \Nconsideration when placing a bet.
10315,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0..."
10316,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I have nothing to say to you \Nabout the fight with Hisoka.
10317,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"You were the one fighting him, \Nso I'm sure you understand best of all."
10318,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Understand what?
10319,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,What he learned from that fight.
10320,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Yes!
10321,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon, what did you learn?"
10322,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,A secret.
10323,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon-kun, Killua-kun..."
10324,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Nen{\i0 as you continue down your chosen paths.
10325,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Yes!
10326,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Yeah.
10327,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'm glad I was able to meet you.
10328,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!
10329,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You think you can pass us?
10330,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"One day, for sure!"
10331,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Won't happen.
10332,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi."
10333,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Osu!
10334,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Well, let's go."
10335,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Yeah.
10336,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Thank you for everything, Wing-san!"
10337,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Yeah, same here."
10338,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Thank you.
10339,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Take care, you two."
10340,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Zushi, until we meet again!"
10341,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Osu!
10342,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Well, you finally accomplished \Nyour objective, right?"
10343,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Uh-huh.
10344,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Then we don't have any more business here.
10345,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon, what are you going to do?"
10346,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Go back to Whale Island.
10347,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Whale Island?
10348,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Uh-huh.
10349,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"I was able to return the favor to Hisoka, so I want to go back to the island, \Nand show Mito-san my license."
10350,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It's been over half a year since I left...
10351,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I guess I'll come with you.
10352,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Huh?
10353,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,I'd like to meet Mito-san.
10354,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Really?
10355,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Then let's go together.
10356,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Yeah, I'll just tag along."
10357,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Bye-bye, Heavens Arena."
10358,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka and return the tag, as he'd promised."
10359,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Despite losing the fight,"
10360,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.
10361,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
10362,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
10363,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
10364,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hunterpedia!
10365,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,It's Gon and Killua's
10366,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Hunterpedia!
10367,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
10368,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Today, we introduce..."
10369,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Gon!
10370,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon learned that he still \Nhas a ways to go,"
10371,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Me?
10372,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Gon became my first friend, after we met during the Hunter Exam. but he also met his goal of \Nrepaying an old debt."
10373,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"He's fun to be around because his expressions are always changing,"
10374,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,He's intent on getting stronger. and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.
10375,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,Next time: Ging x And x Gon!
10376,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?"
10377,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,"I-I-I can't do much, \Nbut thank you for letting me stay!"
10378,A Big Debt x And x A Small Kick!,36,You're stuttering.
10379,Ging x And x Gon!,37,He's so far away...
10380,Ging x And x Gon!,37,But he's not out of reach.
10381,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I need more training in Nen...
10382,Ging x And x Gon!,37,To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!
10383,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mito-san!
10384,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mito-san!
10385,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mito-san!
10386,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Gon...
10387,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Gon!
10388,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mito-san!
10389,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"I'm home, Mito-san."
10390,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Welcome home, Gon."
10391,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"You must be Killua, right?"
10392,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging x And x Gon
10393,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Sheesh, you should have let me know \Nyou were coming home."
10394,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I didn't have time to prepare anything.
10395,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"It's not a big deal, whatever is fine."
10396,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What are you saying?
10397,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Your friend came all the \Nway out here to visit.
10398,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"No, it's okay."
10399,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Honestly, you should have \Nsaid something first..."
10400,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Are you listening to me?
10401,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, that's right..."
10402,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Take a bath while I make \Nsomething to eat.
10403,Ging x And x Gon!,37,And put out your dirty clothes.
10404,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'll be doing laundry.
10405,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Okay, later."
10406,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Now!
10407,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You have ten seconds!
10408,Ging x And x Gon!,37,One.
10409,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Two.
10410,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Three.
10411,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Is she always like this?
10412,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Four.
10413,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Five.
10414,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Pretty much.
10415,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Six.
10416,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Let's move fast!
10417,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Seven.
10418,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Eight.
10419,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Nine.
10420,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yeah, this is the life..."
10421,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Okay, let's eat."
10422,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Wow!
10423,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This looks delicious.
10424,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What are you doing?
10425,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Offering our thanks.
10426,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What does that mean?
10427,Ging x And x Gon!,37,All right...
10428,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Let's dig in.
10429,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Please help yourself, Killua."
10430,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Right.
10431,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, right, Mito-san."
10432,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Look!
10433,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This is a Hunter License.
10434,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Hmm...
10435,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It looks pretty normal.
10436,Ging x And x Gon!,37,There.
10437,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Hey, what are you doing?"
10438,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Just kidding...
10439,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I would never do anything like that.
10440,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Man, what if it doesn't work anymore?"
10441,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Mito-san, I'm going to show \NKillua around the island."
10442,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Won't that take a while?
10443,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Want me to pack some food for you?
10444,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's okay!
10445,Ging x And x Gon!,37,We'll find something to eat in the forest.
10446,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Gon and his friend are rather late.
10447,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It's been a while since he \Nwas last on this island.
10448,Ging x And x Gon!,37,And he's brought his first friend along.
10449,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'm sure they won't be back until it's late.
10450,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You're right...
10451,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Maybe I should take some \Nfood out to them.
10452,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Hey, Gon."
10453,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What are you going to do now?
10454,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"For now, I'll rest up here while I gather information..."
10455,Ging x And x Gon!,37,The information I'll need before I go  \Nto Yorknew to look for my dad.
10456,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Oh...
10457,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What should I do?
10458,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Huh?
10459,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You should stay here and then \Ngo to Yorknew with me!
10460,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yeah, I'm coming with you."
10461,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That wasn't what I meant.
10462,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I was thinking you're sort of admirable.
10463,Ging x And x Gon!,37,There's nothing I really want to do...
10464,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I don't really have anything \NI want to do like you do.
10465,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Though there are plenty of \Nthings I don't want to do.
10466,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I don't want to stay in that house...
10467,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Or inherit the family business.
10468,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I guess I'm a little jealous.
10469,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Killua...
10470,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I think it's fun to be with you.
10471,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Wh-What's that about?
10472,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Whale Island is a place for fishermen to stay \Nduring extended outings.
10473,Ging x And x Gon!,37,There aren't too many native residents.
10474,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"There's one other kid here that's \Naround my age, and she's a girl."
10475,Ging x And x Gon!,37,So you're my first friend who's the same age.
10476,Ging x And x Gon!,37,My situation was similar...
10477,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Stuck in that house all day.
10478,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I spent all my time learning how to kill.
10479,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You were my first friend.
10480,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Do you have fun when we're together?
10481,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"I guess, yeah."
10482,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Then let's stick together!
10483,Ging x And x Gon!,37,We can travel around and \Nsee the world together!
10484,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Don't you ever feel embarrassed \Nsaying that stuff?
10485,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'll be looking for my dad.
10486,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You'll be looking for what you want to do.
10487,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It'll be a blast!
10488,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Yeah.
10489,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Doesn't sound too bad.
10490,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Okay!
10491,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'll help you look for your dad until \NI discover what I want to do!
10492,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Okay!
10493,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, what's your mom doing?"
10494,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"It's hard asking about my dad, \Nbut asking about my mom is even harder."
10495,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Since Mito-san raised me by herself, it would feel wrong to ask her that..."
10496,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Is that how it works?
10497,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"At first, Mito-san told me my parents died in a traffic accident."
10498,Ging x And x Gon!,37,She was worried that I \Nmight end up like my dad if I learned he was alive and a Hunter...
10499,Ging x And x Gon!,37,And she was right.
10500,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"When I found out about my dad,"
10501,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I kind of figured that my \Nmom was probably dead.
10502,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's pretty harsh!
10503,Ging x And x Gon!,37,So I've always thought of Mito-san as my mom.
10504,Ging x And x Gon!,37,She's the only mom I have.
10505,Ging x And x Gon!,37,So there's nothing for me to ask.
10506,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I don't need to.
10507,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I see.
10508,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Man,"
10509,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...
10510,Ging x And x Gon!,37,She's the best!
10511,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Though she does nag a lot.
10512,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's nothing...
10513,Ging x And x Gon!,37,My mom starts crying the second \NI say I want to go outside!
10514,Ging x And x Gon!,37,She actually goes into hysterics!
10515,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Say...
10516,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What?
10517,Ging x And x Gon!,37,How long will you be staying?
10518,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Maybe a month?
10519,Ging x And x Gon!,37,After that...
10520,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'm going to look for my dad.
10521,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What's this?
10522,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Something Ging left with me.
10523,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Huh?
10524,Ging x And x Gon!,37,He asked me to give this to you \Nwhen you became a Hunter.
10525,Ging x And x Gon!,37,My dad left this for me...
10526,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I'll tell you everything I know about Ging.
10527,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging is my cousin.
10528,Ging x And x Gon!,37,My oldest memory of him is of his back.
10529,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I was always running after him.
10530,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"I think back then, I was three..."
10531,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I have the feeling that I was \Nalways looking at his back.
10532,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"At age twelve, Ging left the \Nisland to take the Hunter Exam, just like you did."
10533,Ging x And x Gon!,37,He suddenly said that \Nhe was leaving the island.
10534,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"When I asked him why, he told me this..."
10535,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"""There's something that I want."""
10536,Ging x And x Gon!,37,He never told me what it \Nwas that he wanted.
10537,Ging x And x Gon!,37,We argued...
10538,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Actually, it was just me making a fuss."
10539,Ging x And x Gon!,37,But I never got to see Ging again \Nbefore he left the island.
10540,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"You were originally told that your parents died in a \Ntraffic accident, right?"
10541,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That was what happened to Mito's parents.
10542,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It happened right after Ging left the island.
10543,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"After that,"
10544,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging's father went missing on a fishing trip.
10545,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Both of my sons ended up passing away.
10546,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Yes...
10547,Ging x And x Gon!,37,All that happened after he left.
10548,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Ten years later, Ging returned to the island."
10549,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"When he returned, he came carrying you, and you were still a baby."
10550,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"He just popped up, out of nowhere."
10551,Ging x And x Gon!,37,And he asked us to take care of you.
10552,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"When I asked about your mother, \Nhe'd only say that they were separated."
10553,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"I was about to agree to look after you, \Nwhen I heard a loud,"
10554,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"""Don't be silly!"""
10555,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I imagine everyone on the island heard it.
10556,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Grandma, you don't need to mention that!"
10557,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Anyhow, I knew we couldn't \Ncount on him to raise you."
10558,Ging x And x Gon!,37,So we don't know anything \Nabout your mother.
10559,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Mito even yelled,"
10560,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"""Don't you ever come back!"" \Nwhile she cried..."
10561,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Grandma!
10562,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Anyway, Ging left this with us then."
10563,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This girl's tried to throw it away \Nso many times...
10564,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's because you always \Nput it back where it was!
10565,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"If you wanted to get rid of it, you should have buried or burned it, \Nrather than tossing it in the trash can."
10566,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Do you understand?
10567,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's it.
10568,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That's all I know about Ging.
10569,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging...
10570,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Ging, huh?"
10571,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging... Ging...
10572,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yeah, I'll use that."
10573,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Hey, Mito-san..."
10574,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Tell me more about what Ging was like when he was little!
10575,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Huh?
10576,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Does it sound weird for me \Nto use his name?
10577,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Somehow, it feels more natural."
10578,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"No, that isn't it."
10579,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You want to hear what Ging \Nwas like as a child?
10580,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Yeah!
10581,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Hey, did Ging have any friends his age?"
10582,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"No, he didn't."
10583,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging and I were the only children around.
10584,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"So I always wanted him to play with me, but he would always run off."
10585,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You were always getting lost.
10586,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Honestly, you only remember \Nthe embarrassing stuff!"
10587,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"You followed Ging into the mountains, but then you didn't come back."
10588,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"When Ging returned by himself, the whole village panicked. \NAnd that happened several times."
10589,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"But when we went to look \Nfor you in the mountains,"
10590,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging was always the first to find you.
10591,Ging x And x Gon!,37,No matter where you hid...
10592,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"After a few times, people started wondering if you \Ntwo were just playing pranks."
10593,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What?!
10594,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I would never do that!
10595,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Well, you always hid in places that were impossible to locate."
10596,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It was like you didn't want to be found.
10597,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Really?
10598,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I guess so...
10599,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, that reminds me of this other time."
10600,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging and I were...
10601,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Oh?
10602,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I see.
10603,Ging x And x Gon!,37,So this is the box.
10604,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Huh?
10605,Ging x And x Gon!,37,How do you open it?
10606,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yeah, I tried a bunch of methods, but it wouldn't open."
10607,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mind if I use force?
10608,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Go ahead.
10609,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Okay...
10610,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It's no use.
10611,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This is no ordinary box.
10612,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I should be able to twist \Nopen an ordinary steel box.
10613,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"And since we don't know what's inside, \Nwe can't break the box."
10614,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It's not making a sound.
10615,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Your dad said to give this to you once you \Nbecame a Hunter, right?"
10616,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yeah, that's what I heard."
10617,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Once you became a Hunter...
10618,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I get it...
10619,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I figured it out!
10620,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Gon, there's one thing we haven't tried yet!"
10621,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Huh?
10622,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Something you have as a Hunter \Nthat you didn't have before.
10623,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, I know!"
10624,Ging x And x Gon!,37,My Hunter License!
10625,Ging x And x Gon!,37,But there isn't an opening for the card...
10626,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"No, that isn't it."
10627,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Nen{\i0
10628,Ging x And x Gon!,37,There's another box inside.
10629,Ging x And x Gon!,37,These are just steel plates.
10630,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It appears nothing was connecting them.
10631,Ging x And x Gon!,37,What's wrong?
10632,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Doesn't that design look familiar?
10633,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This is...
10634,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I know!
10635,Ging x And x Gon!,37,This is like the pattern on the promise \Nthread Wing-san gave me.
10636,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Wasn't that designed
10637,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Nen{\i0
10638,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Nen{\i0
10639,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Maybe we're supposed to put the card in here now.
10640,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It worked!
10641,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Bingo!
10642,Ging x And x Gon!,37,A ring and a cassette tape...
10643,Ging x And x Gon!,37,And a memory card?
10644,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Look.
10645,Ging x And x Gon!,37,That pattern is on the back of this ring.
10646,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You should take care before you put it on.
10647,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Really?
10648,Ging x And x Gon!,37,You think that Ging might try to hurt me?
10649,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Just to be safe.
10650,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Well, we can start by listening to the tape."
10651,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I guess.
10652,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Oh, can you copy it?"
10653,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Sure, why?"
10654,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Just to be safe.
10655,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Yo, Gon..."
10656,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"So you became a Hunter, too."
10657,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Anyway, I have a question for you."
10658,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Do you want to see me?
10659,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It was the first time Gon had \Nheard his father's voice.
10660,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging appeared to have read Gon's mind when he recorded his question.
10661,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
10662,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
10663,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
10664,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Hunterpedia!
10665,Ging x And x Gon!,37,It's Gon and Killua's
10666,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Hunterpedia!
10667,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
10668,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Today, we introduce Mito-san!"
10669,Ging x And x Gon!,37,She raised me.
10670,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Raised Gon and has been \Nwaiting on Whale Island
10671,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"To me, Mito-san will always be my mom. for Gon to return."
10672,Ging x And x Gon!,37,I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...
10673,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Ging's cousin and \Nchildhood friend.
10674,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"She's the best, though she nags a lot!"
10675,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Next Time: Reply x From x Dad!
10676,Ging x And x Gon!,37,"Earthquake, thunderstorm, fire, or Dad."
10677,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Which one scares you most?
10678,Ging x And x Gon!,37,Mito-san.
10679,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
10680,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
10681,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
10682,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"The word ""unknown"" holds magic."
10683,Reply x From x Dad!,38,And some incredible people are \Ndrawn to that magic.
10684,Reply x From x Dad!,38,They are known...
10685,Reply x From x Dad!,38,...as Hunters!
10686,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What's this?
10687,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Something Ging left with me.
10688,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Huh?
10689,Reply x From x Dad!,38,He asked me to give this to you \Nwhen you became a Hunter.
10690,Reply x From x Dad!,38,My dad left this for me...
10691,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Reply x From x Dad
10692,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Nen{\i0 contained three mysterious items.
10693,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"One of them, an old cassette tape, gave Gon his first chance to hear his father's voice."
10694,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Yo, Gon..."
10695,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"So you became a Hunter, too."
10696,Reply x From x Dad!,38,This is my dad's voice.
10697,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Anyway, I have a question for you."
10698,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Do you want to see me?
10699,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If you do, keep on listening."
10700,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If you don't, press the stop button."
10701,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"I'm guessing that's a ""yes."""
10702,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Then I'll ask you once more.
10703,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Are you prepared?
10704,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Hunters are selfish creatures.
10705,Reply x From x Dad!,38,They're willing to sacrifice \Nanything to get what they want.
10706,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If you're only slightly interested in seeing me, you should stop the tape now."
10707,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'll give you a minute to consider it.
10708,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Well?
10709,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I guess you really do want to see me.
10710,Reply x From x Dad!,38,But I don't want to see you.
10711,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I don't know how I could face you now.
10712,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"After all, I chose my own desires over my parental duty."
10713,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'm a bad person.
10714,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"I'm guessing that by the time \Nyou hear this tape, at least ten years will have passed."
10715,Reply x From x Dad!,38,But one thing still hasn't changed.
10716,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'm still me.
10717,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Bo!
10718,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"As you listen to this tape,"
10719,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'm off doing reckless things.
10720,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If you want to see me, find me."
10721,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"But as I said before, I don't want to see you."
10722,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If I sense you nearby, \NI'll make myself scarce."
10723,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Catch me if you can.
10724,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"You are a Hunter, aren't you?"
10725,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Your dad isn't gonna be easy to track.
10726,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Oh, wait..."
10727,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Ging's still there.
10728,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Oh, I forgot to mention something..."
10729,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It's about your mother.
10730,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If you want to know more, keep listening."
10731,Reply x From x Dad!,38,If you're not interested...
10732,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Are you sure?
10733,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Yeah.
10734,Reply x From x Dad!,38,But he might have left you a clue.
10735,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I doubt it.
10736,Reply x From x Dad!,38,That's what my gut tells me.
10737,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Besides, I already told you..."
10738,Reply x From x Dad!,38,My mom is Mito-san.
10739,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I see.
10740,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Are you hungry?
10741,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'll go grab something.
10742,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Yeah.
10743,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Hey, Gon!"
10744,Reply x From x Dad!,38,The tape started moving all by itself!
10745,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What?!
10746,Reply x From x Dad!,38,There's aura around the tape player!
10747,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Nen{\i0
10748,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Nen{\i0
10749,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Is he nearby?
10750,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Nen{\i0
10751,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"So it would start rewinding, \Nonce it was stopped!"
10752,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Why?
10753,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Beats me.
10754,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Now it's recording!
10755,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I get it! He's erasing his message!
10756,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What?
10757,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It's not working!
10758,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I can't stop it...
10759,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Damn!
10760,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It still won't stop!
10761,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I pulled the plug!
10762,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Sorry, Gon."
10763,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'll have to break it!
10764,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Damn!
10765,Reply x From x Dad!,38,No good!
10766,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Nen{\i0
10767,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It's finished.
10768,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Now it's recording!
10769,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I get it! He's erasing his message!
10770,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What?
10771,Reply x From x Dad!,38,The other tape was also wiped.
10772,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Why would he go to all this trouble?
10773,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I'm guessing he didn't want to leave any clues.
10774,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Clues?
10775,Reply x From x Dad!,38,You can extract a lot of information \Nfrom an audio clip.
10776,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Really?
10777,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"You can determine the \Nspeaker's height, weight, gender, age, facial features, chronic diseases, and state of mind."
10778,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"From the background noise, \Nyou can also determine the location."
10779,Reply x From x Dad!,38,But he was more worried \Nabout something else.

10789,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Yeah, it's smaller than a normal memory card."
10790,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Maybe you need a special machine to use it?
10791,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Huh? You can't tell?
10792,Reply x From x Dad!,38,This memory card only works with the JS.
10793,Reply x From x Dad!,38,The JS?

10812,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"You've never played any video games, have you?"
10813,Reply x From x Dad!,38,That's unusual.
10814,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Really?
10815,Reply x From x Dad!,38,That isn't a game disc.
10816,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It holds a game's memory data.
10817,Reply x From x Dad!,38,So you can't use it to play.
10818,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Yeah, you're supposed to \Nput the disc in here."
10819,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"But if you insert the memory card and \Npower it on without a game inside, you can see which games are using that memory."
10820,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Oh, really..."
10821,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It looks like there's only one game saved on it.

10833,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What?
10834,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Not a single match?
10835,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Does that mean it's out of print?
10836,Reply x From x Dad!,38,There aren't any used copies...
10837,Reply x From x Dad!,38,An out-of-print game would still have \Nsome used copies floating around.
10838,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It's possible that this game isn't for sale.
10839,Reply x From x Dad!,38,What do you mean?
10840,Reply x From x Dad!,38,It could be an indie game that was never for sale or was \Nbanned for some reason.
10841,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Anyway, I'll keep searching."
10842,Reply x From x Dad!,38,There we go.

10859,Reply x From x Dad!,38,That explains how they sold out.
10860,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Do the makers have any left in stock?

10866,Reply x From x Dad!,38,I guess we'll have to find someone with \Na copy and ask them to let us have it.
10867,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Yeah, our best bet is to advertise \Non a reverse auction website and wait for someone to offer to sell us a copy."

10869,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"If we pool our money from the arena, that's eight hundred million."

10871,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Not necessarily.
10872,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Huh?
10873,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"With these private deals, \Nthe seller holds all the power."
10874,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Typically, they'll ask for more \Nthan the original price."

10967,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"In return, I got two pieces \Nof solid information."

10982,Reply x From x Dad!,38,Isn't Yorknew City...
10983,Reply x From x Dad!,38,"Yes, the place where we're supposed \Nto meet Kurapika and Leorio."

11085,Wish x And x Promise!,39,There's something forming in the water...
11086,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You're a Conjurer.
11087,Wish x And x Promise!,39,A Conjurer...
11088,Wish x And x Promise!,39,A type that specializes in \Nmanifesting their auras.
11089,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I see...
11090,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Ideally, I would have liked to \Nhave been an Enhancer."
11091,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Can't do anything about \Nwhat you're born with.
11092,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You can still learn Enhancer techniques.
11093,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'll spend the day expounding in further detail.
11094,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Let's say you have a 100% chance \Nof mastering Conjurer techniques.
11095,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"From that, these are your odds of learning \Nthe other techniques."
11096,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Enhancer 60% \NTransmuter 80% \NConjurer 100%
11097,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Emitter 40% \NManipulator 60% \NSpecialist 0% \N
11098,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hatsu
11099,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"It doesn't matter if you're a quick study, you can never completely \Nmaster a different category."
11100,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"The further a category is, the less likely \Nyou are to learn its techniques."
11101,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Why is Specialist 0%?
11102,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Specialist is a unique category.
11103,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You can't learn Specialist techniques.
11104,Wish x And x Promise!,39,These are very distinct abilities that are genetic or naturally acquired by \Ngrowing up under extreme conditions.
11105,Wish x And x Promise!,39,So why is it in this specific position?
11106,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Because the adjacent categories, \NConjurer and Manipulator, have the highest chance of \Nbecoming Specialists later on."
11107,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"In that respect, your chances \Nare better than most."
11108,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Remember what you said earlier?
11109,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I...
11110,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I need... enough power to fight on my own!
11111,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You are correct to assume that the fastest means to your \Ngoal would be via Enhancer abilities.
11112,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"The Enhancer category \Nis the most efficacious for bolstering offensive, \Ndefensive, and healing capabilities."
11113,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"However, as a Conjurer, you can only learn Enhancer techniques \Nat about half of their original potency."
11114,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"When you attempt to use an ability beyond \Nyour capacity, this creates strain, which can weaken you, possibly fatally."
11115,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"In order to consistently come out \Non top, you need a stable power."
11116,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Will the stable power gained through \Nmastery of Conjurer techniques put me on equal footing \Nwith master Enhancers?
11117,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The brief answer is that it would be difficult.
11118,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Enhancers employ strong offensive \Nand defensive abilities.
11119,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Conjurers usually suffer from an \Ninclination toward one or the other.
11120,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"On the other hand, this makes them incredibly \Nstrong under the correct circumstances."
11121,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Pop quiz time.
11122,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Is it possible to conjure a sword \Nthat can cut through anything?
11123,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That is impossible.
11124,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Why?
11125,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Because that exceeds the \Nbounds of human ability.
11126,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Exactly.
11127,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Even if you completely master \NConjurer techniques, you will still be unable to \Nconjure some objects."
11128,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"You could conjure a sharp, sturdy sword."
11129,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"However, it would make more \Nsense to just buy a good sword."
11130,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Because it wouldn't require \Nany additional training.
11131,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Nen{\i0
11132,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"So conjured weapons aren't as effective \Nas their physical counterparts, but you can't conjure anything omnipotent."
11133,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You will need to reflect on what \Nit is that you wish to conjure.
11134,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Failure is not acceptable.
11135,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Because you will need an incredible amount of focus, imagination, and training to conjure a single object."
11136,Wish x And x Promise!,39,This is a surprise.
11137,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Nen{\i0
11138,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"So, what kind of employer are you seeking?"
11139,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I have some information for you \Nregarding the spider.
11140,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I shall await you in Yorknew City, \Non September 1st."
11141,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'm looking for someone who has a lot of \Ninfluence on the Yorknew auction.
11142,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The nature of the job itself is irrelevant.
11143,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The Yorknew City auction...
11144,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Employers with a lot of influence generally post the more difficult jobs.
11145,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I doubt any of them will hire a \NHunter with zero experience.
11146,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I see three of them...
11147,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Three employers who will decide based on \Nthe interview, rather than your record."
11148,Wish x And x Promise!,39,And they're only looking for bodyguards.
11149,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I'll give you descriptions, \Nso make your choice."
11150,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The first one is a gun fanatic.
11151,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Specifically, he's looking for a Midget Corp.\NGolsnake 55, Limited Edition, Series #001."
11152,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The second one is a collector of fine china.
11153,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Wants Lord Corp. commemorative \Nplates from 1655 and 1657...
11154,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The third one collects human trophies.
11155,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Skin covered in snaking dragon tattoos, jellied infant skulls, etc."
11156,Wish x And x Promise!,39,A fascinating hobby.
11157,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Well, take your pick."
11158,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Chains?
11159,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Yes, when I heard about conjuring, that was the first thing that came to mind."
11160,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Chains, huh..."
11161,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Why's that?
11162,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Because there's evil running \Nloose that needs to be chained down to hell.
11163,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Really, now?"
11164,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I have a feeling that you're \Nreally chaining yourself down.
11165,Wish x And x Promise!,39,What do you know?
11166,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hey! Wait up!
11167,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'm your teacher!
11168,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'm not finished talking!
11169,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hold it right there!
11170,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Didn't you hear my explanation?
11171,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!
11172,Wish x And x Promise!,39,And conjuring unbreakable chains is impossible!
11173,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"On September 1st,"
11174,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Yorknew City will host the \Nworld's greatest auction.
11175,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That's where the spider...
11176,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Where the Phantom Troupe will appear.
11177,Wish x And x Promise!,39,What a fearsome heartbeat...
11178,Wish x And x Promise!,39,It plays a terrible melody of rage...
11179,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You want me to introduce \Nyou to an employer with connections to the Yorknew auction?
11180,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Yes.
11181,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Just like the last person who walked in.
11182,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Huh?
11183,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I got the same request twice today.
11184,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That's amusing.
11185,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The boy I just passed?
11186,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You know him?
11187,Wish x And x Promise!,39,What?
11188,Wish x And x Promise!,39,No.
11189,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"He is interested in the auction, too..."
11190,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Why is his heartbeat so full of rage?
11191,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That twerp will only make \Nyour dinner taste worse.
11192,Wish x And x Promise!,39,We're more than willing to \Ntake you on a date.
11193,Wish x And x Promise!,39,We'll give you the best night of your life.
11194,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Unfortunately, I am not on a date."
11195,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'm in the middle of a job.
11196,Wish x And x Promise!,39,A job?
11197,Wish x And x Promise!,39,This is my employer.
11198,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I am his bodyguard.
11199,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Bodyguard?
11200,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That's a riot.
11201,Wish x And x Promise!,39,This babe is a bodyguard?
11202,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'd like you to guard my body.
11203,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I don't guard ugly men.
11204,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Watch your mouth, woman!"
11205,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Just shut up and...
11206,Wish x And x Promise!,39,180-Minute Love Slave
11207,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Instant Lover.
11208,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Every person I kiss becomes my slave.
11209,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Please command me, mistress!"
11210,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Beat them up for me.
11211,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Yes, I would love to!"
11212,Wish x And x Promise!,39,What?
11213,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Tsk, he got away."
11214,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Man, I'll have to find a new employer."
11215,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Such a splendid moon...
11216,Wish x And x Promise!,39,There he is!
11217,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Surrender!
11218,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Return the corpse samples you stole!
11219,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Don't you interrupt my work \Nor this splendid moon.
11220,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Enough fooling around! \NHands in the air!
11221,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Tsk, I was on the verge of \Nanother masterful poem."
11222,Wish x And x Promise!,39,But you've ruined the moment.
11223,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"""A splendid full moon \Nand pursuers as clumsy \Nas baboons could be."""
11224,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Damn, that's horrible."
11225,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I know, Eliza."
11226,Wish x And x Promise!,39,If this job works out...
11227,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Yeah, don't worry."
11228,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I can take care of you along with all of the dogs.
11229,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"You don't need to worry, Eliza."
11230,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Just bear with me a little longer.
11231,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Yeah, it'll be fine."
11232,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You can count on me.
11233,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I was sent here by the agency.
11234,Wish x And x Promise!,39,My name is Kurapika.
11235,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Welcome.
11236,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Please wait in here.
11237,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I apologize for the wait.
11238,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Everyone has arrived, so we will now explain the contract."
11239,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'll start by stating the requirements.
11240,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I won't ask whether you have a License.
11241,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'm only interested in whether you can obtain the items we request.
11242,Wish x And x Promise!,39,There's one month before the auction begins.
11243,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Before then, you must find one item \Nfrom the list we will provide, and bring it here."
11244,Wish x And x Promise!,39,These are the data cards.
11245,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Lock of hair of the famous actress Sara.
11246,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Right arm of a mummy from an Egyptian tomb.
11247,Wish x And x Promise!,39,An ichthyosis patient's scaly skin.
11248,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Skull of a one-horned creature.
11249,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The eyeballs of a Kurta.
11250,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hmm?
11251,Wish x And x Promise!,39,What's wrong? You look pale.
11252,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Ah, Kurta eyeballs?"
11253,Wish x And x Promise!,39,A-rank obtainment difficulty.
11254,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"""Preserve the scarlet hue \Nimmediately following death."
11255,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Preferably with the head included."""
11256,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I've heard rumors that when Kurta get excited, their eyes turn scarlet..."
11257,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Shut up.
11258,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Not another word.
11259,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I'll say it again.
11260,Wish x And x Promise!,39,You need only find one item from the list.
11261,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"If you are successful, you will be hired, to begin training as a \Nbodyguard and a collector."
11262,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Best of luck, then."
11263,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I will pass this test.
11264,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"First I need to curry their favor, \Nand win their trust."
11265,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"The man talking was, most likely, \Nnot the actual employer."
11266,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That only illustrates the distance \Nbetween the boss and me...
11267,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I shall reduce that distance to zero, until the employer feels that he \Ncan trust me with his secrets..."
11268,Wish x And x Promise!,39,There are two things that \Ncollectors always want.
11269,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The first is any item of extreme rarity.
11270,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The second is colleagues to whom they \Ncan brag about their collection.
11271,Wish x And x Promise!,39,He must have connections to \Nother human parts collectors.
11272,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Collectors who share their \Ndisgusting acquisitions, a network of the lowest scum."
11273,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"I'll worm my way in, so that I can eradicate them all."
11274,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hmm? The door won't open.
11275,Wish x And x Promise!,39,I forgot to mention one thing.
11276,Wish x And x Promise!,39,The barest minimum requirement \Nis that you be strong...
11277,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.
11278,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Kurapika pursues his quest \Nto avenge his brethren and to punish the Phantom Troupe.
11279,Wish x And x Promise!,39,He prepares to step onto a new battlefield.
11280,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
11281,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
11282,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
11283,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Hunterpedia!
11284,Wish x And x Promise!,39,It's Gon and Killua's

11290,Wish x And x Promise!,39,He's classified as an Emitter.
11291,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Nen{\i0
11292,Wish x And x Promise!,39,It seems he wasn't able to \Nearn Kurapika's respect.
11293,Wish x And x Promise!,39,That's what happened in our case.
11294,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Fate had a hand in crossing our paths!
11295,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Nen{\i0
11296,Wish x And x Promise!,39,"Hey, Gon..."
11297,Wish x And x Promise!,39,Let's go break some of Milluki's figures.

11299,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11300,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Enhancer.
11301,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Enhancers are able to strengthen \Nvarious objects' effectiveness.
11302,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Transmuter.
11303,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Transmuters can use their aura \Nto alter objects' qualities.
11304,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Conjurer.
11305,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Somewhat akin to Transmuters, \NConjurers are able to manifest their aura."
11306,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Emitter.
11307,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Emitters can propel their \Naura like projectiles.
11308,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Manipulator.
11309,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Manipulators can use their auras to \Ncontrol objects and creatures.
11310,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Specialist.
11311,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Specialists are those with rare abilities \Nthat don't fit in the other five classes.
11312,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Begin by determining which \Ncategory your aura falls within.

11323,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Hmm? The door won't open.

11325,Wish x And x Promise!,40,The barest minimum requirement \Nis that you be strong...
11326,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Strong enough to leave this mansion alive.
11327,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Dowsing Chain \NThe Guiding Ring Finger Chain
11328,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That's impressive.
11329,Wish x And x Promise!,40,He used a chain to catch the bullets?
11330,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Three with guns.
11331,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Six with swords.
11332,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Two more with swords above.
11333,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"You guys did a good job \Nof concealing your presences, but you're too weak."
11334,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11335,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Now I understand.
11336,Wish x And x Promise!,40,So that's what's going on.
11337,Wish x And x Promise!,40,He's the one.
11338,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Stop them.
11339,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'll give you three seconds.
11340,Wish x And x Promise!,40,One...
11341,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Two...
11342,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Okay.
11343,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I get it.
11344,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Wh-What's going on?

11346,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I could tell when I landed a punch, that I was hitting aura shaped like a human..."
11347,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"However,"
11348,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11349,Wish x And x Promise!,40,How did you know?
11350,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You were always careful to stand \Nnext to others for camouflage.
11351,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"But when I observed from above, \Neverything was clear."
11352,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You were the only person not under attack.
11353,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I realized something was wrong when assailants appeared on the second floor.
11354,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"After I jumped on the chandelier, they just stood there, swords swinging in a futile attempt to reach me."
11355,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I assume they received the following order:
11356,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Attack the nearest enemy.
11357,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"The assailants were given \Nsimple instructions, so their attacks were also simple."
11358,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0 to control eleven human-sized \Nauras simultaneously.
11359,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11360,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Given the size of auras involved, the Manipulator had to be \Nwithin a few meters."
11361,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0 was inside this room.
11362,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You nailed it.
11363,Wish x And x Promise!,40,My name is Shachmono Tocino.
11364,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'm actually a Hunter.
11365,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I work for the boss here, so I will have seniority over you."
11366,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Now that everything's clear, \Ncould you drop the knife?"
11367,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Judging by those chains, \Nyou must be a Manipulator..."
11368,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Well, I hope you won't hold a grudge."
11369,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I was just following orders from the boss.
11370,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"""Test them by trying to kill them."""
11371,Wish x And x Promise!,40,But I never expected you to \Npick up on me so fast.
11372,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Well, the four of you together should be able to escape this mansion."
11373,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Good luck.
11374,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Four?
11375,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Is there another plant in the room?
11376,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'll assume that was meant as a diversion.
11377,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"But either way, it was a mistake."
11378,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I shall determine if there \Nare any other plants, before we all start becoming paranoid."
11379,Wish x And x Promise!,40,There.
11380,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You are a plant.
11381,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Th-That's ridiculous!
11382,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What makes you say that?
11383,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Your chain just started swinging.
11384,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That is dowsing.
11385,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Huh? What's that?
11386,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Dowsing was originally a technique for locating water \Nor metals underground.
11387,Wish x And x Promise!,40,But it was also used in divination.
11388,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I've heard of the technique being \Nemployed as a lie detector.
11389,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That still doesn't provide concrete proof that I'm a plant.
11390,Wish x And x Promise!,40,He's probably right.
11391,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Your heart began to pound as \Nsoon as he pointed at you.
11392,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If you were innocent, your heart rate would have slowly increased, due to the stress of being wrongly accused."
11393,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"But your heartbeat immediately sped up, before gradually slowing down."
11394,Wish x And x Promise!,40,The typical melody of a liar...
11395,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Coming from both of you.
11396,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'm convinced.
11397,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Both of them accuse you.
11398,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That's two of the remaining five.
11399,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Wait! Hold on!
11400,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That doesn't make it true.
11401,Wish x And x Promise!,40,It's possible that three out of five are \Napplicants and two are fakes.
11402,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I can confirm that he is not a plant.
11403,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Excuse me?
11404,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I think you meant ""she,"" not ""he."""
11405,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"And it appears that you \Nare not a plant, either."
11406,Wish x And x Promise!,40,My point is that we can't trust you!
11407,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You two could be working together.
11408,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"A-Anyway, this is a waste of time."
11409,Wish x And x Promise!,40,We won't get anywhere by standing around.
11410,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"No other choice, then.\NI will have to settle this\Nmatter on my own."
11411,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"""Everything that comes \Ninto contact with my fist \Nwill completely burn."""
11412,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Huh?
11413,Wish x And x Promise!,40,This is my special power...
11414,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Great Haikuist!
11415,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Great Haikuist\NWandering Haiku Poet
11416,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Damn it all to hell.\NIt didn't burn very well.\NThat was a failure.
11417,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"That was a haiku, the prized literary art of my homeland."
11418,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"When I read a haiku, it happens."
11419,Wish x And x Promise!,40,There's your explanation.
11420,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Back to the subject at hand.
11421,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"""Any person who \Nresponds untruthfully to \Nmy question will burn."""
11422,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"In other words, liars will burn in hell."
11423,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Here is my question.
11424,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Are you a plant?
11425,Wish x And x Promise!,40,No.
11426,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What about you?
11427,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I am not.
11428,Wish x And x Promise!,40,And you?
11429,Wish x And x Promise!,40,No.
11430,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Are you a plant?
11431,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yeah, that's right."
11432,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Think carefully before you answer.
11433,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Are you a plant?
11434,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Give me your answer!
11435,Wish x And x Promise!,40,My answer is yes.
11436,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Impressive.
11437,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'll reward you with some information.
11438,Wish x And x Promise!,40,My name is Squala.
11439,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I don't have an official license, but I'm a Hunter with Manipulator skills."
11440,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I've used my Manipulator abilities to instruct something to \Nfollow a certain order.
11441,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"You managed to unmask me, but that doesn't mean you'll \Nbe able to escape alive..."
11442,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"What was the something, \Nand what was the order?"
11443,Wish x And x Promise!,40,This wouldn't be much of \Na test if I just told you.
11444,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Fool.
11445,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Even if you torture me, I won't talk."
11446,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Huh?
11447,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"This is my power, Instant Lover."
11448,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I am also a Manipulator.
11449,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Anyone I kiss becomes my slave.
11450,Wish x And x Promise!,40,M-M-Mistress...
11451,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Take that, and that, and that. \NAnd that... And that!"
11452,Wish x And x Promise!,40,More!
11453,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Please step on me more...
11454,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Now, answer my question!"
11455,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11456,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Talk, quickly."
11457,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If you don't answer, I'll stop treading on you!"
11458,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'll talk! I'll talk!
11459,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I am just a l-lowly dog trainer...
11460,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That is...
11461,Wish x And x Promise!,40,A fearsome power.
11462,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0 that run around this mansion.
11463,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"For example, the Maltese were told to nip at a target's feet, to slow them."
11464,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That's when the St. Bernard is to use \Nits large body to smother the target.
11465,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"At the same time, the Dobermans will rush in and finish off the target..."
11466,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If the target still escapes, \Nthe bulldogs will—"
11467,Wish x And x Promise!,40,That's enough...
11468,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nen{\i0
11469,Wish x And x Promise!,40,A-At once!
11470,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"So the dog tamer has been \Nreduced to a pet, huh?"
11471,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Don't say that...
11472,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I only did it to make him talk.
11473,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If I wanted a man as a pet, \NI'd be more picky."
11474,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"That reminds me,"
11475,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I never did catch your name.
11476,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'm Basho.
11477,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"As you've already seen, I'm a Conjurer."
11478,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I am Baise.
11479,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Melody.
11480,Wish x And x Promise!,40,It appears you can hear heartbeats.
11481,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What category do you fall into?
11482,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Well, I'm sure you'll find out soon enough."
11483,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Playing coy, huh?"
11484,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What about you?
11485,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I'd like to know your name.
11486,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Would you tell us?
11487,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I refuse.
11488,Wish x And x Promise!,40,We do not know if we'll \Nbe working together.
11489,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yeah, that's true."
11490,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"We cleared the first test, \Nescaping the mansion, but the real test has just begun."
11491,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"We must locate one of the designated items, or we can't get the job."
11492,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If we're all interested in this job, we're bound to run into one other again."
11493,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What is your opinion of this group?
11494,Wish x And x Promise!,40,This particular group looks promising.
11495,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"More promising than him, at least."
11496,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I will not require him for a while.
11497,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Put him away for now.
11498,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I trust you can handle that, Squala."
11499,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Y-Yes...
11500,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If I find one of the objects \Nand earn the contract,"
11501,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I will have passage to the \NYorknew City auction.
11502,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yes, I absolutely must attend!"
11503,Wish x And x Promise!,40,The Phantom Troupe will be there...
11504,Wish x And x Promise!,40,The band of thieves that slaughtered my fellow Kurta.
11505,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Our eyes burn a deep scarlet.
11506,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Those thieves were willing to \Nmurder to obtain those eyes, considered one of the world's \Ntop seven beautiful things."
11507,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I will never forgive that act.
11508,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I shall track them down and utterly annihilate them!
11509,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Greed Island{\i0
11510,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Looks like the memory card that \NKil found is the real deal.
11511,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"You can probably decipher the data \Nand recreate the game, right?"
11512,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You bet I can.
11513,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I'll strip down the code, \Nand clear the entire game."
11514,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"I'll put an end to the legend, winning fifty billion Jenny in the process."
11515,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Oh, right."
11516,Wish x And x Promise!,40,This was a trade...
11517,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I have to tell Kil the URL for \Nthe Hunter-only website.
11518,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"If I break my end of the bargain, he might start talking about breaking \Nmy precious figures again."
11519,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"There it is, Killua."
11520,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yeah, we're almost to Yorknew."
11521,Wish x And x Promise!,40,We'll see Kurapika and Leorio there.
11522,Wish x And x Promise!,40,I can't wait!
11523,Wish x And x Promise!,40,You're jumping the gun...
11524,Wish x And x Promise!,40,We still have two weeks before \Nwe're supposed to meet.
11525,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Oh, you're right."
11526,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"It's been six months since we \Nsaw them, so I'm getting excited!"
11527,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Six months ago, I'd never have dreamed that we would come to Yorknew \Nfor a reason like this."
11528,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Until we meet again.
11529,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yeah, that'll be..."
11530,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"September 1st, in Yorknew City."
11531,Wish x And x Promise!,40,The auction begins on September 1st.
11532,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Greed Island{\i0
11533,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Yep, there might be information about Ging."
11534,Wish x And x Promise!,40,He left a memory card with his message.
11535,Wish x And x Promise!,40,There must be a connection.
11536,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Anyway, once I get the URL for the Hunter website from my brother, \Nwe can check it out."
11537,Wish x And x Promise!,40,This is it.
11538,Wish x And x Promise!,40,My brother sent the URL.
11539,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Great!
11540,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Let's get started.
11541,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Yeah!
11542,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Driven by their various goals,"
11543,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Gon and Killua prepare for September 1st.
11544,Wish x And x Promise!,40,What will they discover when the \NYorknew City auction begins?
11545,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
11546,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
11547,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
11548,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Hunterpedia!
11549,Wish x And x Promise!,40,It's Gon and Killua's
11550,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Hunterpedia!
11551,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
11552,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Today, we introduce Melody!"
11553,Wish x And x Promise!,40,She's a Music Hunter!
11554,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Has acute hearing.
11555,Wish x And x Promise!,40,She can read your state of mind by your heartbeat.
11556,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Able to determine a state of mind \Nby listening to the heartbeat.
11557,Wish x And x Promise!,40,She must have incredible senses.
11558,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Hey, Killua. Did you eat my chocolate?"
11559,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Female.
11560,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Nah.
11561,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Your face says you're lying.
11562,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Next time: Gathering x Of x Heroes!
11563,Wish x And x Promise!,40,"Killua, I can tell fortunes."
11564,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Really?
11565,Wish x And x Promise!,40,Hunter x Hunter{\i0
11566,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,This is it.
11567,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,My brother sent the URL.
11568,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Great!
11569,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Let's get started.
11570,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yeah!
11571,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Gathering x Of x Heroes
11572,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"As Kurapika obtains his ticket to face the Phantom Troupe \Nand avenge the Kurta,"
11573,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Gon and Killua also prepare for the auction in Yorknew City.
11574,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,This is the website for Hunters?
11575,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Yeah, I've heard that Hunters \Nworldwide post information here."
11576,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Worldwide?
11577,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Wow...
11578,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Please swipe your Hunter License, and enter your license code."
11579,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Put the cursor on the bartender.
11580,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What kind of information would you like?
11581,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Wow! There's so much!
11582,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Select the game category.
11583,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,There it is.
11584,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Greed Island{\i0
11585,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It will cost twenty million Jenny.
11586,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Twenty million...
11587,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,So they won't give out the \Ninformation for free.
11588,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Well, we don't really have a choice."
11589,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Deposit twenty million...
11590,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I can feel aura coming from the monitor!
11591,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11592,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Okay, now listen carefully."
11593,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Greed Island{\i0
11594,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11595,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Apparently, there were multiple creators, but no one knows their objective."
11596,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11597,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0 pulling the player inside the game.
11598,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Inside the game?
11599,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11600,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"And as long as the player stays \Nalive within the game, it will continue to run, even if the console is unplugged."
11601,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It will stop if the player dies.
11602,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"One person who owned the game hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot, but none of them ever came back."
11603,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I hear that you can return \Nif you find a save point.
11604,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Is that true?
11605,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,This information is from \Nthe Hunter website.
11606,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It's gotta be accurate.
11607,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"At the Yorknew City auction,"
11608,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Greed Island{\i0
11609,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The lowest starting bid is 8.9 billion Jenny.
11610,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,8.9 billion?!
11611,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The price has shot up!
11612,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's 3 billion more than the retail price!
11613,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Difficulty of obtainment is G-rank.
11614,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Huh?
11615,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The game is considered a legend, but there are plenty of copies."
11616,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If you have enough money, \Nit's relatively easy to procure."
11617,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hmm, a G..."
11618,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Lower than I expected.
11619,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The message is that if I can't \Neven get a simple game,"
11620,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"I'll never be able to find you,"
11621,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Ging.
11622,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Still, the money is a big problem."
11623,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hey, can we participate in the auction?"
11624,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,They're starting at 8.9 billion!
11625,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's out of our league.
11626,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"No, I mean by selling stuff."
11627,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Selling?
11628,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's it!
11629,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"We can look for treasure, \Nand then auction it off."
11630,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Okay!
11631,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"We can start with the 800 million we earned at Heavens Arena, and go from there."
11632,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yep!
11633,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"First, we'll start with online flea \Nmarkets and auction websites."
11634,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,And see what we can dig up.
11635,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Greed Island{\i0
11636,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yeah!
11637,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yay!
11638,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,How much do we have left?
11639,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Combined, we're at 10.84 million."
11640,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Damn...
11641,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Initially, we were making a profit."
11642,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's why I said we should only \Nuse trustworthy public sites.
11643,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I couldn't help it!
11644,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Only the risky sites are profitable.
11645,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It isn't working...
11646,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Now, show me what you've brought."
11647,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The hair of the famous actress Sara, and a DNA test to validate authenticity."
11648,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The right arm of an Egyptian mummy, \Ntaken directly from a pyramid."
11649,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The scaly skin of an ichthyosis patient.
11650,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The skull of a one-horned creature.
11651,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Okay, all four of you are hired."
11652,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"I'm Dalzollene, the head bodyguard."
11653,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It's a pleasure.
11654,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I'll need you to start working immediately.
11655,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Your mission is to escort the boss \Nto a Yorknew City hotel room.
11656,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"A private aircraft will take you to \NLingon Airport, just outside Yorknew."
11657,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The trip between airport and hotel takes approximately ninety minutes.
11658,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,A special car has been prepared.
11659,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You four will provide the \Nouter ring of security.
11660,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Any questions?
11661,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Do you know who might \Nbe targeting the boss?
11662,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That question isn't worth an answer.
11663,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What do you mean?
11664,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The boss is an important \Nfigure in the underworld.
11665,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,There are plenty of people with \Nreasons to hold a grudge.
11666,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Let me rephrase since you \Ndidn't understand the first time.
11667,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Regardless of grudges, do you know anyone who might actually\Ncommit to an attack?"
11668,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If we can identify a few candidates, we'll know \Ntheir motives, styles, and circumstances, and we can prepare accordingly."
11669,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That will facilitate protecting the boss.
11670,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You said that your name is Kurapika?
11671,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You are the one who doesn't understand.
11672,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Our job is to protect the boss, no matter who, when, \Nwhere, or how they attack."
11673,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's all you need to know!
11674,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Don't bother building a mental profile.
11675,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If anything comes too close, it's hostile."
11676,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I'll introduce you to the boss.
11677,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Come with me.
11678,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Excuse me.
11679,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What's that?
11680,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It's a little too realistic.
11681,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Yes, that is an actual human being."
11682,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,He was once a fellow bodyguard.
11683,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"He ignored my advice, and let himself be deceived \Nby false information, placing not only the other bodyguards, \Nbut the boss in danger as well."
11684,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,So he was punished.
11685,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You are replacing him.
11686,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Let's go.
11687,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Boss, I've brought the new bodyguards."
11688,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Please enter.
11689,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"This is the boss, Neon-sama."
11690,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Nice to meet you, everyone."
11691,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Anyway, I was pretty surprised when \Nwe were introduced to the boss."
11692,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No kidding...
11693,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"They called her an important \Nfigure in the underworld, so I was expecting someone intimidating, but she turned out to be a cute little girl."
11694,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Pakunoda, how's it going?"
11695,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Long time no see, Shalnark."
11696,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"You, too, Phinks."
11697,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You sure took your time getting here.
11698,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Oh?
11699,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I believe I'm right on schedule.
11700,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You're supposed to arrive \Nten minutes ahead of time.
11701,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Same to you guys.
11702,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Bonolenov!
11703,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Kortopi!
11704,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"You guys are going with us, too?"
11705,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yo!
11706,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Haven't seen your faces in a while.
11707,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"I'm here, chief."
11708,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What's our target this time?
11709,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Give us our orders!
11710,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Don't be in such a rush, Uvo."
11711,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Feitan's group won't arrive until evening.
11712,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,We'll wait until everyone's here.
11713,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You have no patience.
11714,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Damn, half a day of waiting."
11715,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Oh?
11716,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Is that Shizuku?
11717,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Hello.
11718,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Has the other new addition arrived yet?
11719,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No idea...
11720,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You should ask Machi.
11721,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,This is for September.
11722,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Huh? So many?
11723,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Yeah,"
11724,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Rotfelli-sama and Trinc-sama \Nwould like their fortunes told.
11725,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That just sucks.
11726,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I told you to stop increasing my workload.
11727,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I apologize.
11728,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Both of them are friendly with your father.
11729,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,And what's Daddy doing?
11730,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,He had to attend a meeting.
11731,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,He's probably off playing golf or hunting.
11732,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Daddy? This is Neon.
11733,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What? No!
11734,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You can't fool me!
11735,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No.
11736,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No!
11737,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Huh?
11738,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Fine, you have to keep your word."
11739,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If you break another promise, I'll quit."
11740,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Yay! I get another piece of treasure!
11741,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,A sweet deal.
11742,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Congratulations.
11743,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Okay...
11744,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Since that's settled, I'll get this over with."
11745,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Angelic Auto Writing\NLovely Ghostwriter
11746,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I hear she's an incredible diviner.
11747,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Thanks to her father's connections, she's made clients of some very \Nimportant people in the underworld."
11748,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"No, it's the other way around."
11749,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Other way around?
11750,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I'd say that the father has used \Nhis daughter to increase his standing in the underworld.
11751,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's why he is frightened of losing her.
11752,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Afraid that his enemies might strike back at his daughter.
11753,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Okay, all done."
11754,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Here.
11755,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Excellent work.
11756,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Say, tomorrow's auction starts at night, right?"
11757,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I want to do some shopping beforehand.
11758,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Very well, I shall accompany you."
11759,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"How many years has it been since all thirteen Troupe members gathered,"
11760,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Feitan?
11761,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Three years, two months."
11762,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"However, two members have since changed."
11763,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,#4 and #8 are now different people.
11764,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Machi, will #4,"
11765,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hisoka, actually show up today?"
11766,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No idea.
11767,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Don't ask me.
11768,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Wasn't he your responsibility?
11769,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I was only supposed to tell him to come.
11770,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I don't like Hisoka.
11771,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Why does the chief let \Nhim do as he pleases?
11772,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Because he has skills.
11773,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Skills, huh?"
11774,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,His Bungee Gum is quite impressive.
11775,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It would be difficult to counter.
11776,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What's your point?
11777,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Are you claiming that the \Nchief is afraid of Hisoka?
11778,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I won't let that statement stand.
11779,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That's not what I meant.
11780,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You're all being too generous. \NHe's nothing special.
11781,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Talk is cheap, as always."
11782,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Nobunaga, this is what happens when I \Nkeep quiet and let you yap."
11783,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"You were talking as much as I was, Franklin."
11784,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,And so it begins.
11785,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Ignore them.
11786,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,They're just playing around again.
11787,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Anyway, why is the chief \Ncalling everyone together?"
11788,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,We're thieves.
11789,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,There's something he wants us to steal.
11790,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Well, I know that much."
11791,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Yes, we've arrived at the hotel."
11792,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"However, one of the lady's \Nfortunes concerned me..."
11793,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"""An underground chamber \Nwhere everything costs extra."
11794,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That is where you will sleep.
11795,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Never descend stairs that \Nyou didn't first ascend.
11796,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Do not compete with others at numbers."""
11797,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,There were three other poems \Nthat begin with this verse.
11798,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Meaning that all four clients \Nreceived the same fortune.
11799,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The only thing connecting them is that they will be attending the \Nunderground auction this year.
11800,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"So the fortune is saying that \Ntheir lives are at risk, should they participate?"
11801,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"I'm assuming that ""sleep"" is a metaphor for succumbing to illness or death."
11802,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I understand.
11803,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I will pass the fortunes on to the clients.
11804,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,One more thing.
11805,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The lady never remembers \Nthe fortunes she's told, and she cannot tell her own fortune."
11806,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Does it make sense to let her \Nparticipate in the auction?
11807,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,No!
11808,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Bring her back immediately!
11809,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"However, I will need a proper \Nexplanation, or she'll never listen."
11810,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If she throws a tantrum, \Nwe won't be able to stop her."
11811,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"In any case, don't take her \Nto the auction site."
11812,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Send some bodyguards to place bids.
11813,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I understand.
11814,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Neon...
11815,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,He's not coming.
11816,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The sun's about to rise.
11817,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Damn Hisoka...
11818,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Next time I see him, I'll tear him apart."
11819,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Oh, dear..."
11820,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,That sounds quite gruesome.
11821,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,How very scary.
11822,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hisoka, you bastard!"
11823,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You're late.
11824,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Man, I thought you weren't going to come."
11825,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You asked me to come...
11826,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Had I broken my promise,"
11827,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I would never get to see \Nyour Nen Stitches again.
11828,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Chief, everyone's here."
11829,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Chief, what are we stealing this time?"
11830,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,We shall take the underground \Nauction's treasures.
11831,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Which ones?
11832,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Ancient texts? \NBecause the chief likes books.
11833,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"No, I'm thinking games."
11834,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,There will be multiple copies of the \Nmost expensive game ever for sale.
11835,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Wouldn't it be logical to take \Nprecious metals and gemstones?
11836,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Everything.
11837,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,We're taking everything \Nthat's up for auction.
11838,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Are you serious, chief?"
11839,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The underground auction is run by \Ngangs from across the world.
11840,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"If we do that, we'll be making \Nenemies of them all..."
11841,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Are you frightened, Uvogin?"
11842,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I'm thrilled!
11843,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I'm shaking with excitement...
11844,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Give us the command, chief!"
11845,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Right now!
11846,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You have my permission...
11847,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Kill them.
11848,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Kill every person who interferes.
11849,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Good work.
11850,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I have your next assignment.
11851,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,You must win the three items on this list \Nat the underground auction.
11852,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Money is no object.
11853,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The complete mummy of Princess Corco.
11854,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"A tissue used by the actor, Son Remarch."
11855,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Complete with DNA validation.
11856,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,And...
11857,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The eyeballs of a Kurta, also known as scarlet eyes."
11858,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Also, we've received information that \Nthere will be an attack on the auction."
11859,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Prepare for any unexpected complications, while focusing on the primary \Nobjective of obtaining these items."
11860,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,They're coming.
11861,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,They are definitely coming!
11862,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Kurapika awaits his chance \Nto avenge his brethren.
11863,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The Phantom Troupe, \Na band of murdering thieves."
11864,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"The sun has risen on the first day of the auction, where all sides will soon clash."
11865,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
11866,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
11867,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
11868,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Hunterpedia!
11869,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,It's Gon and Killua's
11870,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Hunterpedia!
11871,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
11872,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Today, we introduce Neon!"
11873,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,She's the Nostrade family head's daughter.
11874,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11875,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,She likes to collect human trophies.
11876,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Nen{\i0
11877,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,The most important member \Nof the Nostrade Family.
11878,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,I would try to tell my own fortune.
11879,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,But she can't do that.
11880,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Next time: Defend x And x Attack!
11881,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hey, Killua, are you better \Nat defending or attacking?"
11882,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,What do you think?
11883,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,"Hmm, attacking?"
11884,Gathering x Of x Heroes!,41,Bingo.
11885,Defend x And x Attack!,42,They're coming.
11886,Defend x And x Attack!,42,They are definitely coming!
11887,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Defend x And x Attack
11888,Defend x And x Attack!,42,September 1st.
11889,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"The day Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio had chosen to reunite in Yorknew City."
11890,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"On this morning, Gon and Killua were visiting the Yorknew market."
11891,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Wow, there are so many people!"
11892,Defend x And x Attack!,42,But this market's purpose is to swindle people who \Nhave come for the auction.
11893,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What?
11894,Defend x And x Attack!,42,This isn't the auction venue?
11895,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Obviously.
11896,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yorknew's dream auction is held once a year in the \Nworld's largest auction house.
11897,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"They say that, just during the \Nten days of official bidding, tens of trillions of Jenny exchange hands."
11898,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Tens of trillions?
11899,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Yeah, an item sold for ten thousand can be turned around for a \Nhundred million the next day."
11900,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You can make a fortune instantly.
11901,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's where dreams come true.
11902,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Wow...
11903,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Well, that's why a lot of underworld auctioning \Nhappens at the same time."
11904,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That's awesome...
11905,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Anyway, do you think Kurapika \Nand Leorio will show up?"
11906,Defend x And x Attack!,42,They promised to meet us here.
11907,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm sure they'll come.
11908,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yeah.
11909,Defend x And x Attack!,42,They might try to contact us.
11910,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Hey, you have to buy a phone!"
11911,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's standard Hunter gear.
11912,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Ah, that's true."
11913,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Hey! Welcome!
11914,Defend x And x Attack!,42,This one's great...
11915,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's the hottest current model!
11916,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Super-thin and no bigger than a credit card.
11917,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"It has GPS, which comes in \Nhandy for meeting with people."
11918,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Don't bother.
11919,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Hmm?
11920,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"That feature doesn't work in many countries, and it isn't even waterproof."
11921,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That model is for people \Nwho only make calls.
11922,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Leorio!
11923,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yo!
11924,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I would recommend... this Beetle 07.
11925,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"It's a little heavy and pricey, but it includes a translator for the \Ntwo hundred languages used worldwide."
11926,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What? Seriously?
11927,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Go with this one.
11928,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"I'll buy one, too!"
11929,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yeah!
11930,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Two, please."
11931,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Two will cost four hundred thousand.
11932,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Four hundred thousand?
11933,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"That's expensive, pops!"
11934,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Thanks, Leorio!"
11935,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"But, damn, 110,580 Jenny apiece, huh?"
11936,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"It's a new model, so that's a \Nfair price in this market."
11937,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Still, talk about overkill."
11938,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I've never seen a cell phone purchase greeted \Nwith applause before.
11939,Defend x And x Attack!,42,But you really saved us.
11940,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Just so you know, that was nothing."
11941,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The serious dealing only starts \Nwhen the seller tells you to leave.
11942,Defend x And x Attack!,42,He's the last person you \Nwould find at an auction.
11943,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No kidding.
11944,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So how are you guys doing?
11945,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What do you mean?
11946,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"You've trained and gotten stronger, right?"
11947,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What?!
11948,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You returned the tag to \NHisoka at Heavens Arena?
11949,Defend x And x Attack!,42,And you have to be pretty good \Nto make it to the 200s...
11950,Defend x And x Attack!,42,How strong have you gotten now?
11951,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Nen{\i0
11952,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Yeah, you bet."
11953,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Awesome!
11954,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Really?
11955,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Why would I lie to you?
11956,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"It's the ability to build up a shroud \Nof aura, one's own life force..."
11957,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Ten{\i0
11958,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Nen{\i0
11959,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Eh? There's more to it?
11960,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Figured as much.
11961,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Greed Island{\i0
11962,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A legendary game.
11963,Defend x And x Attack!,42,We're trying to get a copy at the auction.
11964,Defend x And x Attack!,42,But why a game?
11965,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I think this game holds a \Nclue to finding my dad.
11966,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Huh?
11967,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The game holds a clue to finding your dad?
11968,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What do you mean?
11969,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Well, it's a long story."
11970,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Anyway, the problem is the cost."
11971,Defend x And x Attack!,42,How much are we talking?
11972,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The lowest starting bid is
11973,Defend x And x Attack!,42,8.9 billion Jenny.
11974,Defend x And x Attack!,42,8.9 billion?!
11975,Defend x And x Attack!,42,How much do you have?
11976,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"We made some bad investments, so we're down to 5 million."
11977,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Listen up, kids..."
11978,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"This event is held at Southern Piece, \Nthe world's finest auction house."
11979,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The money you have won't \Ncover the entry fee.
11980,Defend x And x Attack!,42,But the game has a low difficulty rank\Non the Hunter site's treasure list.
11981,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Really?
11982,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Because you only need \Nmoney to get a copy.
11983,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It always comes back to money.
11984,Defend x And x Attack!,42,This world runs on money!
11985,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Well...
11986,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That just means that a real \Ntreasure can't be bought.
11987,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"If you can't obtain an item \Nlike this with ease, you can't be considered \Na pro Hunter, right?"
11988,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I don't need you to tell me that.
11989,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"But first, we need money..."
11990,Defend x And x Attack!,42,We'll need some starting funds.
11991,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Let's find a way to make \Nsome money in Yorknew!
11992,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yeah!
11993,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A simple fool.
11994,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Leorio's probably also an Enhancer.
11995,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Damn! What's wrong?!
11996,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I created a complete \Nduplicate of the program.
11997,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Why aren't any events being triggered?
11998,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Did Kil somehow trick me?
11999,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No... No way.
12000,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"He isn't capable of creating a fake game, and he's not stupid enough \Nto lie over a deal."
12001,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Was he tricked when he \Nobtained this card?
12002,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I want to know the answer.
12003,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll do whatever it takes to \Nuncover this secret...
12004,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No matter how much I have to pay.
12005,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I have 12.7 billion left.
12006,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll need at least twice that amount to guarantee a winning bid...
12007,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Dad, I want to make a deal."
12008,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"I'll kill fifteen people, \Nso lend me 15 billion."
12009,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Got it.
12010,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Bye.
12011,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Autopilot engaged to Lingon Airport.
12012,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I think I was ten...
12013,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The last time I went outside.
12014,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Huh? Swap?
12015,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What does that mean?
12016,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"""Swap."""
12017,Defend x And x Attack!,42,An auction technique.
12018,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Slang for the exchange of goods.
12019,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Also see ""Bind."""
12020,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What's a bind?
12021,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"""Bind."""
12022,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The seller names a condition \Nbesides money as their price.
12023,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The winning bid will be the \None that comes closest to meeting that condition.
12024,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Condition?
12025,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No idea what that means.
12026,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So that's it...
12027,Defend x And x Attack!,42,There's another kind of auctioning...
12028,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Tonight, at 9 PM, the mummy of Princess Corco \Nwill be auctioned off."
12029,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Ivlenkov,"
12030,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Tocino, and Baise, you'll handle the bidding."
12031,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Will three people be enough?
12032,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Each group of bidders \Nis limited to three people.
12033,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"You cannot bring weapons, \Nrecorders, or communication devices."
12034,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"All on-site security is handled by \Nthe Mafia that runs the auction, so there's rarely any trouble."
12035,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"All it takes is one wrong move to turn every Mafia member, \Nworldwide, against you."
12036,Defend x And x Attack!,42,This auction is built on trust.
12037,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Which is why the Mafia don't \Nuse security cameras.
12038,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The unspoken rule is that any grudges and the like are left outside.
12039,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Which means that if anything does happen, their testimony will decide everything."
12040,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Their words are treated as gospel.
12041,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So it's imperative to make \Na good impression.
12042,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Don't start any petty fights.
12043,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Avoid talking to anyone \Noutside this group.
12044,Defend x And x Attack!,42,What about the rest of us?
12045,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Basho and Linssen will cover the rear entrance.
12046,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Kurapika and Melody will \Ntake the front entrance.
12047,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Squala and I will guard the lady.
12048,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"And with that, the mission begins."
12049,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Come on down!
12050,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Let's have some \Nconditional auctioning fun!
12051,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Here's what's up for bid.
12052,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A diamond worth three million.
12053,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Comes with the appraisal of the \Nstore where I just bought it.
12054,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Arm wrestling will decide the winning bid.
12055,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The first person to beat this \Nboy wins the diamond.
12056,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee."
12057,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Now, let's start the auction!"
12058,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yeah! It's mine!
12059,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm in!
12060,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Count me in!
12061,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Okay, don't push..."
12062,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Form a line.
12063,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Adjust your strength to \Nmatch the opponent.
12064,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Every now and then, \Npretend to be struggling."
12065,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Okay, you're first!"
12066,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You need to pay the entry fee up front.
12067,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Here you go... 10,000 Jenny."
12068,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Thank you, step right up!"
12069,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Okay, clasp hands."
12070,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Just follow my instructions.
12071,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Are you ready?
12072,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You get a single round!
12073,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Ready...
12074,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Go!
12075,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Uh-oh!
12076,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Will he do it?
12077,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You almost have it...
12078,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Hang in there!
12079,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Oh, so close!"
12080,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Damn, I lost to a little kid..."
12081,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Next, please."
12082,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Ready... Go!
12083,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I get it.
12084,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So this is how conditional \Nauctioning works.
12085,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"But to reach 8.9 billion, we're going to need 889,999 wins."
12086,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Damn...
12087,Defend x And x Attack!,42,And you lose!
12088,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Next, please."
12089,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You lose!
12090,Defend x And x Attack!,42,He's beaten a hundred and fifty people!
12091,Defend x And x Attack!,42,He's gotta be running out of steam.
12092,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"He looks tired, \Nand he's sweating hard."
12093,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Don't lose before I get my turn!
12094,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I feel bad about tricking everyone.
12095,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm even breaking out in a cold sweat at the idea of making so \Nmuch money so easily.
12096,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Okay, next person, please."
12097,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Well, we have our first \Nfemale challenger!"
12098,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"All right! Get him, girl!"
12099,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Go easy on her, muscle boy!"
12100,Defend x And x Attack!,42,How old are you?
12101,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Where are you from?
12102,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Huh? You're no fun.
12103,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Let's have a fair contest.
12104,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Oh, yes."
12105,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Ready... Go!
12106,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Oh, too bad! You lose!"
12107,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Good job, girl!"
12108,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Thank you very much.
12109,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Oh, you're welcome."
12110,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A pity.
12111,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"That was your full strength, wasn't it?"
12112,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yeah...
12113,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I wonder who she is...
12114,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The world champion arm wrestler?
12115,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Well?
12116,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I lost.
12117,Defend x And x Attack!,42,He's strong.
12118,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That little boy?
12119,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I sort of wanted that diamond.
12120,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You should've used your left hand.
12121,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Yes, why didn't you use \Nyour stronger hand?"
12122,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Oh, right..."
12123,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"He extended his right hand, \Nso I did the same."
12124,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'd like to challenge him again.
12125,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You can't.
12126,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No time. We have our job.
12127,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yes.
12128,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Besides, buying and \Nbidding would be wrong."
12129,Defend x And x Attack!,42,We're thieves.
12130,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"If we want something, we take it."
12131,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No way! I'm going!
12132,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Can you hear me? \NI'm ready to give up...
12133,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Yes, her tantrum—"
12134,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"That is, her crying exhausted her, \Nand she's asleep now."
12135,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I don't know what will \Nhappen when she wakes.
12136,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"I vow to obtain the items she desires, but her goal is to participate \Nin the bidding personally."
12137,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So she'll be disappointed when she wakes up and realizes \Nthat she missed her chance.
12138,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Very well.
12139,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll adjust my schedule and \Nhead over personally.
12140,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"For now, just be sure to get \Nthat mummy princess, so we can get Neon in a good mood again."
12141,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Understood.
12142,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's me. How's it going?
12143,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Nothing unusual.
12144,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No changes visible from the outside.
12145,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Understood.
12146,Defend x And x Attack!,42,We'll notify you if anything happens.
12147,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Still, they're being quite thorough."
12148,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Only Mafia security are allowed within five hundred meters \Nof the auction house.
12149,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"If they didn't do that, the surroundings \Nwould be crawling with thugs."
12150,Defend x And x Attack!,42,They're practically announcing that \Nunwholesome practices are going on.
12151,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I suppose so.
12152,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Will the Phantom Troupe really show up?
12153,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Hmm?
12154,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That's the same sound I heard earlier.
12155,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"You see,"
12156,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I happened to see you \Nleaving the Hunter agency.
12157,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"When you walked past me, your heart was playing a melody of rage."
12158,Defend x And x Attack!,42,May I ask you a question?
12159,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yes.
12160,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Scarlet eyes.
12161,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Exactly what... do they mean to you?
12162,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Why do you ask?
12163,Defend x And x Attack!,42,No real reason.
12164,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Curiosity?
12165,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"When you saw the image \Non the data card, your heartbeat was even more fearsome."
12166,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It played a melody of boundless fury.
12167,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I suppose that I can't lie...
12168,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I am a Kurta.
12169,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Our eyes are normally brown, but they're red when we're excited."
12170,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So I wear black contacts \Nto avoid discovery.
12171,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I am searching for the eyes taken from my brethren.
12172,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll do whatever it takes to \Nreturn their eyes to them.
12173,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Will you report this to Dalzollene?
12174,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I will not.
12175,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I do not wish to be killed.
12176,Defend x And x Attack!,42,You could read my intention?
12177,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A heartbeat is always honest.
12178,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"When you began to confess \Nyour true nature to me, your heartbeat was calm, but frigid."
12179,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The heartbeat of one who is prepared to kill.
12180,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Your heart said that, though you would hold \Nno grudges, I was fair game if I talked."
12181,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Why did you take this job?
12182,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Why do you ask?
12183,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll probably lie.
12184,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'll know if you're lying by your eyes.
12185,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm also a pro Hunter...
12186,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"A Music Hunter, I suppose."
12187,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm looking for a certain musical score.
12188,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"You aren't lying, but you are concealing \Nsomething important."
12189,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"Well, let's just say that you're correct."
12190,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm looking for the Dark Sonata.
12191,Defend x And x Attack!,42,A solo said to have been \Ncomposed by the devil.
12192,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"There are four versions... \NFor the piano, violin, flute, and harp."
12193,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"If a human plays or listens to the piece, it's said that disaster will befall them."
12194,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Isn't that just a myth?
12195,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I doubt something like that \Ncould exist in reality.
12196,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I've heard the flute version.
12197,Defend x And x Attack!,42,One movement alone turned me into this.
12198,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"My friend who played the piece died, \Ntheir entire body like this."
12199,Defend x And x Attack!,42,That friend learned a single \Nmovement from someone who said never to play the music.
12200,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"That day, we were drunk and giddy."
12201,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"My body was destroyed, but I \Ngained this ability in return."
12202,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"However, I wish to restore my body."
12203,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I'm willing to do anything.
12204,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I don't want anyone else \Nto end up like me.
12205,Defend x And x Attack!,42,So I'll find the score and destroy it.
12206,Defend x And x Attack!,42,I chose this job because it will be more efficient to \Nwork from the underworld.
12207,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's time.
12208,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The underworld auction is about to start.
12209,Defend x And x Attack!,42,It's time.
12210,Defend x And x Attack!,42,Yes.
12211,Defend x And x Attack!,42,The Phantom Troupe prepares \Nto bare its fangs.
12212,Defend x And x Attack!,42,"How will Kurapika, now a \NNostrade Family bodyguard, deal with them?"

12240,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The Nostrade Family has \Nlearned that someone plans to attack the \Nunderground auction run by the Mafia community.
12241,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Kurapika and the other bodyguards have begun their assignments.
12242,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Everyone's here...
12243,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,These are mostly Mafia leaders.
12244,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We even have some head honchos here.
12245,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I'm surprised.
12246,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Why?
12247,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's only an auction...
12248,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,They could send an agent.
12249,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Their honor's on the line.
12250,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"For each winning bid, five percent goes back into the \NMafia community as a commission."
12251,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Does that act as a bribe?
12252,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Like, the more they bid, \Nthe more they'll receive?"
12253,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Yeah, that's how the Mafia flexes \Nits financial muscles."
12254,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,So this is a chance to improve \Ntheir standings.

12267,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That means he's also an Emitter!
12268,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"He'll break through my Nen barrier, and pierce my body..."
12269,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Each bullet packs an incredible punch!
12270,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Run!
12271,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Inform the boss—
12272,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Baise, you go ahead..."
12273,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That was way too fast...
12274,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I didn't get to do anything.
12275,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"All yours, Shizuku."
12276,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Let's go, Blinky."
12277,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Suck up the bodies, blood, body parts, and all their possessions."
12278,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Grab the chairs, too."
12279,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Nen{\i0
12280,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Oh?
12281,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Someone's still alive.
12282,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Wh-Who are you?
12283,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Doesn't matter.
12284,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You're all dead...
12285,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The community will destroy you.
12286,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Your family!
12287,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Torture you... Cut you up.
12288,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You'll taste hell!
12289,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Family?
12290,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,What's that?
12291,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"I'm having difficulty hearing clearly, but there's a real commotion \Ninside the building."
12292,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Something must have happened.
12293,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Contact the leader!
12294,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Got it.
12295,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I'll contact Linssen and Basho.
12296,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You two head inside!
12297,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Wha...
12298,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,What?
12299,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,There's no one here.
12300,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Where did they go? \NSearch the place!
12301,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Hey, what happened to \Nthe merchandise?"
12302,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Underground... Head underground, now!"
12303,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It appears that everyone in the \Nauction house has disappeared.
12304,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,What?
12305,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The whole place is in an uproar.
12306,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's out of control.
12307,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,What about the merchandise?
12308,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Melody is heading underground, to the safe."
12309,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I-It's empty...
12310,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The goods for today's auction \Nhave been stolen!
12311,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Who did this?!
12312,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Damn!
12313,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Where'd they go?
12314,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Split up and search, fool!"
12315,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Send word to every gang...
12316,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Quickly!
12317,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Okay, understood."
12318,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We'll catch those thieves.
12319,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I'll head over.
12320,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho \Nbehind the building, in Central Park."
12321,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Squala...
12322,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Yes?
12323,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Just in case, leave five dogs behind."
12324,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Right.
12325,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Listen up!
12326,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Don't take your eyes off the boss!
12327,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Don't let anyone in the \Nroom until we return.
12328,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Yes.
12329,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,All roads are sealed.
12330,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The only remaining escape \Nroute is by air!
12331,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"If you see any suspicious \Naircraft, contact me."
12332,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Make sure not to kill them.
12333,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The community has offered \Na substantial reward to the gang that captures the thieves.
12334,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You must take them alive!
12335,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,There wasn't any merchandise?
12336,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"No, the safe was empty."
12337,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"According to the auctioneer, \Nthe only one who knew the situation, everything in the safe had been \Nmoved a few hours earlier."
12338,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Exactly as though they \Nexpected this to happen.
12339,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Don't you find the timing too perfect?
12340,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We have a...
12341,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Judas among us.
12342,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We have a Judas among us.
12343,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You're saying that one of us is a traitor?
12344,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,There are no traitors.
12345,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Besides, Judas wasn't a traitor."
12346,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's said that Judas sold Jesus out \Nfor thirty pieces of silver.
12347,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,But how much would a traitor ask from the Mafia?
12348,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Consider the merits...
12349,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,What would the traitor gain \Nby selling us to the Mafia?
12350,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Money?
12351,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Glory?
12352,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Prestige?
12353,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Do you truly believe that any of us cares for those things?
12354,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's unlikely...
12355,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You see?
12356,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Besides, something else \Nhere doesn't add up."
12357,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Huh?
12358,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Assuming there were a spy, the response was too tepid."
12359,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"If they had foreknowledge that Class-A bounties would \Nappear at the auction, they would have increased security."
12360,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The auction goers were all \Nuninformed and unarmed.
12361,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That's true.
12362,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I believe that someone provided information \Nthat wasn't explicit.
12363,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"However, a Mafia community leader believed that information."
12364,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I don't get it...
12365,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Who told who what?
12366,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Whatever.
12367,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,So what do we do?
12368,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Did you ask the auctioneer where the merchandise was moved?
12369,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Yeah, but he swore on his life that he didn't know."
12370,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Feitan tortured him, so he wasn't lying."
12371,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,He had the worst luck of them all today.
12372,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Did you get the names of \Nanyone who might know?
12373,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You bet I did.
12374,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"The auction is run by the \NMafia community heads, who lead gangs in each of the \Nten districts around the world."
12375,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,They're called the Ten Dons.
12376,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"This is the only time that all \Nten gather in one place, to discuss business and issue orders."
12377,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Their commands are carried \Nout by a special force, the Shadow Beasts."
12378,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,This squad consists of each \Ndon's best combatants.
12379,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"I see, then..."
12380,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Since the Shadow Beasts weren't \Nguarding the auction house, the Mafia didn't know we were coming."
12381,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That makes sense.
12382,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Then how did they move \Nthe merchandise?
12383,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That's right...
12384,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I heard that a single Shadow Beasts \Nmember turned up at the safe.
12385,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The twenty-five square-meter \Nsafe was packed with items ready to be auctioned off.
12386,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"The Shadow Beast walked in, then \Nwalked right back out, empty-handed."
12387,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,But the safe was emptied.
12388,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"It was a man in sunglasses, \Ncalling himself Owl."
12389,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Nen{\i0
12390,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Probably.
12391,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Surely they noticed after five hundred people disappeared...
12392,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Nen{\i0
12393,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Can we let loose?
12394,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Naturally.
12395,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Put on a show for the pursuers.
12396,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That will draw them out.
12397,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I can't wait...
12398,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Up there!
12399,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's them! They're in a hot air balloon!
12400,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The balloon is moving toward \Nthe Gordeau Desert!
12401,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We're in pursuit!
12402,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Hot air balloon?
12403,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Not an airship?
12404,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Then what became of the \Nhundreds of guests?
12405,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's possible that we aren't dealing with an ordinary band of armed thugs.
12406,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Contact the Ten Dons.
12407,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Ask them to immediately \Ndispatch the Shadow Beasts!
12408,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Hurry, they're headed for \Nthe Gordeau Desert."
12409,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Okay!
12410,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Roger that.
12411,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Come down here!
12412,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We'll even let you decide whether \Nyou'll be drowned or buried!
12413,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,There's a whole crowd...
12414,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"I don't have to suck them up, do I?"
12415,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"No, they don't matter."
12416,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Hey!
12417,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Stay out of this.
12418,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I'll handle it...
12419,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Wait!
12420,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Are you the ones who \Nkidnapped the guests?
12421,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Yeah.
12422,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Well, you do have guts."
12423,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Who's your leader?
12424,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Bastard.
12425,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,His philosophy is to be the strongest of them all...
12426,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,An ordinary gun wouldn't \Neven scratch him.
12427,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Physically, he's the strongest."
12428,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,It's like watching a gorilla stomping ants.
12429,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Oh?
12430,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,More of them.
12431,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"They came all the way here, \Nmerely to be killed."
12432,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Just watching isn't any fun.
12433,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Let's play cards.
12434,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Yes.
12435,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I agree.
12436,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Boss!
12437,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That wasn't enough to warm me \Nup for the Shadow Beasts.
12438,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Ow...
12439,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,A rifle?
12440,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,How annoying.
12441,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Trying to take me out from afar?
12442,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Yeah! Bull's-eye!
12443,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That's enough!
12444,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"Don't get too cocky, monster."
12445,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,This super-bazooka is strong \Nenough to take out a tank.
12446,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You'll be blown to smithereens!
12447,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,How sad...
12448,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,You're comparing me \Nto some little tank?
12449,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Die!
12450,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Did I get him?
12451,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,That kinda hurt...
12452,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,None of you will escape!
12453,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Nen{\i0
12454,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,And he's ridiculously strong.
12455,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The advance force was obliterated.
12456,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Guns are ineffective against him.
12457,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Impossible...
12458,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,See for yourself.
12459,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,His aura is unbelievable.
12460,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,As is the number of corpses.
12461,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Who is that guy?
12462,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,He's tearing through people \Nlike scraps of paper.
12463,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We're supposed to capture him?
12464,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I won't be part of that!
12465,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I agree.
12466,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I don't see how we can win...
12467,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Indeed.
12468,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"However, we cannot abandon \Nour mission and back off."
12469,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,But...
12470,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Wait.
12471,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I suddenly hear an additional \Nheartbeat coming from somewhere...
12472,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"I am Worm, a Shadow Beast."
12473,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Which group do you belong to?
12474,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,We're bodyguards for \Nthe Nostrade Family.
12475,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,I see.
12476,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Nen{\i0 but don't bother.
12477,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,These aren't ordinary thugs.
12478,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,"To them, taking lives is like breathing."
12479,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,Y-You could say they're \Nprofessional killers.

12486,A x Shocking x Tragedy.,43,The Mafia community has \Nunleashed the Shadow Beasts on the bandits who attacked the auction.

12561,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Nine.
12562,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Ten.
12563,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Okay, who's dying next?"
12564,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"The Phantom Troupe, huh?"
12565,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He sounds pretty confident.
12566,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You're the one who will die next!
12567,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Fool.
12568,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Nice...
12569,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I like reckless opponents.
12570,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,But you're still going to die!
12571,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I can manipulate my body hair at will.
12572,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"I can even turn it into hard spikes, yup."
12573,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"You throw a strong punch, but it's meaningless if \Nyou can't connect, yup."
12574,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,They managed to damage
12575,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Uvogin's iron skin with nothing \Nbut body hair and teeth.
12576,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Nen{\i0
12577,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I'm impressed.
12578,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Thirteen.
12579,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,No way!
12580,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Sorry.
12581,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Want a hand, Uvo?"
12582,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Keep out of this!
12583,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Damn it...
12584,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,It's futile.
12585,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"You can't shake off thousands of spikes once they've penetrated your skin, yup."
12586,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Then I'll use you as my fist!
12587,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Since I can manipulate it at will,"
12588,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"I can relax certain sections of \Nmy body hair as necessary, yup."
12589,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,We've got Muscles on the ropes.
12590,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,That's bull.
12591,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You're damned tough.
12592,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Did it finally kick in?
12593,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,My fangs secrete a tranquilizer that's meant to instantly incapacitate you...
12594,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Bastard...
12595,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Everything from the neck up is unaffected, so you can still feel pain and fear."
12596,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,So sit back and enjoy.
12597,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"If he were using a lethal poison, \Nthis fight would be over."
12598,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I'm sure he likes to torture opponents.
12599,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I keep numerous leeches \Nof all sizes within me...
12600,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"They'll enter your body \Nthrough your wounds, and deposit their eggs in your bladder."
12601,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,These spotted leeches are \Na gift from me to you.
12602,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You're totally disgusting!
12603,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Most people die from the \Nexcruciating pain of hundreds of millions of leeches as they hatch inside their bodies.
12604,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Yuck.
12605,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I thought that uglier usually \Nmeant better-tasting.
12606,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Why are you surprised?
12607,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You aren't the only one \Nwho can use his teeth.
12608,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Everything from my neck up \Nis all I need to defeat you.
12609,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,They're going to lose...
12610,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The Shadow Beasts will lose.
12611,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,They're going to lose...
12612,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The Shadow Beasts will lose.
12613,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Defeat us?
12614,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Heh.
12615,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You can't bite me when I'm \Nall the way over here.
12616,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,A bullet?
12617,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,No...
12618,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,It's a fragment of Leech's \Nskull that he bit off!
12619,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He's going to do the same to me?
12620,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,But it won't work...
12621,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"My body hair will repel \Nany projectile, yup."
12622,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Huh?
12623,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"You can't repel sound projectiles, can you?"
12624,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Oh, you can't hear me anymore?"
12625,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He used sound to defeat \Na Shadow Beast.
12626,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,They're all crazy...
12627,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You idiot!
12628,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Give us a warning first!
12629,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,What if our eardrums had burst?
12630,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Sorry about that!
12631,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,But that would've given my plan away.
12632,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Besides, you guys had plenty \Nof time to cover your ears before the sound reached you."
12633,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,That's true.
12634,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Wait, Kurapika!"
12635,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,What are you doing?
12636,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Shouldn't that be obvious?
12637,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I'm going to capture him.
12638,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,It's impossible!
12639,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You saw what he's capable of!
12640,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You're going to get yourself killed!
12641,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Kurapika!
12642,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I really don't care.
12643,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I hear tremendous rage and hatred.
12644,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He's completely lost control.
12645,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Kurapika!
12646,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He will definitely get himself killed.
12647,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I cannot leave him in this state.
12648,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Stop, Kurapika!"
12649,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Wild Flower.
12650,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The perfect song to relax you.
12651,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Has everyone calmed down?
12652,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Let's cool our heads, and devise a plan together."
12653,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Y-Yeah...
12654,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,What kind of abilities do the \Nother members possess?
12655,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I bet they're all ridiculously strong...
12656,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Melody...
12657,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Hmm?
12658,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Thank you.
12659,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I've cooled down now.
12660,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"However, I still must capture them."
12661,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Leader,"
12662,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I can make this happen.
12663,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,What?
12664,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Let me go.
12665,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"After witnessing that \Nincredible show of strength, you still believe you can defeat him?"
12666,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Of course.
12667,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I understand.
12668,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Bring the car, so we can \Nleave at a moment's notice."
12669,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,R-Right.
12670,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Shizuku!
12671,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Would you suck the poison and \Nleeches from my body?
12672,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Your vacuum will do the trick.
12673,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Blinky can suck out poison, \Nbut nothing alive."
12674,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,What?
12675,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Then what am I supposed to do?
12676,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Let me see.
12677,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,This is a spotted leech...
12678,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"It takes one day to migrate to the bladder, before laying its eggs and dying."
12679,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,So?
12680,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"The eggs will hatch shortly after, \Nexiting through your urinary tract."
12681,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,It will cause enough pain to kill you.
12682,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Hey, don't joke around..."
12683,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"However, they require a specific \Nammonia level to hatch."
12684,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"If there isn't enough, the eggs don't hatch, and they \Ncan be excreted harmlessly."
12685,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"So, until this time tomorrow, you should drink beer non-stop, \Nand be sure to urinate frequently!"
12686,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Don't scare me like that...
12687,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Shizuku, can you take care of the poison?"
12688,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Yes.
12689,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Someone go to the city \Nand get lots of beer.
12690,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I'll go.
12691,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Make sure they're ice-cold!
12692,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Don't get too greedy!
12693,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Okay, get that poison out of me."
12694,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Huh?
12695,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Did you see that?
12696,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Yeah.
12697,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Those chains came from nowhere, \Nto wrap around his body."
12698,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Is it a new Shadow Beast?
12699,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Uvo can't move because of the tranquilizer, and the leeches are still inside him."
12700,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Then that's that... \NLet's go and save him.
12701,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Good grief.
12702,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He's so much trouble.
12703,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I have a trace for now.
12704,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,In{\i0
12705,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Gyo{\i0
12706,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I can follow them anywhere.
12707,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Okay, let's find them \Nbefore they notice it."
12708,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,This is our chance to finish the \Nremaining Shadow Beasts.
12709,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Franklin, we're counting on you \Nto bring back lots of beer."
12710,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Man, the chase sounds more fun..."
12711,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Let's go!
12712,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Indeed.
12713,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The spiders...
12714,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,We'd need all the remaining members just to stand a chance...
12715,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Understood.
12716,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Chains...
12717,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Hey, driver..."
12718,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,You think these chains can hold me?
12719,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"If you don't kill me now, \Nyou'll regret it later."
12720,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Shut up.
12721,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Don't you understand?
12722,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,This is a golden opportunity.
12723,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Stop wasting time, and just..."
12724,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I told you to shut up!
12725,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Kurapika, watch..."
12726,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Watch the road!
12727,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,How can he be this strong?
12728,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Even if my body weren't paralyzed, \NI'd still be having trouble..."
12729,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,He's put enough Nen into these chains to keep a master Enhancer in check?
12730,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Chain Jail.
12731,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Chain Jail: \NThe Restraining Middle Finger

12734,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,I've sworn to use this ability \Nfor no other purpose.

12736,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,A self-imposed restriction.
12737,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"A self-imposed restriction, \Nand a covenant with myself."
12738,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,A self-imposed restriction. \NA covenant with myself.
12739,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The proof of my resolve.
12740,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Look out, Kurapika..."
12741,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,The risk is high.
12742,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,Watch the road!
12743,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"But the stronger my resolve, the stronger my Nen!"
12744,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Kurapika has captured a member of the Phantom Troupe, his sworn enemies."
12745,Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!,44,"Armed with resolve and the \Nwillingness to risk his life, an intense battle is about to begin."

12777,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Indeed...
12778,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Think it's them?
12779,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Kurapika, floor it!"
12780,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It's a tail!
12781,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,A tail?
12782,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But who?
12783,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Could it be?
12784,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,A thread!
12785,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Nen{\i0
12786,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,There's something on his left thigh.
12787,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Damn!
12788,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,They noticed it.
12789,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That was faster than expected.
12790,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Don't worry. \NWe've almost got them!
12791,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Whatever...
12792,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?
12793,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It's just a little longer.
12794,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Fun Fun Cloth: \NConvenient Magic Kerchief
12795,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What the hell?
12796,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Hey!
12797,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Let me out, damn it!"
12798,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You guys really are good.
12799,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Given that you were fast enough to open the door \Nand escape in moments.
12800,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'll need to take care.
12801,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Nobunaga had an unlucky position...
12802,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Anyway, you have an interesting ability."
12803,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Let me out, damn it!"
12804,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You can shrink anything merely \Nby using that cloth?
12805,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That would be quite handy for theft.
12806,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"With that thing, you could fit all \Nof the treasure in your pocket."
12807,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Meaning that he's the one \Nwho took the treasure from the auction house.
12808,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"And so, you can also restore \Neverything to its original size."
12809,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I believe the boss said he's named Owl.
12810,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,His friends have arrived to help.
12811,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Yes...
12812,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,There are quite a few of them.
12813,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Who are these guys?
12814,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Are they really Phantom Troupe members?
12815,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Yeah, definitely."
12816,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But they look so weak.
12817,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"One, two, three..."
12818,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Huh?
12819,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What's wrong?
12820,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?"
12821,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Uvo took care of four, so this should be the rest."
12822,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That is strange.
12823,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"The chain user grabbed Uvo, \Nbefore escaping by car."
12824,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Does that mean the chain \Nuser isn't a Shadow Beast?
12825,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Well, we'll know once we ask them..."
12826,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Should we keep them all alive?
12827,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"No, we require only Owl."
12828,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Then I'll handle that.
12829,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Those damned kids are talking smack.
12830,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Let's show them how scary the \NShadow Beasts can be.
12831,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Did you hear that?
12832,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Shalnark, you just stand \Nthere and watch."
12833,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'll take three.
12834,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Shizuku can have the other two.
12835,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Got it.
12836,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Don't get cocky!
12837,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Keep your cool!
12838,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Don't underestimate their strength!
12839,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Shut up!
12840,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We lost them.
12841,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But what was it that I just saw landing on the roof of their car?
12842,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Probably one of the \Nremaining Shadow Beasts.
12843,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,This is our chance to \Nhurry back to the city.
12844,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Roger that.
12845,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We'll switch the location to pattern C.
12846,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"And we don't want Muscles \Nhere putting up a fight, so we'll need muscle relaxants \Nand sleeping gas."
12847,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I hope those will work...
12848,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Move, and you'll get cut."
12849,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Okay, all done."
12850,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What about the bodies?
12851,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Just leave them.
12852,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No point hiding them now.
12853,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Okay, let's free Nobunaga before we start torturing this guy."
12854,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Hold on.
12855,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?"
12856,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"There's no room, so let's \Nleave Nobunaga as he is."
12857,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Screw that! Let me out!
12858,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"I don't want to be cramped, either."
12859,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Come on!
12860,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Hey, can you release the car alone?"
12861,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I know you can hear me!
12862,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You're really making me mad!
12863,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Th-That's impossible...
12864,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Let me out, already!"
12865,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Too bad.
12866,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,So much for that...
12867,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Hey! What's going on?
12868,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You bastards were making a fool out of me!
12869,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Troupe members aren't \Nsupposed to snap at one other.
12870,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Shut up!
12871,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Anyway, this ability could come \Nin handy for our job."
12872,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Shut your mouth!
12873,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'm cutting this guy to shreds!
12874,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No.
12875,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He's going to tell us \Nwhere the treasure is...
12876,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.
12877,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You just have bad luck.
12878,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Damn it!
12879,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Hey, wake up!"
12880,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You understand what's happening here?
12881,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Where did you put the \Nstolen merchandise?
12882,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What time is it?
12883,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,How long have I been asleep?
12884,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It seems that you don't grasp \Nyour current situation.
12885,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'm asking the questions here!
12886,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Incredible mental fortitude...
12887,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"He's well aware that he's \Nabout to be tortured, but the aura around his \Nbody remains firm."
12888,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That iron body is built \Non a rock-solid spirit.
12889,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That is why his aura is so strong.
12890,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The product of countless battles.
12891,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'm asking the questions here!
12892,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Incredible mental fortitude...
12893,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"He's well aware that he's \Nabout to be tortured, but the aura around his \Nbody remains firm."
12894,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That iron body is built \Non a rock-solid spirit.
12895,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That is why his aura is so strong.
12896,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The product of countless battles.
12897,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Can I move?
12898,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No...
12899,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I won't recover for a while.
12900,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I had dinner around 8.
12901,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Judging by my stomach, \Nit's around midnight now."
12902,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Let's make a deal.
12903,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"I'll spare your lives, so let me up now."
12904,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Wh-What is he saying?
12905,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Is he insane?!
12906,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He's serious.
12907,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I think.
12908,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What? Are you crazy?
12909,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He's the one who should \Nbe begging for his life.
12910,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Let me make something clear.
12911,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We're after the auction merchandise \Nthat was stored underground.
12912,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"If you guys don't know where it is,"
12913,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I have no business with you.
12914,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What?
12915,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Wait a moment.
12916,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You didn't steal the merchandise?
12917,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The safe was empty when we arrived.
12918,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The Shadow Beasts had \Nalready taken it all.
12919,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I guess they didn't bother \Ntelling grunts like you.
12920,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I don't think he's lying...
12921,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Then he's serious?
12922,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"When he offered to make a \Ndeal, he wasn't bluffing?"
12923,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Everyone makes mistakes...
12924,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We haven't stolen anything yet.
12925,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"So take these off, and pretend you didn't see anything."
12926,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"If you do that, you get to live!"
12927,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What about the guests?
12928,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Guests?
12929,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The guests who were in the auction hall.
12930,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Some of our colleagues were there.
12931,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Answer me.
12932,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I see.
12933,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That's too bad...
12934,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We killed them.
12935,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It was part of our plan—
12936,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,How many lives do you think you took to carry out that plan of yours?!
12937,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Stop, Kurapika!"
12938,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Stop it!
12939,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"If the merchandise is in safe hands, we don't need him."
12940,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We'll hand him over to the community.
12941,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"So, no deal?"
12942,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Oh, did you find out what \Nbecame of the merchandise?"
12943,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Shut up! Ask Feitan!
12944,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Did he tell you where the merchandise is?
12945,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It was no fun...
12946,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in."
12947,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Oh, so that's it."
12948,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Ah, I just remembered."
12949,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I was supposed to meet someone today.
12950,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'll be heading out.
12951,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Sure, go ahead."
12952,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.
12953,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Up to some mischief, Hisoka?"
12954,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But of course.
12955,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Damn...
12956,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"""Let us meet at the agreed upon place."""
12957,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Where's Shalnark?
12958,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He just called.
12959,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He's succeeded in locating \Na Mafia comms room.
12960,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.
12961,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We've captured one of the bandits \Nwho attacked the auction and wish to hand him over.
12962,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Really?
12963,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,How did you manage that?
12964,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I can provide further details later.
12965,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,That's impressive...
12966,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.
12967,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?
12968,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Yeah, they were completely wiped out."
12969,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Wiped out...
12970,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Well, where are you right now?"
12971,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Okay, got it."
12972,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Move quickly.
12973,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Yeah, we'll bring our best people."
12974,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I gave him three canisters \Nof muscle relaxants.
12975,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Understood.
12976,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The Mafia will be here soon.
12977,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"I'll watch him until then, \Nso get some rest, everyone."
12978,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Yeah.
12979,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You move fast.
12980,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He isn't using{\i0
12981,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No need for concern.
12982,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I have no interest in fighting you now...
12983,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'm not here for idle chat!
12984,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Tell me about your organization.
12985,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Really?
12986,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I love idle chat.
12987,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"There are thirteen spiders, identifiable by their \Nnumbered spider tattoos."
12988,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Members can change at \Na moment's notice.
12989,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,An applicant defeating a standing \Nmember replaces them.
12990,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"If the Troupe loses one for other reasons, the boss selects the replacement."
12991,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The Troupe focuses primarily \Non stealing and killing.
12992,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Sometimes, they perform \Nphilanthropic work."
12993,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I already know all of that.
12994,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Two or three years ago,"
12995,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I replaced the man who was #4.
12996,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,For what purpose?
12997,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,So that I could fight the boss.
12998,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,The boss?
12999,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Why would you want that?
13000,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Because he is strong...
13001,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You wished to test your strength?
13002,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Perhaps.
13003,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But...
13004,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It turns me on...
13005,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Thinking about fighting the boss...
13006,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,But I've never had the chance.
13007,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He never lowers his guard.
13008,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"At a minimum, two others \Nalways accompany him."
13009,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"And when a job ends, he vanishes."
13010,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Without a trace.
13011,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,So I reached a conclusion \Nthat benefits us both.
13012,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Would you not agree that reaching \Nour goals alone will be difficult?
13013,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What are you trying to say?
13014,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.
13015,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,There are seven whose \Npowers I already know.
13016,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Interested... in teaming up?
13017,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Yeah, we're on floor B2."
13018,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Thanks.
13019,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You haven't killed him yet?
13020,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No.
13021,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,This way.
13022,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"We couldn't get a needle into him, so we used paralytic gas."
13023,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You clean up nicely.
13024,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Huh?
13025,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I couldn't believe my ears when I heard you'd been kidnapped.
13026,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Blinky, time for work."
13027,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.
13028,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Okay, all done."
13029,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Damn!
13030,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I'm gonna make that chain user pay...
13031,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Wake up, everyone!"
13032,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Where is he?!
13033,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He ran away.
13034,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You were too loud.
13035,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We're heading back.
13036,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Our job here is done.
13037,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.
13038,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,And we got our treasure.
13039,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,No!
13040,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Tell the boss...
13041,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,I won't go back until I settle up with that chain user.
13042,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Uvogin has been freed.
13043,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up, is not yet aware of this."
13044,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
13045,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
13046,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
13047,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Hunterpedia!
13048,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,It's Gon and Killua's
13049,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Hunterpedia!
13050,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
13051,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Today, we introduce Dalzollene."
13052,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Leads Neon's bodyguards.
13053,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!
13054,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"A cruel, impatient man who disposes \Nof any who fail to follow orders."
13055,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!
13056,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"It's a drag for me, taking care of you."
13057,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,What are you on about?!
13058,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.
13059,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"Hey, Killua, let's play Drop the Handkerchief."
13060,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,"I'll drop it, and you sit and wait."
13061,Restraint x And x Vow!,45,You can't play that with two people!
13062,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Tell the boss...
13063,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I won't go back until I settle up with that chain user.
13064,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Chasing x And x Waiting
13065,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Hisoka, who joined the Phantom Troupe for a chance to fight the leader, Chrollo, has proposed that Kurapika, \Nwho seeks revenge on the Troupe, join forces with him."
13066,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Well? It's your call.
13067,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Will you work with me?
13068,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Or will you fight alone?
13069,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Go ahead.
13070,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It's me.
13071,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Kurapika, it's terrible..."
13072,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The man we captured has escaped.
13073,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Escaped? On his own?
13074,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"No, some Troupe members disguised themselves as \NMafia and came for him."
13075,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What about the leader?
13076,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We've been unable to reach him.
13077,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We're heading toward pattern B.
13078,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Return immediately.
13079,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I understand.
13080,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Hisoka, I have a question for you."
13081,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Do you know what became \Nof the Scarlet Eyes?
13082,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Unfortunately, that was \Nfrom before I joined."
13083,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The boss sells every item after \Nadmiring it for a while.
13084,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The Scarlet Eyes should be no exception.
13085,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That is all I know.
13086,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,But keep this in mind.
13087,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,A spider will not stop moving \Nuntil you crush its head.
13088,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I asked if you wanted to team up, but I was not suggesting that \Nwe fight side by side."
13089,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Merely that we exchange information, \Nin a give-and-take relationship."
13090,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"If it ceases to be beneficial to either party, there will be no further \Nobligation to cooperate."
13091,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Simple enough, yes?"
13092,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What do you say?
13093,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I'll be here tomorrow, \Nat the same time."
13094,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"So, what do we do now?"
13095,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The leader is probably dead.
13096,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,And we haven't completed the mission...
13097,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Shouldn't we report this to the boss?
13098,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That little girl's our boss in name alone.
13099,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It was someone else who hired us.
13100,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Light Nostrade, her father."
13101,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"He gave the orders, and the leader received them."
13102,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,But the leader was the only one \Nwho knew how to contact him.
13103,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It seems we have no choice but to report \Nwhat's happened to the boss.
13104,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Boss... Boss.
13105,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What time is it?
13106,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It's 2 AM.
13107,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh? What about the auction?!
13108,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It's been called off.
13109,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13110,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Called off? Why?
13111,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The auction was attacked by thieves.
13112,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13113,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Baise, Ivlenkov, and Tocino \Ndied during the attack."
13114,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What?
13115,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"We can't reach the leader, \Nso he's probably done for."
13116,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,No way.
13117,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What about the mummy?
13118,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Was it really stolen?
13119,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I wanted it so much...
13120,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The Mafia community moved the \Nmerchandise to a safe location.
13121,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Oh, that's great!"
13122,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,So when is the next auction?
13123,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We don't yet know.
13124,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What? Why not?
13125,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"In any event, the leader \Nhandled all communication, so we don't know anything."
13126,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We cannot act until we have orders.
13127,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I don't know anything about that.
13128,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"So, ask Daddy."
13129,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,His number's on my phone.
13130,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Squala, make the call."
13131,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh? Why me?!
13132,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You're the most experienced member left.
13133,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You should be the leader.
13134,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,No way!
13135,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Out of the question!
13136,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'm not the leader type.
13137,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Perhaps we should take a vote, to be fair?"
13138,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We need to make the call quickly.
13139,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I vote for Kurapika.
13140,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"He was the one who \Napprehended the bandit, and he has shown excellent judgment."
13141,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I believe he would make the best leader.
13142,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,No objections here. \NI vote for Kurapika.
13143,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That's that...
13144,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You make the call.
13145,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I understand.
13146,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"As the interim leader, \NI'll call Mr. Nostrade."
13147,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,This is only until we confirm \Nwhat's become of Dalzollene.
13148,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Any final decision will be \NMr. Nostrade's to make.
13149,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I never expected to get \Na chance so soon...
13150,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"It would be inappropriate for \Nme to call him directly, so would you provide an \Nintroduction, boss?"
13151,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Sure.
13152,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Then, I'm putting him on now."
13153,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Hello?
13154,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Is it true that Dalzollene has been killed?
13155,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yes.
13156,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I find that hard to believe.
13157,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Nen{\i0
13158,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He's trained to withstand ten gunshots without sustaining injury.
13159,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He was killed by a group of outlaws \Nknown as the Phantom Troupe.
13160,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The spiders?
13161,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I had an opportunity to see them in action.
13162,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,One of them stopped a \Nbazooka rocket with one hand.
13163,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I am Kurapika, the interim leader."
13164,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Could you please issue us our orders?
13165,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"First, I'd like to hear your \Nopinion as interim leader."
13166,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I believe we should get your daughter out of \NYorknew City immediately.
13167,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"If anything unexpected happens, we would be unable to protect her."
13168,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I agree with your assessment, \Nbut my daughter also has a say."
13169,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I want to respect her wishes when possible.
13170,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,My top priority is her safety.
13171,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I understand.
13172,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'm on my way now.
13173,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I should arrive by tomorrow evening.
13174,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I shall do my best to persuade Neon.
13175,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"You will be the new leader, Kurapika."
13176,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Here is your first order.
13177,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Keep an eye on Neon until I arrive.
13178,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Understood.
13179,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Your father will arrive tomorrow night.
13180,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Really?
13181,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yay!
13182,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll get him to buy me lots of clothes.
13183,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You are to wait in your room until then.
13184,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What?
13185,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I want to see the casino...
13186,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Stay here with the boss.
13187,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13188,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,S-Sure...
13189,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I'll be downstairs, investigating."
13190,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Here we go!
13191,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That building you were in is owned by a dummy corporation for \Nthe Nostrade Family.
13192,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Can you get a list of buildings the Nostrade Family owns in this area?
13193,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Of course!
13194,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I can also see if anyone's checked \Nin using the Nostrade name.
13195,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Here, I brought more beer."
13196,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Oh, thanks."
13197,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Here.
13198,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"You should get a Hunter License, Uvo."
13199,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"You can get all kinds of \Ninformation from this website, as long as you have the money."
13200,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Unlike you guys, I dislike \Nthe idea of money."
13201,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"If there's something I want, I take it."
13202,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,How splendid...
13203,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You are the model thief!
13204,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Here we go.
13205,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,They own two other buildings.
13206,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,And there are three hotels \Nwhere members are staying...
13207,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Well, this should be a short search."
13208,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Thanks.
13209,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I appreciate it.
13210,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Wh-What was that for?!
13211,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Well, I'm off, then."
13212,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What about the beer?
13213,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You guys can finish it.
13214,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Make sure you dispose of the body.
13215,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Try to make it quick.
13216,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yeah.
13217,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Bye.
13218,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Uvo!
13219,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13220,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Don't get careless.
13221,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yeah.
13222,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Family members?
13223,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll start with them.
13224,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Look at this.
13225,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What's that?
13226,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,A list of buildings owned \Nby the Nostrade Family?
13227,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,There's a list of Family members...
13228,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I didn't know this information was available.
13229,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,This website can only be \Naccessed by pro Hunters.
13230,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"With this information, \Nthey can locate this room."
13231,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,A website for pro Hunters...
13232,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Then if one of the enemies is a pro Hunter...
13233,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We're in big trouble.
13234,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We need to take the boss \Nand find a different room.
13235,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Eh? In the same hotel?
13236,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It's faster and avoids needless movement.
13237,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,But we cannot use fake names.
13238,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We'll have Melody or Basho register the room.
13239,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Make sure everyone, \Nespecially the boss, stays inside."
13240,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Got it.
13241,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Don't check out of this one.
13242,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Kurapika? What about you?
13243,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll stay here.
13244,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13245,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You can't mean to...
13246,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I-I don't think that's a Family member.
13247,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He's a bodyguard for the boss' daughter...
13248,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Daughter?
13249,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yeah...
13250,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,She's a strange one who \Ncollects human body parts.
13251,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Eyeballs and organs...
13252,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Oh, and she's an incredibly \Naccurate fortune teller."
13253,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Fortune teller?
13254,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,She has a long list of Mafia clients...
13255,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Some community elders basically worship her.
13256,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"After all, our boss made his fortune by using \Nhis daughter's power."
13257,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Hey...
13258,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,C-Cut me some slack?
13259,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I told you everything I know.
13260,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Please spare me!
13261,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Someone who can see the future...
13262,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,She knew the attack would happen?
13263,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The boss was right.
13264,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,There weren't any traitors.
13265,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Currently, we have a 3,000,000 diamond and 2,400,000 Jenny in leftover cash."
13266,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"And we also have the 2,750,000 \NJenny from the arm wrestling."
13267,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"That gives us a total of around 8,000,000."
13268,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"We need to turn this into at least 9 billion,"
13269,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Greed Island{\i0
13270,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I don't see how we can manage that \Nthrough legitimate channels.
13271,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I wouldn't call that arm wrestling legitimate.
13272,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,All the challengers toward the end were \Nhalf desperate losers trying for revenge.
13273,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That's fine. \NThat was my goal.
13274,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13275,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We want as many people as \Npossible to embellish the tale.
13276,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What do you mean?
13277,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The arm wrestling was meant as bait.
13278,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Bait?
13279,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,To draw out the moles.
13280,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Moles? Why do we want moles?
13281,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Pipe down now. \NI'll explain everything.
13282,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Come on down!
13283,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Let's have some \Nconditional auctioning fun!
13284,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"We have a diamond worth 3,000,000."
13285,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The winner will be determined \Nthrough arm wrestling.
13286,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The first person to beat this \Nboy wins the diamond.
13287,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"You must pay a 10,000-Jenny entry fee."
13288,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What? He's just a kid.
13289,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll give it a shot.
13290,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Don't bother.
13291,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That kid beat five hundred people yesterday.
13292,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13293,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Over twenty ended up with broken arms.
13294,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Seriously?!
13295,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The stories are spreading nicely.
13296,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,In that case...
13297,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Move.
13298,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Oh, do we have our first challenger?"
13299,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,No.
13300,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13301,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I already know that my man \Ncan't beat your kid.
13302,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I was watching yesterday.
13303,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Then what do you want?
13304,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Interested in making some real money?
13305,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Meaning?
13306,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I know where you can make big bucks instead of the pocket change \Nyou're getting here.
13307,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You can make hundreds...
13308,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"No, thousands of times more."
13309,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Are they moles?
13310,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yeah, looks like we landed a big fish."
13311,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh? Fish?
13312,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Don't you mean moles?
13313,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Stop talking. \NIt doesn't matter!
13314,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Here we are.
13315,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Oh! I can feel the bloodlust.
13316,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"The arm wrestling competition here \Naccepts all comers, and it pays out."
13317,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"The spectators bet on each match, and the winner receives ten \Npercent of all bets placed."
13318,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We're talking billions bet on each match.
13319,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That would mean millions with each win!
13320,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You could win even more...
13321,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll be taking fifty percent of your \Nearnings as my commission.
13322,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Fifty percent? Isn't that a little high?
13323,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You can't participate \Nunless I enter your name.
13324,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Besides, you can bet your own money."
13325,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"You'll get great odds with that kid, and earn back your stake \Na hundred times over."
13326,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That's right! I'm in!
13327,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Go, Gon!"
13328,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13329,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Well? Any other challengers?
13330,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Got one right here!
13331,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,This kid's up for the challenge.
13332,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Very well.
13333,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Sorry, but the arm wrestling is canceled!"
13334,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We'll be doing some \Nconditional auctioning now!
13335,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Why was it canceled?
13336,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"U-Uh, I don't know."
13337,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"To win, you must play \Nhide-and-seek!"
13338,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Hide-and-seek?
13339,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We'll start by passing out flyers!
13340,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Examine the pictures on the flyer.
13341,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Those seven people are your targets!
13342,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Hey, that girl with glasses was..."
13343,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yep, she arm wrestled me."
13344,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Hey, are they the ones responsible \Nfor what happened last night?"
13345,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yeah, you mean the attack on the auction?"
13346,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"In order to win the bid, you must capture and deliver a target to us."
13347,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"For each target brought in, you will receive a nice sum of 2 billion Jenny!"
13348,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,There is no time limit.
13349,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It doesn't matter if the \Ntarget is dead or alive.
13350,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Please contact us once \Nyou've captured one!
13351,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Two billion each?
13352,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"If we catch them all, we'd have 14 billion!"
13353,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It'll cost you 5 million Jenny to participate!
13354,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"We're joining in, right?"
13355,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Yeah...
13356,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yeah, that's right. \NI'll fax you the information."
13357,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Search the Net for information.
13358,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We'll pay for anything concrete.
13359,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,We need to hurry.
13360,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,There's no rush.
13361,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,They won't be able to catch our targets.
13362,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Huh?
13363,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"After all, the Mafia's having \Ntrouble handling them."
13364,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What do you mean?
13365,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,This conditional auction is \Nnothing but a bounty hunt.
13366,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"In other words, the Mafia is admitting that, alone, \Nit can't capture these targets."
13367,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,You have a point...
13368,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,They were willing to suspend \Neverything to track them down.
13369,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I just heard that the underground \N auction was attacked last night.
13370,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The underground auction?!
13371,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Was it them?
13372,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,That's why there's a \Nreward for their heads?
13373,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yep, they must be nuts to \Nsteal from the Mafia."
13374,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,And we already know who would \Nbe crazy enough for that.
13375,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,The Phantom Troupe!
13376,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Oh, right..."
13377,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,What's Kurapika up to?
13378,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"Yeah, he should be in the city, but he hasn't made contact."
13379,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll call him.
13380,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He isn't answering.
13381,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Is he working?
13382,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Working?
13383,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I heard that he's been \Nworking as a bodyguard.
13384,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Probably for some VIP...
13385,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"He's trying to track down the Scarlet Eyes, so it must be someone in the underworld."
13386,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"What if he was guarding that \Nperson at the auction house, and got caught up in the attack?"
13387,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He wouldn't have been \Ncaught up in the attack.
13388,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"If the Troupe attacked, he'd be \Nactively tracking them down."
13389,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,It's possible that he's already \Ncaptured two or three.
13390,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I hope you're right...
13391,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Alone?
13392,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'm impressed.
13393,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Where do you want to die?
13394,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,I'll humor any requests.
13395,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,"I'd prefer a deserted wasteland, \Nwith no one nearby."
13396,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Since I'll have you screaming \Nat the top of your lungs.
13397,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Uvogin has come to avenge his \Ncapture and restore his pride.
13398,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,And Kurapika has been waiting for the chance to exact revenge \Nupon the Phantom Troupe.
13399,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Their battle is about to start.

13412,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,He's a Manipulator.

13414,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Meow!
13415,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Woof!
13416,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Next time: Condition x And x Condition.
13417,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,Explain the difference in thirty words.
13418,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,A condition is a rule.
13419,Chasing x And x Waiting.,46,A condition is a covenant with yourself!
13420,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Alone?
13421,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm impressed.
13422,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Where do you want to die?
13423,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'll humor any requests.
13424,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"I'd prefer a deserted wasteland, \Nwith no one nearby."
13425,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Since I'll have you screaming \Nat the top of your lungs.
13426,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Condition x And x Condition
13427,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Uvogin seeks to unleash \Nhis rage upon Kurapika.
13428,Condition x And x Condition.,47,And Kurapika intends to avenge his brethren against \Nthe Phantom Troupe.
13429,Condition x And x Condition.,47,An inevitable battle is about to begin.
13430,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Yep, there they all go."
13431,Condition x And x Condition.,47,All of these are leech eggs?
13432,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's disgusting...
13433,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Sorry about the wait.
13434,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I've got a question for you.
13435,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Who are you?
13436,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nen{\i0
13437,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nen{\i0
13438,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Before I can answer your question,"
13439,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I need you to tell me something.
13440,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Do you remember the \Npeople you've killed?
13441,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A little.
13442,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I can remember the people \Nwho made an impression.
13443,Condition x And x Condition.,47,So you want revenge?
13444,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Who are you trying to avenge?
13445,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The Kurta.
13446,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Never heard of them.
13447,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"A small clan, with Scarlet Eyes, \Nthat lived in the Lukso Province."
13448,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Five years ago, you attacked us."
13449,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Scarlet Eyes? What's that?
13450,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The name of a treasure?
13451,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Sorry, doesn't ring a bell..."
13452,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"But five years ago, \NI was definitely a member."
13453,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"When you kill a completely \Ninnocent bystander, what are you people thinking?"
13454,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What do you feel?
13455,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nothing at all.
13456,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Scum!
13457,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You will atone through death!
13458,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Fools like you are the reason \NI never get sick of killing.
13459,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Wanna know what I enjoy most?
13460,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Denying those who come \Nin search of revenge!
13461,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Those chains are dangerous.
13462,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"I don't know what kind \Nof trick he used on them, but they hold an abnormal amount of {\i0"
13463,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Which means...
13464,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Strike first to win!
13465,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Got him.
13466,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's a surprise...
13467,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"After taking that punch, \Nhe still has the strength to attack?"
13468,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But his left arm is useless now.
13469,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What?
13470,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Unscathed?
13471,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Impossible...
13472,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Considering the amount \Nof{\i0 he must be a Manipulator or a Conjurer...
13473,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I would guess the former.
13474,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But only an Enhancer should be \Nable to block my attack.
13475,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What is he?
13476,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Was that punch the best you've got?
13477,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That wasn't even funny.
13478,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Don't worry.
13479,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That was twenty percent of my strength.
13480,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"This time, I'll use half!"
13481,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Here!
13482,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Damn!
13483,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Here!
13484,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Damn, he keeps darting around."
13485,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But...
13486,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'll regret not using that \Nchance to chain you up?
13487,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Stop making excuses, \Nand give me your best shot."
13488,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You're wasting my time.
13489,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Okay, kid."
13490,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'll give you all I've got!
13491,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's an incredible aura.
13492,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A smoke screen?
13493,Condition x And x Condition.,47,His presence has disappeared.
13494,Condition x And x Condition.,47,He's using {\i0
13495,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"This time, I crushed your arm."
13496,Condition x And x Condition.,47,No one can withstand a full-strength Big Bang Impact.
13497,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But I'm impressed.
13498,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You reacted immediately.
13499,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm guessing you noticed the \Nslight shift in the smoke.
13500,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"I am impressed, as well."
13501,Condition x And x Condition.,47,In{\i0
13502,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Striking the ground to \Nraise a smoke screen was intended to conceal both your \Nphysical body and your presence.
13503,Condition x And x Condition.,47,However...
13504,Condition x And x Condition.,47,In{\i0
13505,Condition x And x Condition.,47,N-No way!
13506,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You can see them?
13507,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Gyo{\i0
13508,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nen{\i0
13509,Condition x And x Condition.,47,In{\i0
13510,Condition x And x Condition.,47,So you kept the chains out to trick us into thinking they were real?
13511,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Precisely.
13512,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nen{\i0 so my enemies would only be \Nalert to the visible chains.
13513,Condition x And x Condition.,47,And my bluff just paid off.
13514,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"While you were making empty threats, my chains were already \Nwrapped around your body."
13515,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You've been captured.
13516,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Damn... But how?
13517,Condition x And x Condition.,47,He has an Enhancer's defensive power...
13518,Condition x And x Condition.,47,And the {\i0
13519,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Has he fully mastered both \NEnhancer and Conjurer techniques?
13520,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's impossible.

13525,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I see you're having trouble understanding.
13526,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Let me illuminate you, before \Nsending you to the other side."
13527,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Those eyes...
13528,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I remember now.
13529,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"There were a bunch of them, \Nin the middle of nowhere."
13530,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The boss really liked those eyes.
13531,Condition x And x Condition.,47,They were pretty strong!
13532,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Then, you're a survivor?"
13533,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm getting fired up...
13534,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Let's see which is stronger, your grudge or my power!"
13535,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Bastard...
13536,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Is that all you can think about?
13537,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You'll never be able to break these chains!
13538,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Why? What's wrong?
13539,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"When my eyes turn scarlet, \NI become a Specialist."
13540,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What was that?
13541,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"When I am a Specialist,"
13542,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Nen{\i0

13547,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Absolute Mastery\NEmperor Time
13548,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Emperor Time!
13549,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Chains?
13550,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Yes, when I heard about conjuring, that was the first thing that came to mind."
13551,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Chains, huh..."
13552,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Why's that?
13553,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Because there's evil running \Nloose that needs to be chained down to hell.
13554,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Really, now?"
13555,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I get the feeling that you're \Nactually just chaining yourself.
13556,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What would you know?
13557,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Hey! Wait up!
13558,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm your teacher!
13559,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm not finished talking!
13560,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Hold it right there...
13561,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Didn't you hear my explanation?
13562,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Conjuring ordinary chains is pointless!
13563,Condition x And x Condition.,47,And conjuring unbreakable \Nchains is impossible!
13564,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Ignoring me?
13565,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Man, you're so stubborn."
13566,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It's impossible to conjure unbreakable chains.
13567,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But it's possible to conjure \Nsomething very close.
13568,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Really?!
13569,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Yeah, you only hear what you want to hear."
13570,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What do I need?
13571,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A condition and a condition.
13572,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A condition and a condition?
13573,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Yes, determine a condition... in other words, a rule... and swear to always follow it."
13574,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"The stricter the rule, the stronger \Nthe power it will enable."
13575,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Normally,{\i0"

13577,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But a {\i0
13578,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Your strength will increase exponentially.
13579,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Come up with a rule for your chains.
13580,Condition x And x Condition.,47,One that you are prepared to follow.
13581,Condition x And x Condition.,47,But let me warn you...
13582,Condition x And x Condition.,47,This technique is very volatile.
13583,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It's a double-edged sword.
13584,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"If you break the rule you set, \Nyou could lose your {\i0"
13585,Condition x And x Condition.,47,My objective is to find my brethren's Scarlet Eyes and to capture the spiders.
13586,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"I want chains that are unbreakable by the spiders, \Nthe Phantom Troupe."
13587,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The spiders will be my only targets.
13588,Condition x And x Condition.,47,So the rule is that you will use these \Nchains solely for that objective?
13589,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's a little weak.
13590,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Don't get ahead of me.
13591,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Using the chains exclusively on \Nspiders is only the prerequisite.
13592,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Then what is your rule?
13593,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'll stake my life on it!
13594,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Hey, Kurapika..."
13595,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"When your eyes are scarlet, \Nyour aura spikes."
13596,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Could that mean...
13597,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Let's try water divination again!
13598,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A Specialist?
13599,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You have full control over \Nevery other category?
13600,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That is correct.
13601,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Holy Chain: Healing Thumb
13602,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I can use enhanced self-healing to completely recover a broken arm.
13603,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"I shattered that arm, but he healed it instantly."
13604,Condition x And x Condition.,47,There were a number of reasons why \NI chose you to be my first target.
13605,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"While you fought the Mafia \Nand the Shadow Beasts, the other spiders stayed out of it altogether."
13606,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"That told me you preferred to fight alone, and that they trusted that \Nyour strength would prevail."
13607,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I prefer to fight one-on-one.
13608,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That made you a perfect target.
13609,Condition x And x Condition.,47,An Enhancer who was confident \Nin his offense and defense.
13610,Condition x And x Condition.,47,You met every condition I \Nrequired for my first target.
13611,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Because then I could test if my Chain Jail would be effective on the rest of the Troupe.
13612,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Zetsu{\i0
13613,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It also paralyzes them.
13614,Condition x And x Condition.,47,So that's why I can't muster any aura...
13615,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Zetsu{\i0
13616,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Meaning you'd need to use physical strength alone to break these chains.
13617,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Damn!
13618,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"If the Troupe member with the most \Nphysical strength cannot break the chains, the others will certainly be \Nunable to escape Chain Jail."
13619,Condition x And x Condition.,47,His forced activation of{\i0
13620,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Aura is the basis of all {\i0
13621,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"If it's sealed off, you can't use your power."
13622,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A technique for sealing {\i0
13623,Condition x And x Condition.,47,This guy thought everything through.
13624,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It looks as though my enhanced fist is slightly stronger than your physical brawn.
13625,Condition x And x Condition.,47,That's valuable information.
13626,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Then I can beat every Troupe member \Nbarehanded, provided I've chained them."
13627,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Tell me everything you know.
13628,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Where are the other spiders?
13629,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Kill me.
13630,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What abilities do they have?
13631,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Kill me.
13632,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It makes me sick...
13633,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The sensation left on my hand.
13634,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The grating sound of each strike.
13635,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The smell of blood!
13636,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It all throws my senses into disarray...
13637,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"How can you do these things, \Nyet feel and think nothing at all?!"
13638,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Answer me!
13639,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Kill me.
13640,Condition x And x Condition.,47,This is your last chance.
13641,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I just placed a conditional \Nbond on your heart.
13642,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"If you break the rule I set, the bond will activate, crushing your heart."
13643,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Judgment Chain: \NArbiter Little Finger
13644,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The rule is that you must answer my question honestly.
13645,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Abide by that rule, and I shall \Nallow you to live a bit longer."
13646,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Where are the other spiders?!
13647,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Die, fool."
13648,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I spent too much time in that state...
13649,Condition x And x Condition.,47,It's me.
13650,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Kurapika, what's going on?"
13651,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Why didn't you call?
13652,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Are you okay?
13653,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Yeah.
13654,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I'm glad to hear that...
13655,Condition x And x Condition.,47,What about on your side?
13656,Condition x And x Condition.,47,The boss is safe. \NShe's asleep in her room.
13657,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Right, the boss' father won't arrive until late tonight, due to \Nweather complications."
13658,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I see.
13659,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I understand.
13660,Condition x And x Condition.,47,A chain user...
13661,Condition x And x Condition.,47,He's either a Manipulator or a Conjurer.
13662,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Uvogin is a dominant fighter.
13663,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"But in a one-on-one fight, he is most \Nvulnerable to those two categories."
13664,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Many Conjurers give special powers to the things that they create.
13665,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Some of those abilities could \Nrender Uvo helpless.
13666,Condition x And x Condition.,47,And a Manipulator could \Nmanipulate Uvo himself.
13667,Condition x And x Condition.,47,I should have tagged along!
13668,Condition x And x Condition.,47,Damn!
13669,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"If he fails to return by dawn, there will be a change in plans."
13670,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Shalnark senses the danger, \Nas Uvogin fails to return."
13671,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Their leader, Chrollo, prepares to terminate the chain user."
13672,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Coming up, we have Gon"

13688,Condition x And x Condition.,47,"Ooh, sounds great!"
13689,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,No good...
13690,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I've got nothing.
13691,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"That two billion reward \Nper spider is attractive, but finding them will be impossible."
13692,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Yeah...
13693,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Hey, we could ask for concrete \Ninformation on the Net."
13694,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Like about the Troupe's current location.
13695,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We could offer a large reward.
13696,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hold on...
13697,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We don't have the money for that.
13698,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It'll be fine.
13699,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Very x Sharp x Eye
13700,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Gon and his friends are \Npursuing the Phantom Troupe, and have now obtained the money to buy the information they need."
13701,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's crazy...
13702,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You actually have money.
13703,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Man, you really pawned \Nyour Hunter License?"
13704,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're insane.
13705,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"So, what should we do first?"
13706,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Let's start by purchasing \Na Southernbees catalog.
13707,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Here is this year's \NSouthernbees auction catalog.

13713,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Just as expected.
13714,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Now we wait for the \Ninformation to come in.
13715,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"First, we catch one of the spiders \Nand make them tell us where the rest are hiding, \Nso that we can bag them all!"
13716,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13717,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"What's wrong, Gon?"
13718,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,This is...
13719,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Oh, a Ben's knife."
13720,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,A Ben's knife?
13721,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"A hundred years ago, \Na mass murderer designed it."
13722,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He was a famous blacksmith.
13723,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,This is one of his original works.
13724,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's a lesser-known piece that a \Nlot of rabid collectors are after.
13725,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"So, you recognized it."
13726,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"No, I didn't."
13727,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13728,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"It happened to catch my eye, \Nso I got curious"
13729,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Gyo{\i0
13730,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's when I noticed a faint aura on it.
13731,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Gyo{\i0
13732,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nen{\i0
13733,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Basically, you look really \Nhard at something."
13734,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're right.
13735,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Let me have a look.
13736,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Nope, I don't see a thing."
13737,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Ren{\i0
13738,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Right! There's another way!
13739,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Another way?
13740,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Another way to make money.
13741,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Remember how four-eyes mentioned that
13742,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nen{\i0
13743,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Four-eyes?
13744,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wing-san.
13745,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nen{\i0
13746,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If we search for items with \Naura on them, like this knife, it's likely some genius made them."
13747,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I get it!
13748,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We can find hidden gems with no formal appraisal training.
13749,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Then we auction the items at a higher price!
13750,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you guys want that, \Nwrite down your price."
13751,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Customers are supposed to \Nname their own prices?
13752,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Yeah, that's how this market works."
13753,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"You write down what you're willing to pay, and when time expires, \Nthe highest bidder wins the item."
13754,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Understand? Popular items will see their prices shoot up.
13755,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I get it now.
13756,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Well, then let's get started."
13757,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I'll check the online forums.
13758,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Okay!
13759,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"This is a weird pot, but I detect aura..."
13760,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Someone already bid!
13761,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If a bid has already been placed, \Nenter one that's 2.5 times higher."
13762,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Even if you end up bidding too high, \Nyou'll succeed in discouraging any rivals."
13763,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,500 multiplied by 2.5...
13764,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Let's see...
13765,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's the same person!
13766,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Same on your side?
13767,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I found a couple items, but both had bids already placed by ""Zepile."""
13768,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"And after I entered a bid 2.5 times higher, he multiplied that by 4."
13769,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Then it isn't a coincidence?
13770,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,No.
13771,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What should we do?
13772,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Keep placing bids until the deadline.
13773,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"There are two of us, so we'll win some!"
13774,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Okay.
13775,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"So ultimately, we won three and lost one."
13776,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Yeah, he got that weird pot."
13777,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Well, that wasn't too bad."
13778,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Let's take these to the auction house now.
13779,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I am very sorry.
13780,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"But the auction house cannot \Naccept any additional items, once the catalog has been published."
13781,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Isn't there any way?
13782,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We really want to auction these.
13783,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I suggest that you give \Nthe trade market a try.
13784,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The trade market?
13785,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The trade market...
13786,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Professionals will be here, so if one of these \Nis genuine, we should get a great price."
13787,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I wanted to sell these at the auction, though."
13788,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,How much do you think we'll get?
13789,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Let's find out.
13790,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Oh, you found these in your cellar?"
13791,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Yep!
13792,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Dad said to sell them if the price was right.
13793,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,These are wonderful pieces.
13794,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Only fifty copies were printed, and yours has a single-digit serial number."
13795,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,And an authentic autograph.
13796,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We know.
13797,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's where the aura was coming from.
13798,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I'd guess it's worth at least 150,000."
13799,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,This antique doll is also excellent...
13800,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"It's in great shape, and the pristine condition of both \Nbox and doll raises the value."
13801,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I'm estimating 300,000."
13802,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"However, this one isn't worth much, unfortunately."
13803,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13804,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The box and statue are \Nfrom different periods.
13805,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The box was made recently.
13806,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The statue is rough and doesn't \Nadhere to any theme.
13807,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I'd say it's only worth 1,500 Jenny."
13808,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But there is a little aura...
13809,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"However, that would be its \Nappraisal as an artwork."
13810,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The wood itself is quite valuable.
13811,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,So I'll make you an offer.
13812,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you sell me the painting \Nand doll for 420,000,"
13813,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I'll buy the wood for 80,000."
13814,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"A total of 500,000?"
13815,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What do you think?
13816,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Feel free to think it over.
13817,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But I doubt anyone will quote \Nyou a better price.
13818,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"In the meantime, let me \Ncheck this wood's age."
13819,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wait!
13820,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Put down that statue.
13821,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wh-Who are you?
13822,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Don't let him scam you, kid."
13823,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"He's offering a fair price \Nfor the painting and doll, but he's lying about the statue!"
13824,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I-I never lied!
13825,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Really?
13826,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"No collector would pay \N80,000 for that wood."
13827,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're interested in the contents of that statue!
13828,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's a wooden trove.
13829,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,A wooden trove?
13830,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Three hundred years ago, these were a popular way for the \Nwealthy to hide their money."
13831,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,To hide their money...
13832,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If it's real, there should be valuables inside."
13833,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"You planned to steal the contents, \Nwhile pretending to check its age!"
13834,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I-I would never do that...
13835,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wait.
13836,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Can you prove that this is \Na genuine wooden trove?
13837,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What?
13838,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The wood is certainly over \Nthree hundred years old.
13839,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But that only tells us the material's age.
13840,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The statue itself could be modern.
13841,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"This technique is known as hoodwinking, boys."
13842,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Technique?
13843,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He's referring to a counterfeiter trying \Nto trick a professional appraiser.
13844,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But that isn't what I'm doing.
13845,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Here's a seam that an amateur would never recognize.
13846,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The seam contains an adhesive used back in that period.
13847,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're insisting this is a real wooden trove?
13848,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Yeah.
13849,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"But it is possible that it was opened \Nonce to swap out its contents, and the statue was reassembled."
13850,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We'd call that a dud.
13851,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"It's called double-dipping, placing new adhesive on top \Nof the old to create a dud."
13852,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But only an amateur would try that.
13853,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"A professional would melt \Nthe adhesive with a flame, before resealing it."
13854,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"That way, it would appear as though \Nthe statue had never been opened."
13855,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's known as welding.
13856,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It hasn't been welded.
13857,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If fire were used, the wood would be scarred \Nor the adhesive would have discolored."
13858,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Even the pros have a hard time \Nweighing those details.
13859,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I can't trust you.
13860,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I'm a pro appraiser!
13861,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I swear by my eyes...
13862,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,This is a real wooden trove!
13863,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"It's never been opened, and the treasure inside \Nhasn't been swapped out!"
13864,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Okay, let's assume that this is a \Ngenuine wooden trove."
13865,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If the contents have been swapped out, what would you do?"
13866,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I'll be your slave for the rest of my life.
13867,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Give up.
13868,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wow! Awesome!
13869,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Oh, so you're Zepile."
13870,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Thanks, Zepile-san."
13871,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You don't need to thank me.
13872,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Consider it give and take.
13873,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Twenty percent sounds fair.
13874,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13875,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,My cut when you sell the treasure.
13876,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What?
13877,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're going to rob us?!
13878,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's uncalled for.
13879,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's my fee for providing advice.
13880,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I don't see a problem.
13881,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He helped us back there.
13882,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Now, look here..."
13883,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We need to collect as much \NJenny as we possibly can.
13884,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I might be willing to buy him lunch.
13885,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Really?
13886,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Then I'll settle for that.
13887,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13888,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"So, Zepile-san..."
13889,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hmm?
13890,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I feel bad, so we'll pay you a fee."
13891,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,There you go again!
13892,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Nah, it really is okay."
13893,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"In return, just tell me something."
13894,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What tipped you off to bid on these items?
13895,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Is it okay to tell him the truth?
13896,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Well, it beats paying him."
13897,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nen{\i0
13898,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you're telling the truth, that explains why you bought the statue, not realizing something was hidden inside."
13899,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"So, why do you need money so badly?"
13900,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"We can answer that question, \Nbut not for free."
13901,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Afterwards, you have to answer our question."
13902,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Sure, that's fine."
13903,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,There's an item we want \Nto buy at the auction.
13904,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's why we need money.
13905,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Oh, which item are you interested in?"
13906,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's our turn now.
13907,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"You estimated that this treasure \Nwas worth 300 million, right?"
13908,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Could we receive that much \Nat the trade market?
13909,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,At the trade market?
13910,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,They mainly deal in hard cash...
13911,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you show up abruptly, \Nyou won't get a fair price."
13912,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What?
13913,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Seriously?
13914,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Now it's my turn.
13915,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I'll repeat the question.
13916,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Which item do you want?
13917,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Greed Island{\i0
13918,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Oh, that ridiculously expensive game?"
13919,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,How much is that weird pot \Nthat you bought worth?
13920,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh? This?
13921,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's garbage.
13922,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nothing at all.
13923,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Why do you want that expensive game?
13924,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I believe it costs 6 billion?
13925,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The asking price is 8.9 billion.
13926,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We're looking for his dad.
13927,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That game has a clue inside.
13928,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Oh...
13929,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Why did you choose that pot?
13930,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you knew the wooden trove was real, shouldn't you have bid on \Nthe more valuable item?"
13931,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But you went for the pot.
13932,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Why?
13933,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You see...
13934,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I made this pot.
13935,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13936,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But it wasn't an original creation.
13937,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It was a replica.
13938,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"In other words, a counterfeit."
13939,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"When I was destitute, \Nthis was how I made Jenny."
13940,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Once I became an appraiser \Nand began earning money,"
13941,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I quit doing that.
13942,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"When I see how poorly these are made,"
13943,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I feel mortified!
13944,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,So I browse the markets and buy them back.
13945,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,How much would a real one cost?
13946,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's my turn.
13947,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What does your dad do?
13948,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He's a pro Hunter.
13949,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,How much would a real one cost?!
13950,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Forty to fifty thousand.
13951,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Is that so? A pro Hunter, huh?"
13952,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"There are a few in the antiques world, and not one of them is ordinary."
13953,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Won't it be impossible for you \Ntwo to find him alone?
13954,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"It'll be fine. \NI'm a pro Hunter, too."
13955,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh? Seriously?
13956,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Okay, your turn to ask a question."
13957,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Okay, this is my final question."
13958,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Can I help you with anything?
13959,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13960,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"If you want to make money at an auction, \Nyou'll need an appraiser."
13961,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"You could even say that with an appraiser, you can always turn a profit."
13962,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You can set the price you want to pay me.
13963,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,How's that?
13964,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Then you have to answer our last question.
13965,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Why do you want to help us?
13966,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Because it made me happy...
13967,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It made me happy that this piece of junk actually caught your eye.
13968,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's not a piece of junk!
13969,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Nen{\i0
13970,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Everyone has some aura...
13971,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But it's incredibly difficult to harness!
13972,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You must concentrate and \Ntrain for a very long time.
13973,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I can tell how much effort you \Nput into making that pot!
13974,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You have a lot of talent!
13975,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I still think it's a weird pot, though."
13976,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,My eyes didn't deceive me.
13977,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"When you appraise objects long enough, you also become a good judge of character."
13978,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I look at the sellers and the buyers too, \Nnot just the merchandise."
13979,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's a lot harder to appraise humans than it is to appraise antiques.
13980,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"When I saw you, I knew right away..."
13981,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That I wanted to work with you.
13982,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's my answer.
13983,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What's yours?
13984,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Looking forward to it.
13985,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We'll decide your fee after \Nwe see how you do.
13986,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Okay! With that settled...
13987,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But first...
13988,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
13989,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Teach me those techniques you talked about earlier.
13990,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You're interested?
13991,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Yep!
13992,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Hoodwinking, double-dipping, welding..."
13993,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What else is there?
13994,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Seriously...
13995,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That isn't important at all!
13996,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But they sound fun! \NLike magic tricks!
13997,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We're not here to have fun!
13998,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Now I understand why this kid interests me.
13999,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He doesn't care about right or wrong.
14000,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,When I admitted to making forgeries and when that trader gave me a hard time...
14001,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,He didn't react with accusatory glares or by plotting his own evil deeds.
14002,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,His reaction was very simple.
14003,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Innocent curiosity!
14004,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"He opens his mind to everything that \Nimpresses him, right or wrong."
14005,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Which means that he's dangerous...
14006,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Someone who can never truly be appraised.
14007,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Welding is the hardest \Ntechnique to see through.
14008,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"But recently, a new technique has surfaced."
14009,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's known as exposing.
14010,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You plainly reveal the opened statue along with a fake treasure.
14011,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Because people assume that you wouldn't open the statue \Nif the treasure were fake, you can fool them."
14012,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But now this technique is getting old.
14013,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"When people started to get suspicious, \Na new technique emerged."
14014,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Can you guess what it is?
14015,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I know.
14016,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The treasure inside is also fake!
14017,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Wrong!
14018,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,I know!
14019,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Remove the treasure from a different place!
14020,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Bingo!
14021,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"You can create a new opening \Nand remove the treasure, then insert the fake \Ntreasure and seal the hole."
14022,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,This is known as side-stepping.
14023,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Side-stepping...
14024,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Many veteran appraisers have been fooled.
14025,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,They assume the statue is real if the \Nadhesive hasn't changed color from the application of fire.
14026,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,That's how they fool the pros.
14027,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You live in an incredible world.
14028,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hello?
14029,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,What? A spider?
14030,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Yeah, this looks real."
14031,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,There's a video attached.
14032,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We have two targets.
14033,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,A man and a woman.
14034,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"I'll leave now, so let's meet there."
14035,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Got it.
14036,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Let's go, Killua."
14037,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Yeah.
14038,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hey! What about the auction?
14039,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,We'll let you handle it!
14040,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Try to get us a good price!
14041,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Huh?
14042,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Okay! I've got it covered!
14043,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Gon and Killua have learned \Nabout a whole new world.
14044,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,And they are about to make \Ncontact with the Phantom Troupe.
14045,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
14046,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
14047,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
14048,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hunterpedia!
14049,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,It's Gon and Killua's
14050,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Hunterpedia!
14051,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
14052,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,"Today, we introduce Shizuku."
14053,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,A Phantom Troupe member.
14054,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,A member of the Phantom Troupe.
14055,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,She can conjure the vacuum cleaner Blinky.
14056,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Conjurer who uses a conjured \Nvacuum named Blinky.
14057,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,But it can't suck up anything alive.
14058,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Its capacity is immeasurable!
14059,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Where do you go if you're sucked in?
14060,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,No one knows.
14061,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Next Time: Pursuit x And x Analysis.
14062,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Right or left?
14063,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Right.
14064,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Do we go after the man or the woman?
14065,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,The woman.
14066,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,Should I use red or blue?
14067,Very x Sharp x Eye.,48,You can decide that for yourself!
14068,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yeah, this looks real."
14069,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,There's a video attached.
14070,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We have two targets.
14071,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,A man and a woman.
14072,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"I'll leave now, so let's meet there."
14073,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Got it.
14074,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Let's go, Killua."
14075,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yeah.
14076,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Pursuit x And x Analysis
14077,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"After a tip about the Phantom Troupe, \NGon and his friends move out."
14078,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga."
14079,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"However, the two aren't just \Nwaiting around to be caught."
14080,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Was Uvo really killed?
14081,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Probably.
14082,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Uvo was more than just a dumb brute.
14083,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I know that.
14084,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Even if he were fighting \Na difficult opponent, he had the wits and experience to prevail."
14085,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hello?
14086,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm the one who submitted the request.
14087,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You're late! Where are you?
14088,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Stop looking around...
14089,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I can see you.
14090,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's the couple behind your boyfriend?
14091,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"I'll wire the money to you now, so please confirm receipt."
14092,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,For real?
14093,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Let's go!
14094,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hurry!
14095,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,But Uvo didn't return.
14096,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Has he ever been late without informing us?
14097,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,But remember what he said?
14098,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,He wasn't coming back until he \Nsettled up with that chain user.
14099,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That's why I said probably.
14100,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I never said he was definitely dead.
14101,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Just a hunch?
14102,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Just a hunch.
14103,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, you're usually right."
14104,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Okay, we should decide our next move."
14105,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,How do we catch those two?
14106,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's impossible.
14107,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We aren't strong enough to handle them.
14108,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,What was that?
14109,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We won't know until we try!
14110,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,And why are you saying this now?!
14111,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Quiet... They'll notice us.
14112,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,But it's still true.
14113,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I knew it as soon as I saw them.
14114,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member.
14115,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Huh?
14116,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,What?
14117,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,One of the few times I've \Never heard him complain.
14118,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Said the job wasn't worth the price.
14119,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That's considered the greatest \Ncompliment a target can get.
14120,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That was when he told us to stay away from the Troupe.
14121,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"It's been a few years, so I thought we might stand a chance..."
14122,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're really that strong?
14123,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Would it help you to picture \Ntwo Hisokas sitting there?
14124,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That is definitely not something we can handle.
14125,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"So, why do you think they're here?"
14126,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Aren't they on a date?
14127,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Huh? Really?
14128,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"No, they noticed that other \Ncouple behind them."
14129,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're paying close attention \Nto their surroundings.
14130,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"At first, I thought it was just caution \Nbecause the Mafia is after them."
14131,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"But in that case, they wouldn't \Nbe sitting in a public place."
14132,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They aren't worried at all.
14133,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're waiting for someone to find them.
14134,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Acting as bait, to draw out their prey."
14135,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We're being watched.
14136,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They aren't amateurs.
14137,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yeah, I can't tell where they are, but they're focused on us."
14138,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Is it the chain user?
14139,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,No idea.
14140,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If it is, we'll follow the \Nboss' orders to go wild."
14141,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I believe the boss wishes to recruit him.
14142,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Machi...
14143,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The boss only told us to find \Nhim and bring him back.
14144,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?
14145,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Alive or dead. \NBy any means necessary.
14146,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Right?
14147,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"You're free to interpret the \Nboss' orders as you like, but you can't force me to agree."
14148,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I haven't said anything yet.
14149,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You're the one forcing the issue.
14150,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The atmosphere changed.
14151,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I've got a really bad feeling...
14152,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Did they notice us?
14153,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's okay.
14154,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They haven't noticed us yet.
14155,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Are you sure?
14156,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14157,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14158,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14159,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're trying to see if there's anyone in this area who looks or acts suspicious.
14160,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,So you'd better wipe those \Nlooks off your faces.
14161,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Act normal.
14162,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Sorry, that was a bad idea."
14163,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Let's make it clear, then."
14164,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Are we going to take him dead, or alive?"
14165,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Fine.
14166,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Heads.
14167,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Tails.
14168,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Her?
14169,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter."
14170,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Her name is Neon.
14171,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"According to the online Hunter information, the chain user is one of her bodyguards."
14172,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"As for her other bodyguards, we have pictures and names for these five."
14173,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,And this girl is responsible \Nfor Nostrade's success?
14174,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Most likely.
14175,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"This information comes \Nfrom the Hunter website, so it should be accurate."
14176,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I see...
14177,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Now I understand what happened.
14178,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It was wise to switch rooms.
14179,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The Phantom Troupe is definitely \Nusing the pro Hunter website.
14180,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If you'd moved any later, \NNeon might have been in danger."
14181,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm grateful.
14182,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Looking ahead, the first step is to get my daughter home."
14183,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Is that okay, Neon?"
14184,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, I don't have a choice."
14185,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"The auction was canceled, \Nso I don't have any reason to stay."
14186,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I really wanted to go...
14187,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They'll hold another auction next year.
14188,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Cheer up.
14189,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,And I promise I'll recover the items you wanted from those bandits.
14190,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Really?
14191,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yes, I promise."
14192,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Have I ever broken a promise?
14193,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Have you ever kept a promise?
14194,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You make a good point...
14195,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I believe your names are \NMelody and Basho?
14196,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yes...
14197,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You'll take Neon back to \Nthe house immediately.
14198,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"To be on the safe side, \Nuse simple disguises."
14199,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Okay, Neon."
14200,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Return to your room and pack.
14201,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Okay.
14202,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"All right, let's get down to our real business."
14203,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The auction will resume tonight.
14204,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The time and location haven't changed.
14205,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The community must demonstrate that they will not allow anyone \Nto intimidate them.
14206,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The Ten Dons have vowed to \Nrecover the stolen merchandise.
14207,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The stolen merchandise?
14208,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"As I told you earlier, the man we captured claimed that a Shadow Beast had taken \Neverything before they arrived."
14209,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yes, that's correct."
14210,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out.
14211,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nine bodies have been recovered so far.
14212,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"The final member, Owl, was the one carrying the merchandise."
14213,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,He was probably captured by the Troupe.
14214,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14215,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0 they wouldn't even need torture.
14216,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's believed that the merchandise Owl took has fallen into the Troupe's hands.
14217,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"So, as I was saying, with the Shadow Beasts \Ndestroyed, the Ten Dons are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe."
14218,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Professionals?
14219,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"To the Mafia, murder is a tool, not our trade."
14220,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Considering our opponents, it would be better to leave it to the experts."
14221,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"We'll have them crush the Troupe for us, \Nwhile avoiding further losses."
14222,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"However, it's also a chance to make a \Nname for ourselves in the community."
14223,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We cannot allow those hit men all the glory.
14224,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"So, Kurapika..."
14225,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I want you to join those hit men.
14226,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Take care of the chain user for me.
14227,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Got it.
14228,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're on the move. \NWhat should we do?
14229,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"As I told you, we can't \Nbeat them in a fight."
14230,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We'll find a way...
14231,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We have to.
14232,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yeah.
14233,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We can't leave empty-handed.
14234,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Okay.
14235,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Then listen carefully.
14236,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Gon and I will tail them.
14237,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We absolutely cannot let them spot us.
14238,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14239,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Wow...
14240,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"I can see him standing here, \Nbut I can't sense him."
14241,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Gon, I need you to make me two promises."
14242,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If they see us, we give up \Nimmediately and escape."
14243,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If I judge that further pursuit is impossible \Nfor any other reason, we give up."
14244,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Got it?
14245,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Uh-huh.
14246,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The signal to stop will be one phone call.
14247,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Make sure your phone's on vibrate.
14248,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If they split up, we follow the woman."
14249,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Leorio, contact Zepile, and keep an \Neye on the auction for us."
14250,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Got it.
14251,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm guessing you've never \Ntailed anyone before?
14252,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Um...
14253,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Well...
14254,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka."
14255,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Really? Without his noticing?
14256,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day."
14257,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Wow, not bad."
14258,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Ow... Why did you hit me?
14259,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Uh, it seemed appropriate."
14260,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, then you should have no problem."
14261,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Be sure to stay out of \Ntheir field of vision.
14262,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Okay, let's go."
14263,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yeah!
14264,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The targets have passed the plaza \Nand entered a side street.
14265,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Okay, confirmed."
14266,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Do they know we're here?
14267,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's okay.
14268,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14269,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"But they're on constant guard \Nagainst pursuers, so stay vigilant."
14270,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yeah.
14271,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"You, too."
14272,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?"
14273,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm the one who has to be alert to \Nany change in their movements.
14274,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's okay.
14275,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They haven't noticed us.
14276,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"When they realize we're here, \Nthey'll react in some way."
14277,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"They can try to conceal it, but their faces or behavior will betray it."
14278,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I've been put through life-or-death \Nshadowing exercises since I was three.
14279,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I won't fail and lose sight of them!
14280,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Are we being followed?
14281,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Most likely, I'd guess."
14282,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm impressed.
14283,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I can't sense a thing.
14284,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They must be quite skilled.
14285,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area."
14286,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They must realize by now that \Nthey're being followed.
14287,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Then is this a trap?
14288,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"No, they don't know our exact locations."
14289,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Or maybe they don't know they're being \Nfollowed and are heading back to base.
14290,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That would make this a huge success.
14291,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Is this a trap?
14292,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Or their hideout?
14293,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Which is it?
14294,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If it's a trap, we should run immediately."
14295,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If it's their hideout, we should continue."
14296,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're acting calm...
14297,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We continue!
14298,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Our stalker isn't taking the bait.
14299,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It probably isn't the chain user.
14300,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Why not?
14301,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I can sense multiple people tailing us.
14302,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,But the chain user works alone.
14303,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,How can you be sure?
14304,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"He's a member of the \NNostrade Family, right?"
14305,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own.
14306,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm sure because the Mafia \Nhasn't taken any action.
14307,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If the Mafia were responsible, they would use Uvo as a chip \Nagainst us, dead or alive."
14308,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Had they killed him, the news would \Nprobably be on the Net by now."
14309,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Since there's nothing, the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone, without reporting it to the Mafia."
14310,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Why would someone who works \Nfor the Mafia operate solo?
14311,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It was probably a personal grudge.
14312,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"You're using ""probably"" a lot."
14313,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Shut up.
14314,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I doubt that someone seeking \Nrevenge without Mafia backup would team up with anyone else.
14315,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Thus, the chain user is operating alone and unrelated to the group now pursuing us."
14316,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Your theory has a lot of holes.
14317,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Then what do you think?
14318,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Indeed...
14319,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I suspect that there's a link between \Nthis tail and the chain user.
14320,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You just know?
14321,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I just know.
14322,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Man...
14323,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,People who act on instinct \Nshouldn't criticize theories.
14324,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, Killua?"
14325,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're waiting for someone \Nor trying to lure us out.
14326,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,One or the other.
14327,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Do they know we're following them?
14328,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Right now, it's fifty-fifty."
14329,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,But they don't know our location.
14330,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They want to draw us out because \Nthey don't know where we are.
14331,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They're inviting us to show ourselves.
14332,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,What do we do?
14333,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They may be waiting for someone else.
14334,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hold your position and wait.
14335,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Gon, I'm hanging up."
14336,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Pay close attention.
14337,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If they give any kind of reaction, \Nwe'll run for it!"
14338,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Escape as soon as I ring the phone.
14339,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Got it?
14340,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Yeah, got it."
14341,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Phinks here.
14342,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Oh, what's up?"
14343,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I wanted to see how you were doing.
14344,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"We're being followed, \Nbut they haven't made a move."
14345,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"And we can't locate them, \Nso this will take a while."
14346,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Oh, then would you like some helpful info?"
14347,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hmm? What do you mean?
14348,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The stones were a distraction?
14349,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,This'll get him!
14350,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,He stopped me with ease...
14351,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,With one hand!
14352,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yo.
14353,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Phinks, why are you here?"
14354,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Weren't you heading out with the boss?
14355,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,This is the fourth floor.
14356,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"To fool the enemy, \Nyou first fool your allies."
14357,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The boss got me good again.
14358,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14359,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Stalking the stalkers?
14360,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?
14361,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They fooled us!
14362,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Okay, kid."
14363,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I have a few questions for you.
14364,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Boy, do you know the chain user?"
14365,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Huh?
14366,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14367,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We're looking for him.
14368,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"He asked you to follow us, right?"
14369,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I don't know who that is.
14370,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,We were following you \Nfor our own reasons.
14371,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I just need one moment...
14372,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"With an opening, I can escape!"
14373,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Well?
14374,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, indeed..."
14375,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"If he's lying, he's really good."
14376,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I can check.
14377,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Question 1... \NWhy were you following us?
14378,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Answer concisely.
14379,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Lying will only make the situation worse.
14380,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,The Mafia has put a huge \Nbounty on your heads.
14381,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Websites are offering a lot of money \Njust for information on your location.
14382,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Question 2... \NWho taught you to shadow people?
14383,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Well, mainly,"
14384,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Zetsu{\i0
14385,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'm trying to become a pro Hunter.
14386,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Who taught you how to do that?
14387,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,A Shingen-ryu master.
14388,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Question 3...
14389,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14390,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Chains?
14391,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator.
14392,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Does your master have chains \Nhanging from his right arm?
14393,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Or perhaps it's you?
14394,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I don't know.
14395,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"My master is an Enhancer, and he only taught me the \Nfour major principles."
14396,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"I see... Well, nothing we \Ncan do, if you don't know."
14397,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Time for the last question, then."
14398,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You have two choices.
14399,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Consider carefully before you answer.
14400,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Do you want to die now or later?
14401,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Make your choice.
14402,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,You have three seconds to answer.
14403,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's useless. \NDon't try anything foolish.
14404,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Yes...
14405,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Understood, we'll head over."
14406,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Boy, your friend surrendered."
14407,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I'll ask you once more.
14408,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Do you know the chain user?
14409,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,My answer is the same.
14410,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I don't.
14411,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,I see.
14412,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,How about you?
14413,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Any guesses?
14414,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Welcome to our base.
14415,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,They stand inside the \NPhantom Troupe's hideout...
14416,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,...nerves mounting to their limits.
14417,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
14418,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
14419,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
14420,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hunterpedia!
14421,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,It's Gon and Killua's
14422,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Hunterpedia!
14423,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
14424,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,"Today, we introduce Machi."
14425,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,A Phantom Troupe member.
14426,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,A Phantom Troupe member.
14427,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,She's a Transmuter.
14428,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14429,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Nen{\i0
14430,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Her special technique is Nen Stitches.
14431,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,She can put your body back together!
14432,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Like this!
14433,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Next time: Ally x And x Sword.
14434,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Snatch!
14435,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Bam!
14436,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Look! I caught it!
14437,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!
14438,Pursuit x And x Analysis.,49,Ka-boom!
14439,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Play dumb.
14440,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's right...
14441,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"He likes Gon, so he'll bail us out."
14442,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Idiot!
14443,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Oh... Oops.
14444,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What is it?
14445,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You know someone here?
14446,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ah! No...
14447,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's that girl!
14448,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Oh? You know them, Shizuku?"
14449,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Nope, never seen them before."
14450,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh?
14451,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Oh, I remember..."
14452,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's the arm wrestling kid.
14453,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Who was that?
14454,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Two days ago, you lost to \Nthat kid at arm wrestling."
14455,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Lost? I lost?
14456,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's a lie.
14457,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I would never lose to a kid.
14458,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, you were using your right hand..."
14459,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Why? I'm left-handed.
14460,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Don't bother.
14461,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Once Shizuku's forgotten something, \Nshe'll never remember."
14462,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Never mind... I was mistaken.
14463,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Thought so.
14464,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Oh?
14465,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You actually beat Shizuku?
14466,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Yeah.
14467,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Never would've imagined she \Nwas a Troupe member.
14468,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Okay, I'll challenge you."
14469,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ally x And x Sword
14470,Ally x And x Sword.,50,One more time.
14471,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ready...
14472,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Go.
14473,Ally x And x Sword.,50,One more time.
14474,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ready...
14475,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Go.
14476,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Hey...
14477,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"When it comes to arm wrestling, what's my rank among the spiders?"
14478,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Seventh or eighth?
14479,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"You're not weak, but you're \Nnot strong, either."
14480,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And the strongest was this guy called Uvogin.
14481,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"But apparently, he was \Nkilled by the chain user."
14482,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We already said we don't know who that is!
14483,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Kid!
14484,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If you speak without permission again,"
14485,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'll kill you.
14486,Ally x And x Sword.,50,One more time.
14487,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ready...
14488,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Go.
14489,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He was an Enhancer.
14490,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Simple-minded and straightforward, \Nhe loved a good, all-out fight."
14491,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But he was fussy about time.
14492,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He'd get into fights with Franklin and me when we were late.
14493,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He'd beat the crap out of me \Nin an unarmed brawl...
14494,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I've known him since before \Nthe Troupe was founded.
14495,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I know him better than anyone.
14496,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He would never...
14497,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Uvo would never lose in a fight!
14498,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He must've been caught in some dirty trap!
14499,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I will make his killer pay.
14500,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"I'll find him, no matter \Nhow many I have to kill."
14501,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The chain user bears a \Nstrong grudge against us.
14502,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The Mafia's Nostrade Family \Nhired him recently.
14503,Ally x And x Sword.,50,A grudge against the Troupe?
14504,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Recently hired...
14505,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"You might not know him directly, \Nbut you may have heard stories of him!"
14506,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Think hard...
14507,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If you have any guesses, spill them!"
14508,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I don't know anything.
14509,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"But even if I did, I would never tell you!"
14510,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"I thought you were a bunch \Nof heartless monsters, but you'll mourn the death \Nof one of your own?"
14511,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Why couldn't you spare...
14512,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Spare a fraction of that grief... for the people you've killed?!
14513,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're getting too cocky.
14514,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Gon!
14515,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Another step, and I'll cut you up."
14516,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Answer the question.
14517,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Do you know who the chain user is?
14518,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I already said I have nothing to tell you!
14519,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Feitan...
14520,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Stop.
14521,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Stop what?
14522,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Stop what you're about to do.
14523,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You know what I'm about to do?
14524,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"You're going to break his arm, right?"
14525,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'd start with a finger...
14526,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Peel off a nail.
14527,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Doesn't matter where you'd start.
14528,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Just stop!
14529,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Why are you giving me orders?
14530,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I have no reason to listen to you.
14531,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Hey, quit it, Nobunaga."
14532,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Have you forgotten the rules?
14533,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Troupe members aren't allowed \Nto start serious fights.
14534,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I know!
14535,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If there's a dispute, we flip a coin."
14536,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Tails.
14537,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Heads!
14538,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's heads.
14539,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Let him go.
14540,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"So, what do we do with them?"
14541,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They haven't told us anything \Nabout the chain user yet.
14542,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If they don't know anything, \Nwe can let them go."
14543,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, Pakunoda?"
14544,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I checked on the trip here.
14545,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They really don't know anything.
14546,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're sure?
14547,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Yes.
14548,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They have no memories of the chain user.
14549,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Seems your instinct was off this time.
14550,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's odd...
14551,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, if Pakunoda says so, it must be true."
14552,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Hey, Gon!"
14553,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Did they do anything to you \Non the way over here?
14554,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"No, they just asked me a few questions."
14555,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Thought so...
14556,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Then they learned what they wanted \Nwithout our realizing.
14557,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What was it? And how?
14558,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Sounds like they really trust \NPakunoda's judgment.
14559,Ally x And x Sword.,50,She must possess a skill more \Nconvincing than mere instinct.
14560,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They have no memories of the chain user.
14561,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Memories?
14562,Ally x And x Sword.,50,How about you?
14563,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Any guesses?
14564,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The power to scan someone's memory!
14565,Ally x And x Sword.,50,By touching them?
14566,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That would explain everything.
14567,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And we're in trouble.
14568,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"When she scanned us before, I had \Nno idea who the chain user was."
14569,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"But now, I have an image in my head."
14570,Ally x And x Sword.,50,If she checks again...
14571,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If they have nothing to do \Nwith the chain user, we can let them go?"
14572,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Yeah, there's no point \Nin keeping them here."
14573,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"No, we can't be sure they're \Ncompletely unrelated."
14574,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's possible they're being used.
14575,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If the chain user typically conceals his chains, they wouldn't realize he was the chain user."
14576,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We shouldn't release them until they \Ntell us who they're working for.
14577,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Assuming they're working for someone else, it wouldn't be the chain user."
14578,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Because he operates alone.
14579,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Then you agree with Nobunaga.
14580,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Rather than use a couple of kids, we can find the information we need \Nthrough the Nostrade Family."
14581,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Since we know the chain user's a member.
14582,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's true.
14583,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Our target is the chain user.
14584,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We should ignore everyone else.
14585,Ally x And x Sword.,50,There you go.
14586,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You kids are lucky.
14587,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"No, not yet."
14588,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I won't let him leave.
14589,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Kid...
14590,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Join the spiders.
14591,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Team up with me.
14592,Ally x And x Sword.,50,No way.
14593,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'd rather die than join you guys!
14594,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He really hates us...
14595,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"You're an Enhancer, right?"
14596,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What if I am?!
14597,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I knew it!
14598,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Hey!
14599,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We're keeping them here \Nuntil the boss gets back.
14600,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'm going to recommend we recruit them.
14601,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Are you serious?
14602,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The boss will never agree to that.
14603,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, it's your call."
14604,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But you have to watch them.
14605,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You can't blame us if they escape.
14606,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He reminds you of Uvo?
14607,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Yeah, he wears his emotions on his sleeve."
14608,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"And when he's angry, \Nhe forgets about consequences."
14609,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Most of all, he's strongest when fighting \Nfor someone else."
14610,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He did like to fight alone.
14611,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But he was strongest when he'd team up with \NNobunaga to fight a horde.
14612,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Uvo never admitted it, but he preferred having \Nsomeone to protect."
14613,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Then, he was stronger with \Nsomeone holding him back."
14614,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, I guess you could say that."
14615,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Shizuku is always so uncharitable...
14616,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"On the other hand, Nobunaga's \Nskills are superior for duels."
14617,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You could even say that they're \Nreally only effective one-on-one.
14618,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Whenever they had assignments to fight \Ntogether, they always complained."
14619,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"But in truth, they seemed to enjoy it."
14620,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Okay, that's enough reminiscing."
14621,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Let's get down to business.
14622,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Here's a list of Nostrade Family members taken from the Hunter website.
14623,Ally x And x Sword.,50,These five are particularly important.
14624,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They serve as bodyguards for \Nthe daughter of the boss.
14625,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And they're the ones who captured Uvo.
14626,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But Uvo said that the chain \Nuser wasn't on this list.
14627,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Since we don't know the \Nchain user's appearance, we'll have to find someone who does."
14628,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Oh, that's the guy I killed."
14629,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Cross out the top left guy.
14630,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Move around in pairs, and search for the people on that list."
14631,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Then we'll meet back here \Nat 10 PM. That's all.
14632,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Wait.
14633,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Nobunaga's staying here, right?"
14634,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What should I do?
14635,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You can team up with whoever's left.
14636,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Ow...
14637,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I was a fool.
14638,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If I'd made a move,"
14639,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Hisoka wouldn't have hesitated to kill me.
14640,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That murderous aura...
14641,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I was frozen in place.
14642,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If Gon had suffered a lethal blow, would I have been able to move?"
14643,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's impossible.
14644,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Your only concern when you meet someone \Nis whether you should kill them.
14645,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're wrong...
14646,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"""Never fight an enemy you can't beat."""
14647,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I drilled that into you...
14648,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're wrong!
14649,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Scary...
14650,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You look like you want to kill me.
14651,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Let me warn you first.
14652,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Step into range, and I'll cut you down."
14653,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Killua!
14654,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I stand no chance against him.
14655,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I have to think of a way to escape...
14656,Ally x And x Sword.,50,No windows.
14657,Ally x And x Sword.,50,One exit.
14658,Ally x And x Sword.,50,How can we get him to move away?
14659,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Is Leorio okay?
14660,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I hope he was able to find Zepile-san.
14661,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Killua, are you okay?"
14662,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Yeah.
14663,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Hey,"
14664,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Zepile-san taught us welding, exposing..."
14665,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What else was there?
14666,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I forgot.
14667,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Side-stomping, maybe?"
14668,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I don't think that was it...
14669,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Gon...
14670,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'll act as a decoy.
14671,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Use that chance to escape.
14672,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What are you talking about?
14673,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Seriously.
14674,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Forget it.
14675,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're smart enough to know \Nhow much stronger I am.
14676,Ally x And x Sword.,50,There won't be any chances.
14677,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I already know that!
14678,Ally x And x Sword.,50,This room only has one exit \Nand nowhere to hide.
14679,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He can see everything we're doing.
14680,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We're facing someone who can watch \Nus without creating an opening.
14681,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He's probably an iaido master.
14682,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"With his shodachi, his range \Nis at least two times mine."
14683,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If I take one step too close, \Nhe'll strike a fatal blow."
14684,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But that's the point!
14685,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You can't do it.
14686,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Shut up!
14687,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I won't know until I try!
14688,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Killua, what are you thinking?"
14689,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"I'll stop his shodachi, even if it kills me."
14690,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Use that chance to run away!
14691,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh?
14692,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What was that for?!
14693,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Don't be so selfish!
14694,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Don't talk about dying like it's nothing!
14695,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What?!
14696,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You did the same thing earlier!
14697,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'm allowed to do it!
14698,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But you aren't!
14699,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh?
14700,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You can't use logic against an Enhancer...
14701,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"We can't escape unless we're \Nprepared to die, stupid!"
14702,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You have no idea what I was thinking...
14703,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Who's the selfish one?!
14704,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Yes, I've no idea... \NBecause I'm stupid!"
14705,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You kids are hilarious!
14706,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything."
14707,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Just behave yourselves.
14708,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I know you're serious.
14709,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Don't throw your lives away.
14710,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Wait until the boss gets back.
14711,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If he won't give his approval, you can leave."
14712,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"But if you try to escape, I'll kill you."
14713,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Don't make me draw my sword.
14714,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If I pull it out, you'll die..."
14715,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I remember now!
14716,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It was side-stepping!
14717,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Welding, exposing..."
14718,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And the last one was side-stepping!
14719,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Do you remember now?
14720,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Yeah, I sure do!"
14721,Ally x And x Sword.,50,See?
14722,Ally x And x Sword.,50,How could we forget something so simple?
14723,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh?
14724,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Now that we've figured that out...
14725,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Let's go!
14726,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Are you serious?
14727,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're going to die.
14728,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'm not skilled or merciful enough to control my strength.
14729,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Fools!
14730,Ally x And x Sword.,50,If the exit is blocked...
14731,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Make your own!
14732,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The wall...
14733,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Tsk, which one do I chase?"
14734,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We're on the fifth floor.
14735,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The kid with slanted eyes \Nis already close to the stairs.
14736,Ally x And x Sword.,50,So the black-haired kid!
14737,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Now he has nowhere to run.
14738,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Am I an idiot?
14739,Ally x And x Sword.,50,They can break through walls to escape!
14740,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The slanted-eyed kid is below.
14741,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'll have to follow the black-haired one.
14742,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Where is he?
14743,Ally x And x Sword.,50,The walls are intact...
14744,Ally x And x Sword.,50,So is the door.
14745,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Killua, are you there?"
14746,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Yeah, I'm here!"
14747,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That's it!
14748,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That last hole was a decoy!
14749,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"He broke it before hiding in the nearby room, waiting for me to pass, before stepping into the hallway."
14750,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We can beat him together!
14751,Ally x And x Sword.,50,His presence disappeared...{\i0
14752,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Does the idiot want to fight me?
14753,Ally x And x Sword.,50,An advanced application of{\i0
14754,Ally x And x Sword.,50,En!
14755,Ally x And x Sword.,50,En
14756,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Normally, you shroud your body in aura that extends a few \Nmillimeters from your body."
14757,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But with{\i0
14758,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You can sense anyone who \Nsteps inside your{\i0
14759,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Inside it, you can even count \Nthe leaves as they fall."
14760,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"You can conceal your presence and approach, never making a sound."
14761,Ally x And x Sword.,50,But step within my {\i0
14762,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Come to me.
14763,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Stupid.
14764,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Man, I wanted to beat him up."
14765,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That was impossible.
14766,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He'd have fought you off and killed you.
14767,Ally x And x Sword.,50,One hundred percent guaranteed?
14768,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We don't have a chance
14769,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0
14770,Ally x And x Sword.,50,What is it?
14771,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You finally sound like yourself again.
14772,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's my job to say crazy stuff.
14773,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Your job is to stay cool and stop me.
14774,Ally x And x Sword.,50,So I'm counting on you!
14775,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You're so selfish.
14776,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Well? What do we do next?
14777,Ally x And x Sword.,50,That depends on what you want to do.
14778,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I want to defeat those guys.
14779,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Well, that matches our original objective."
14780,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0
14781,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0 we'd need to stand a chance.
14782,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And the fastest way to learn more \Nwould be to ask Kurapika.
14783,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh? Why?
14784,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Because Kurapika is the chain user \Nwho defeated one of them.
14785,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Huh?
14786,Ally x And x Sword.,50,You didn't realize it?
14787,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Is that really true?
14788,Ally x And x Sword.,50,I'm pretty confident.
14789,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"If it's true, we have a chance."
14790,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0
14791,Ally x And x Sword.,50,We need to learn the techniques appropriate to our abilities.
14792,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"And most importantly, we need the strength to fight the Troupe."
14793,Ally x And x Sword.,50,And Kurapika is the key to \Nfinding those answers?
14794,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Yeah.
14795,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"At the same time, a new storm brews at the heart of Yorknew City."
14796,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit

14798,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
14799,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Hunterpedia!
14800,Ally x And x Sword.,50,It's Gon and Killua's
14801,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Hunterpedia!
14802,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
14803,Ally x And x Sword.,50,"Today, we introduce Franklin,"
14804,Ally x And x Sword.,50,A Phantom Troupe member. a member of the Phantom Troupe.
14805,Ally x And x Sword.,50,He's an Emitter.
14806,Ally x And x Sword.,50,An Emitter.
14807,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0
14808,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Nen{\i0
14809,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Retool your fingers for an extra punch!
14810,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Next time: A x Brutal x Battlefield.
14811,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Out.
14812,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Out?
14813,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Outfield!
14814,Ally x And x Sword.,50,Infield!
14815,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Ah, this is the foundation I wanted!"
14816,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I also want this lipstick and manicure spray.
14817,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Oh, what a cute wig..."
14818,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Boss, we should get going soon."
14819,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Just a little longer.
14820,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I should buy this camisole too.
14821,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Her shopping's gonna be the death of me.
14822,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I concur.
14823,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,A x Brutal x Battlefield
14824,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Was there anything else we needed?
14825,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Did you want anything, Eliza?"
14826,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"No, nothing at all."
14827,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I have to go to the restroom.
14828,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's okay...
14829,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Watch my stuff for me.
14830,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Will Kurapika be okay?
14831,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I used my flute to help him recover a little.
14832,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,How do you feel about the \Nwhole assassins business?
14833,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The Ten Dons are hiring professionals \Nto handle the Troupe.
14834,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Professionals?
14835,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"So, Kurapika..."
14836,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I want you to join those hit men.
14837,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Judging by his heartbeat, he wasn't entirely pleased \Nabout joining the hit men."
14838,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Of course not.
14839,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"However, Kurapika is extremely determined."
14840,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"To achieve his goal, he's certainly \Nwilling to sacrifice everything."
14841,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That's a hard road...
14842,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I couldn't do it.
14843,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What's the point of a life in which \Nyou're basically killing yourself?
14844,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She's taking a long time.
14845,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Once we finish this job,"
14846,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'm using the money to see \Nthe world on my bike.
14847,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That sounds really nice.
14848,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Not enjoying yourself is a crime.
14849,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,There are many ways to spend a life.
14850,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Everyone has different ideas \Nabout what's important.
14851,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh?
14852,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What's wrong?
14853,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She's gone!
14854,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh?
14855,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What?!
14856,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Daddy's such a liar!
14857,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,He wasn't going to take me to the auction!
14858,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Fine, I'll just go by myself!"
14859,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Come in.
14860,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Forever Active
14861,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"One, two, three, four, five, six..."
14862,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Looks like everyone's here.
14863,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"No, not yet."
14864,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I thought the team only had eight members.
14865,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Nostrade is sending an additional person.
14866,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Tsk, the guy who uses that \Nvoodoo fortunetelling?"
14867,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Then, has everyone arrived?"
14868,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The job is to annihilate the Phantom Troupe.
14869,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"When the auction kicks off again, they may show up."
14870,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"If they do, dispose of them."
14871,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You're free to use any means you want.
14872,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This team will be after the same target.
14873,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We should decide how we address \Neach other when communicating.
14874,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Just use colors.
14875,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Call me Blue.
14876,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'll be Red.
14877,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's like playing a game.
14878,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Eh? What about you guys?
14879,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Silva.
14880,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'm Zeno.
14881,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Zeno? What color is that?
14882,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We will both use our real names.
14883,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What?
14884,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"You're welcome to call me by name, but I won't take orders."
14885,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We'll do this our own way.
14886,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Silva and Zeno...
14887,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Of the Zoldyck family?
14888,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Let me know if you want someone killed.
14889,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'm willing to give you a thirty percent \Ndiscount for being in the same line of work.
14890,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They're from Killua's family.
14891,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Does it really matter what we call one another?
14892,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Agreed.
14893,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,There's no requirement we work together.
14894,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,But we're talking about the Troupe.
14895,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Attacking alone will be dangerous.
14896,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,And you?
14897,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Shaky teamwork will only cause confusion.
14898,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I will move alone.
14899,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,So it's 5 to 4.
14900,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We have our answer.
14901,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The auction begins at nine. \NWe will transport you to the auction hall.
14902,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Please wait here until it's time.
14903,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Yo, Nostrade..."
14904,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,How are you feeling?
14905,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Not too bad.
14906,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Not too bad?
14907,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You've gotten pretty full of yourself.
14908,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Not too long ago, you were just \Nleading a little country gang, and now you're acting like my equal."
14909,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"I hear you've been rubbing your hands \Ntogether so much, your skin rubbed off."
14910,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You okay?
14911,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's sad when a man shows jealousy.
14912,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Bastard!
14913,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What's this about?
14914,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Go ahead and stick that knife in me!
14915,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Kurapika, that's enough!"
14916,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Let's be clear... \NNo one's impressed by you!
14917,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Many people envy my success, while they ignore their own failings."
14918,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"However, I intend to continue to rise."
14919,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,By using Neon's fortunetelling.
14920,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I expect great things from you.
14921,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You will be appropriately rewarded \Nwhen the time comes.
14922,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Yes.
14923,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The police are cooperating?
14924,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Sixty percent of the votes in the Yorknew City mayoral \Nelection were bought.
14925,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,And the police chief is the mayor's protégé.
14926,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Redirecting traffic is quite easy for us.
14927,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Hello?
14928,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Kurapika, it's terrible."
14929,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The boss ran away!
14930,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"She changed clothes in the restroom, so she must have planned ahead."
14931,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Then I can guess where she's going.
14932,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Return to the hotel and stand by.
14933,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What's wrong?
14934,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Your daughter's run away.
14935,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What?!
14936,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We probably have the same destination.
14937,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The auction?
14938,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Damn, she's turned off her phone."
14939,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,But Neon doesn't have a pass...
14940,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She'll be turned away at the gate.
14941,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This is Light Nostrade!
14942,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I need you to convey an order \Nto all the guards at the gate!
14943,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"If a girl about seventeen or \Neighteen arrives with no pass, they should take her into custody!"
14944,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Her description...
14945,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Okay, please go ahead."
14946,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Whew,"
14947,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I was stuck without a way \Nto get past that gate.
14948,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Thank you so much.
14949,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You're very welcome.
14950,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Really?! When was that?
14951,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,About five minutes ago...
14952,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Her hair and attire were slightly \Ndifferent, but it was probably her."
14953,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She didn't have a pass?
14954,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She didn't appear to realize that \Nthe auction required a pass.
14955,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"She mentioned something about \Nher daddy, but then she left."
14956,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Yes, she got in a taxi alone."
14957,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Yes, goodbye."
14958,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Nice work.
14959,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Neon, where have you gone?"
14960,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'll search for her.
14961,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Do you have a map of the city?
14962,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I've heard that you're a good fortuneteller.
14963,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh?
14964,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Someone once mentioned it to me.
14965,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I can't remember who...
14966,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'm good.
14967,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Important people request \Nmy services all the time.
14968,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What's your accuracy?
14969,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They say I'm always right.
14970,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They say?
14971,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Aren't you the one telling the fortunes?
14972,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,My hand moves on its own.
14973,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Oh, how impressive."
14974,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Would you tell me mine?
14975,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Sure.
14976,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Write your full name, date of birth, \Nand blood type on a sheet of paper."
14977,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Will this work?
14978,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Let me see.
14979,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Chrollo Lucilfer...
14980,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That's a strange name.
14981,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"My friends call me ""boss."""
14982,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What?
14983,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That's even stranger!
14984,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Then, I'll tell your fortune."
14985,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Your daughter is already in the \NCemetery Building on the auction site.
14986,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What? But how?!
14987,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Regardless, we should hurry."
14988,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Okay, all done."
14989,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,May I have a look?
14990,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Sure.
14991,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,My fortunes are a little strange.
14992,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They usually have four or five verses.
14993,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Each one corresponds to \Na week of the month, so the first may have already happened."
14994,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Oh...
14995,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The calendar loses a precious component.
14996,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The remaining months gather to mourn.
14997,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises."
14998,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Amazing.
14999,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's correct.
15000,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,About this first verse...
15001,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh?
15002,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Oh, stop..."
15003,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I never look at the fortunes I write.
15004,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Why not?
15005,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I have a feeling they're more accurate \Nif I stay away from them.
15006,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Then may I ask you a question?
15007,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Uh-huh.
15008,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This verse refers to a requiem for the dead.
15009,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Do you believe in the afterlife?
15010,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Hmm...
15011,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Not really.
15012,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,My fortunes are for people who are alive.
15013,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Like you, Chrollo-san."
15014,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"I'm guessing that the requiem is meant to help you, not the dead."
15015,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You're probably right.
15016,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Let's go.
15017,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They'll let us start browsing \Nat the auction soon.
15018,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Actually, I heard that from someone else."
15019,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Eh?
15020,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"When I was little, I saw a \Nfortuneteller on TV say that."
15021,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That fortunes were meant to \Nmake the living happy.
15022,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Really?
15023,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,So the fortuneteller tried to \Navoid giving negative fortunes.
15024,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Negative fortunes?
15025,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The idea was to encourage people to wish for and \Nwork toward better things.
15026,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"At the time, I was really moved..."
15027,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"From then on, I wanted to be a fortuneteller."
15028,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The calendar loses a precious component.
15029,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15030,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises."
15031,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The chrysanthemum withers and falls, to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes."
15032,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,But you will remain supreme.
15033,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Even after losing half your limbs.
15034,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Enjoy the interlude.
15035,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Search out new allies.
15036,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,East is the direction to go.
15037,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You will find one who awaits you.
15038,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"A few years later, that fortuneteller \Nwas arrested for being a con artist."
15039,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Are you talking about the Galactic Grandma?
15040,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Yep!
15041,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I remember that she didn't \Nbelieve in the afterlife.
15042,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Right, so that's why I don't, either."
15043,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Personally, I believe in ghosts."
15044,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh?
15045,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,And that's why I'll do as he \Nwould have wanted.
15046,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What do you mean?
15047,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Go wild.
15048,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Are you okay?
15049,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Call a doctor!
15050,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"We're on the first floor, \Nby the north elevator."
15051,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Someone's ill. Call an ambulance.
15052,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We can't.
15053,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They won't let an ambulance \Ninside without a pass.
15054,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What did you say?
15055,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What if the unthinkable happens?!
15056,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This is the daughter of the \NNostrade Family boss!
15057,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Will you take responsibility for her life?!
15058,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Tsk, got it."
15059,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She has fans among the Ten Dons.
15060,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Fine, we'll make it happen."
15061,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Hey, call for an ambulance!"
15062,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Got it.
15063,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Are you able to rewind this monitor?
15064,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Huh? Yeah.
15065,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That chop was incredibly fast...
15066,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Only I could have caught it.
15067,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's been a while since I was this excited.
15068,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,There is my prey.
15069,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Nostrade-sama, your daughter is resting in room 501, on the fifth floor."
15070,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She shouldn't have been able to secure a pass...
15071,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,How did she get in?
15072,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Your daughter's picture is on the Hunter website.
15073,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What?
15074,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Most likely, someone found \Nthis picture on the site, approached her, and then brought her here."
15075,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'll find that person and kill him!
15076,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Please remain calm.
15077,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I don't believe capturing your \Ndaughter was their objective.
15078,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,She may have been a hostage in case they \Nhad trouble infiltrating the building.
15079,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's dangerous here.
15080,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I called Melody and Basho.
15081,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,They should arrive soon.
15082,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Can I trust them?
15083,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You should go with them.
15084,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,But the auction...
15085,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,There won't be one.
15086,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This place will become a battlefield.
15087,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The auction will be postponed again.
15088,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,A trail of blood.
15089,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,He wants to be found...
15090,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,By leaving a scent that only another killer would catch.
15091,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You are just like me.
15092,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We are the same.
15093,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Addicted to murder.
15094,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Relax.
15095,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I won't use any cheap tricks.
15096,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Let's play one-on-one.
15097,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Yeah.
15098,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I have a message from the boss.
15099,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"He wants to go wild in the Cemetery \NBuilding, so we should come."
15100,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We aren't too far away.
15101,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,What about everyone else?
15102,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The rest had the same idea.
15103,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"They've been cleaning up the trash, \Nwhile approaching the building."
15104,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Okay, then let's go."
15105,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Also, the boss actually added a rule this time."
15106,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,A rule? What?
15107,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Go absolutely crazy.
15108,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The calendar loses a precious component.
15109,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15110,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises."
15111,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The chrysanthemum withers and falls, to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes."
15112,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,But you will remain supreme.
15113,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Even after losing half your limbs.
15114,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Enjoy the interlude.
15115,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Search out new allies.
15116,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,East is the direction to go.
15117,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,You will find one who awaits you.
15118,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Why?
15119,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Why?
15120,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Why am I still alive?
15121,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,This is known as an Indoor Fish.
15122,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Nen{\i0
15123,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's a carnivore that enjoys human flesh.
15124,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Its victims don't bleed or feel pain.
15125,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,And they won't die until the \NIndoor Fish disappears.
15126,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Won't die...
15127,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The calendar loses a precious component.
15128,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15129,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises."
15130,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Uvo-san, can you hear us?"
15131,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,We are playing a requiem for you.
15132,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"It was the start of a stormy night, fierce and drenched with blood,\Nyet somehow overwhelmingly sad."
15133,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
15134,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
15135,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
15136,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Hunterpedia!
15137,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's Gon and Killua's
15138,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Hunterpedia!
15139,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
15140,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Today, we introduce Phinks."
15141,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,A Phantom Troupe member.
15142,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,A member of the Phantom Troupe.
15143,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,He's an Enhancer.
15144,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,An Enhancer.
15145,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,He's strong enough to punch through a body.
15146,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"The greater the windup, \Nthe stronger his punch."
15147,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Sometimes, he dresses like an Egyptian mummy."
15148,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,It's his name.
15149,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Next time: Assault x And x Impact.
15150,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Oh, Gon..."
15151,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,Wherefore art thou Gon?!
15152,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,"Killua, that's because"
15153,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,I'm Gon!
15154,A x Brutal x Battlefield.,51,That's it?
15155,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The calendar loses a precious component.
15156,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15157,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"The mourners play a melody, while the eleventh moon quietly rises."
15158,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Assault x And x Impact
15159,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We will be making an emergency stop.
15160,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Please watch your step.
15161,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Did something happen?
15162,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We are currently evaluating the situation.
15163,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Beats me.
15164,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's me.
15165,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Are they here?
15166,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Yeah, it's gotta be them!"
15167,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're the only ones strong enough to fight a whole crowd alone!
15168,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hey... Hey!
15169,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Damn!
15170,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Figure out how many enemies we're up against!
15171,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Listen up! Do whatever \Nit takes to stop them!
15172,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Do not let them near this building!
15173,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're late...
15174,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Our escort isn't here yet?
15175,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Their names are Melody and Basho.
15176,Assault x And x Impact.,52,All traffic in Yorknew City has been stopped.
15177,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're probably stuck.
15178,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's dangerous for Neon to be here!
15179,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Isn't there any way to evacuate her?
15180,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The ambulance we requested is on its way.
15181,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Please wait a little longer.
15182,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Ambulance?
15183,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Yes, that's right."
15184,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Something's wrong here.
15185,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The man who entered \Nthe building with Neon and then called for a doctor...
15186,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Boss.
15187,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Kurapika, don't take one step away from my daughter until the ambulance arrives."
15188,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Got it?
15189,Assault x And x Impact.,52,But my assignment is to kill \Nthe Phantom Troupe.
15190,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"At the time, I thought that \NNeon would already be home."
15191,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"But instead, she's unconscious here, exposed to the Troupe."
15192,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I absolutely must ensure Neon's safety.
15193,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Stay here for the time being.
15194,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'm begging you.
15195,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Understood.
15196,Assault x And x Impact.,52,What a pity...
15197,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They aren't putting up much of a fight.
15198,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Well, I guess it was stupid to expect more—"
15199,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Damn...
15200,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"They're crazier than I've heard, launching a frontal attack with ten people."
15201,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Man...
15202,Assault x And x Impact.,52,When did this place turn into a battlefield?
15203,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Where is the patient?
15204,Assault x And x Impact.,52,There's nothing to prove that you \Naren't a Phantom Troupe member.
15205,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"One funny move, and I'll blow your head off."
15206,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Follow me.
15207,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Please allow me to check you all.
15208,Assault x And x Impact.,52,What's that?
15209,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Bastard...
15210,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Currently, all trains have been stopped."
15211,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"For your safety, please wait patiently."
15212,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'm not getting any reception down here.
15213,Assault x And x Impact.,52,And we don't know when the \Ntrains will start moving again.
15214,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That settles it... We'll have to run.
15215,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"You were hired to be an assassin, so stop hiding in this room, and go fight."
15216,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Or did you get scared once \Nthe Troupe showed up?
15217,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Oh, actually..."
15218,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I requested that Kurapika stay here.
15219,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"I understand that he's been \Nhired by the Ten Dons, but I was worried about my daughter."
15220,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I don't intend to sell you out.
15221,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"But you're being paid well, so I expect you to do your job."
15222,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I agree that I must do something.
15223,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I could at least patrol this building.
15224,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Yes, I suppose."
15225,Assault x And x Impact.,52,But you must come immediately if I call.
15226,Assault x And x Impact.,52,My daughter's safety comes first.
15227,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Understood.
15228,Assault x And x Impact.,52,How long do we have to wait?
15229,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Hey, what's going on outside?"
15230,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I can hear explosions nearby!
15231,Assault x And x Impact.,52,When will the auction start?
15232,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Explain what's going on.
15233,Assault x And x Impact.,52,P-Please wait a little longer.
15234,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Tell us whether the auction's still on or not!
15235,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Everyone here is a gang leader or a big shot.
15236,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're endangering themselves to prove that they aren't afraid of the Troupe.
15237,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Return my phone!
15238,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I've no idea what's happening outside.
15239,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"I need my weapons, too!"
15240,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"As you already know, weapons are banned."
15241,Assault x And x Impact.,52,What if they get inside?
15242,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Are we supposed to fight with our bare hands?!
15243,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's becoming chaotic here...
15244,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The auctioneers and handlers will lose control of the situation very soon.
15245,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hello?
15246,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Oh, Kurapika?"
15247,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Huh?
15248,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Whew, we finally got a hold of you."
15249,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Is this Gon?!
15250,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Yep, can you talk right now?"
15251,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Uh, sorry, I'm in the middle of something."
15252,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'll call you back.
15253,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Wait!
15254,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Can you give me one minute?
15255,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I have something to tell you.
15256,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Killua and I ran into the Troupe.
15257,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Actually, they caught us."
15258,Assault x And x Impact.,52,What were you guys thinking?!
15259,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Do you realize how dangerous they are?
15260,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Let me talk.
15261,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"I thought I knew, but after we met \Nthem, it became painfully clear."
15262,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're strong.
15263,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Right now, we have no chance against them."
15264,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That's why we need your assistance.
15265,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We want to help.
15266,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That's ridiculous.
15267,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I won't help you get yourselves killed.
15268,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Don't you want to know where their base is?
15269,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I have my own sources of information.
15270,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Do you know all of their powers?
15271,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Enough! Just stay away from the Troupe!
15272,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"You're the chain user who killed \None of their members, right?"
15273,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're looking everywhere for you.
15274,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"If you won't treat us as friends or equals, we'll do whatever we must to help!"
15275,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Kurapika...
15276,Assault x And x Impact.,52,One of their members cried in front of us.
15277,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He said that he couldn't forgive \Nwhoever killed his friend.
15278,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I got really mad after seeing that.
15279,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I couldn't let that go.
15280,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We want to stop them!
15281,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Please, Kurapika..."
15282,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'll call you back.
15283,Assault x And x Impact.,52,If you won't treat us as friends or equals...
15284,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We want to stop them!
15285,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Here they come!
15286,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Don't let them escape!
15287,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I can feel the heat!
15288,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Someone's coming!
15289,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Does he have a gun?
15290,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Who's stationed here?
15291,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I-It's no use.
15292,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They're too strong.
15293,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We don't stand a chance...
15294,Assault x And x Impact.,52,How strong are they?!
15295,Assault x And x Impact.,52,This strong!
15296,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Damn it!
15297,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Aw, he broke."
15298,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I need to find my next machine.
15299,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Are you okay?
15300,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I found the corpse of one of the assassins!
15301,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Someone's already inside the building!
15302,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Damn it.
15303,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's hopeless!
15304,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Hey, don't run away!"
15305,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Fight!
15306,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Man, what's going on?"
15307,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's me.
15308,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Where's our backup?
15309,Assault x And x Impact.,52,What are you doing?
15310,Assault x And x Impact.,52,They should be there any moment.
15311,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We'll be arriving shortly...
15312,Assault x And x Impact.,52,You can't mean...
15313,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The two thousand men that were \Nsupposed to assemble here have all been wiped out?
15314,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Now what?
15315,Assault x And x Impact.,52,There are Troupe members inside the building.
15316,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"It's me, Bean!"
15317,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Get the Ten Dons on the line.
15318,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's urgent!
15319,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The intruder must be a member of the Troupe.
15320,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Their objective is to steal the rest of the \Nmerchandise and avenge their comrade.
15321,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He said that he couldn't forgive \Nwhoever killed his friend.
15322,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That's what I wanted!
15323,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hey! Enough already!
15324,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Give us the weapons we handed over!
15325,Assault x And x Impact.,52,But the rules state that...
15326,Assault x And x Impact.,52,To hell with the rules!
15327,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Do you understand our situation?!
15328,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I know you've got professional assassins wandering around this place!
15329,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"If you're gonna depend on those freaks, you might as well let us fight!"
15330,Assault x And x Impact.,52,My name is Zeno Zoldyck.
15331,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The famous Zoldyck family of assassins!
15332,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The Ten Dons called in these monsters?
15333,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"At the moment, one bandit has \Ninfiltrated this building."
15334,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He has killed a number of the assassins that your people hired.
15335,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Even if you were fully armed, it would take me seven seconds \Nto kill the lot of you."
15336,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The enemy is capable of a similar feat.
15337,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"If you understand, shut up and wait."
15338,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's a different story if you want to die...
15339,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Well?
15340,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A single strike from behind.
15341,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Beautiful.
15342,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"His presence was only exposed \Nfor a brief instant, and barely any trace remains."
15343,Assault x And x Impact.,52,En{\i0
15344,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's an exhausting technique.
15345,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Let's start from the roof and head down...
15346,Assault x And x Impact.,52,This building's radius is one hundred meters.
15347,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Will you be okay, old man?"
15348,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Fool, if I wanted, I could \Nhandle three times that."
15349,Assault x And x Impact.,52,This job is hardly worth the pay...
15350,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"You're late, Kurapika!"
15351,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hurry back right now.
15352,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Stay at Neon's side!
15353,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Right, I'm on my way."
15354,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Damn!
15355,Assault x And x Impact.,52,We meet again.
15356,Assault x And x Impact.,52,You remember me?
15357,Assault x And x Impact.,52,How could I forget?
15358,Assault x And x Impact.,52,You killed one of my people.
15359,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It was difficult.
15360,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Careful, old man."
15361,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He can steal your techniques.
15362,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"This could be hard, fighting one on two."
15363,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It takes a quality knife to scratch me.
15364,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Looks to be a mid-era Ben's knife.
15365,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That shape...
15366,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's poisoned?
15367,Assault x And x Impact.,52,You okay?
15368,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'm just fine.
15369,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Just fine?
15370,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A tenth of a milligram will \Ncompletely paralyze a whale.
15371,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Nen{\i0
15372,Assault x And x Impact.,52,You must be a Specialist.
15373,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I would consider you a threat if you \Ncould freely use the powers you steal.
15374,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"However, you must take risks \Nto take those abilities."
15375,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A technique that strong must \Nhave its drawbacks...
15376,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I would guess you must clear four or five conditions \Nbefore you can steal an ability.
15377,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Correct.
15378,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The old man's a difficult opponent.
15379,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It will be difficult to clear those \Nconditions while you fight us.
15380,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Meaning that you won't be able to steal our abilities while we fight.
15381,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Proven by your need to use a \Npoisoned knife as a deterrent.
15382,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Correct again.
15383,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I have no choice.
15384,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Silva, I'll need your support."
15385,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Once I lock him in place, kill him, even if you have \Nto kill me with him."
15386,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Understood.
15387,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He focused his aura into his hand.
15388,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He has incredible potential.
15389,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I won't be able to block that attack.
15390,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Skill Hunter: \NBandit's Secret
15391,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A mantle... \NA Conjurer ability?
15392,Assault x And x Impact.,52,This could be difficult...
15393,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Even if it's a stolen ability, \NI can't attack recklessly without knowing what it's capable of."
15394,Assault x And x Impact.,52,That would be an ordinary fighter's reaction...
15395,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Dragon Head: Long-Tou Xi-Hua
15396,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Dragon Lance
15397,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I see now...
15398,Assault x And x Impact.,52,His power is to seal other people's abilities in that Conjured book letting him use them freely.
15399,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"In return, when he uses another ability, he must hold that book \Nin his hands at all times."
15400,Assault x And x Impact.,52,The mantle is also a Conjured item.
15401,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"He has shown no signs of taking the offensive, but he's trying to close the gap between us."
15402,Assault x And x Impact.,52,So it's a defensive tool that can be used to close the distance and counterattack.
15403,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Which means I have no reason \Nnot to fight from a distance.
15404,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Then I wait for my chance, and grab it."
15405,Assault x And x Impact.,52,This old man is incredible.
15406,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He managed to read my mind in a flash.
15407,Assault x And x Impact.,52,I'm guessing I can't capture him alive.
15408,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"When he shuts the book, the ability he withdrew also vanishes?"
15409,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"In any case, he's quite talented."
15410,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"He dodges each of my old man's \Nattacks at the last second, leaving me no opening to attack."
15411,Assault x And x Impact.,52,He's physically stronger than before.
15412,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Since we don't know what abilities he has, we can't finish him off without being willing to risk our lives."
15413,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Now! Kill him!
15414,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A thundering boom resounded \Nthrough Yorknew City.
15415,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Kurapika had no idea that the shock wave would lead to an unexpected development.
15416,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
15417,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
15418,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
15419,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hunterpedia!
15420,Assault x And x Impact.,52,It's Gon and Killua's
15421,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Hunterpedia!
15422,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
15423,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"Today, we introduce Shalnark."
15424,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A Phantom Troupe member.
15425,Assault x And x Impact.,52,A Phantom Troupe member.
15426,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"He's smart, knowledgeable, and calculating."
15427,Assault x And x Impact.,52,"With his sharp mind,"
15428,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Nen{\i0 he's tasked with gathering \Ninformation and data analysis. letting him control them with his cell phone.
15429,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Black Voice!
15430,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Next time: Fake x And x Psyche!
15431,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Kopitor?
15432,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Kotorpi?
15433,Assault x And x Impact.,52,Kortopi!
15434,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Now! Kill him!
15435,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Fake x And x Psyche
15436,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Hey, what's going on?!"
15437,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Below us!
15438,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,There was a huge explosion below us.
15439,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Enough waiting around...
15440,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'll see what's happening for myself!
15441,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Everyone, please calm down."
15442,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I finally managed to contact the Ten Dons.
15443,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,They wish to speak to you directly.
15444,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"The auction will proceed, \Nso please remain calm."
15445,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Please enter the auction hall \Non the tenth floor.
15446,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,An underground chamber where everything costs extra.\NThat is where you will sleep. \NNever descend stairs that you didn't first ascend. \NDo not compete with others at numbers.
15447,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'll be fine.
15448,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,This is the tenth floor.
15449,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'll be safe as long as I don't \Ngo down any stairs...
15450,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,It's all good.
15451,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Her fortunes are one hundred \Npercent accurate.
15452,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Her fortunes won't come true \Nif you heed the warning.
15453,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,So I'm okay...
15454,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Yo, everyone all right?"
15455,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"First, I apologize for taking \Nso long to make contact."
15456,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Sorry.
15457,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"There's been a lot of chaos, but it's all cleared up now."
15458,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We've dealt with the Phantom Troupe's leader.
15459,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,It's only a matter of time before \Nthe rest of them are finished.
15460,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We're letting the professionals \Nhandle the hunt so you can enjoy the auction.
15461,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Tonight, we'll be watching the auction live, so let us see some furious bidding."
15462,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"As you all just heard, the Ten Dons will be watching a \Nlive feed of the proceedings."
15463,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Please concentrate on the auction.
15464,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Illumi?
15465,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yeah.
15466,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Where is my client?
15467,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Right here.
15468,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Oh, were you fighting?"
15469,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Is he still alive?
15470,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Just in the nick of time...
15471,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,That's a relief.
15472,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Well, relay a message."
15473,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I've killed the Ten Dons.
15474,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Tell him to wire the money \Nto my account as agreed.
15475,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Up we go...
15476,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Good grief.
15477,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,It seems we both get to live another day.
15478,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Aren't you supposed to kill me?
15479,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We were hired by the Ten Dons.
15480,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Now that they're all dead, you are no longer our target."
15481,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Really? That's surprising.
15482,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,You won't get another chance like this.
15483,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Do you believe that we kill for pleasure?
15484,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We don't do this for fun.
15485,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I refuse to work for nothing \Nor die for nothing.
15486,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Did you know that I hired Illumi \Nto assassinate the Ten Dons?
15487,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Of course.
15488,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,But that's irrelevant.
15489,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We simply do the job we're hired for.
15490,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I see.
15491,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Say, can I ask you something?"
15492,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"If you and I were to fight one-on-one, who would win?"
15493,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Most likely, I would win."
15494,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Unless you decided to actually try to kill me.
15495,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Honestly, you're a cheeky kid."
15496,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,So he could tell?
15497,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,What a drag...
15498,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I couldn't steal their powers.
15499,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,So you want us to wait at L Hospital?
15500,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Yeah, it's more dangerous \Nhere than anticipated."
15501,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We'll send her over by ambulance.
15502,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"She's just unconscious, \Nso you shouldn't have to worry."
15503,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,But she'll be much safer at a hospital.
15504,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Make the preparations.
15505,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Looks like you had fun, boss..."
15506,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yeah.
15507,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'm a little tired now.
15508,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,You were up against the Zoldyck family.
15509,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I wish I could've seen how \Nthose two fought you.
15510,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Fighting would be more fun than watching.
15511,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Kortopi, everything ready?"
15512,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Of course.
15513,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"I can't make living copies, but I can provide static copies."
15514,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Good enough.
15515,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Then we'll stick to the plan.
15516,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Also...
15517,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Don't touch the ambulance that girl is in.
15518,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Will we really be safe on the trip over?
15519,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"If they planned to attack the ambulance, \Nthey would've done so on its way here."
15520,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,And you shouldn't have to worry \Nabout stray bullets anymore.
15521,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,It's the moment you've all been waiting for.

15655,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I don't care who I kill right now...
15656,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Even if it's you.
15657,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Who is that guy?
15658,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Yeah, I'm getting into this!"
15659,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,How about another?
15660,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Seriously...
15661,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,They were drinking while \Nwe were captured?

15667,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,What's your point?
15668,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"In my country, you can drink \Nonce you're sixteen."
15669,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I see.
15670,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Really...
15671,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I had no idea that happened.
15672,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'm amazed you escaped alive.
15673,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,The Phantom Troupe's that dangerous?
15674,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Back there, one of the tricks \Nyou taught us came in handy."
15675,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,If the exit is blocked...
15676,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Make your own!
15677,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I get it.
15678,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'm glad I was able to help in some way.
15679,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Experience can sometimes blind you.
15680,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,A con artist's knowledge might come \Nin handy against the Troupe.
15681,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Exactly!
15682,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,There's more to being a con \Nartist than you'd think.
15683,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I haven't just been drinking \Nmyself senseless here...
15684,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I've been learning a lot from Zepile.
15685,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"And tomorrow morning, \Nwe'll hit the auction."
15686,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"You guys are coming, right?"
15687,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Nen{\i0
15688,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Kurapika? You got through to him?
15689,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Yep, but we're waiting for \Nhim to call us back."
15690,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Hold on.
15691,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Nen{\i0
15692,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I did.
15693,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Why?
15694,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Nen{\i0
15695,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,But Kurapika managed to defeat a \Nmember of the Phantom Troupe.
15696,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Seriously?
15697,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yeah.
15698,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Nen{\i0
15699,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Some strength that doesn't \Nrequire experience or power.
15700,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yay!
15701,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Thanks, Daddy!"
15702,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,They're beautiful...
15703,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Are you feeling better now?
15704,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Uh-huh, I forgive you!"
15705,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Really?
15706,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'm glad to hear that.
15707,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Good work.
15708,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"My daughter is doing well, so we'll head back to the hotel."
15709,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Tomorrow, we need to buy \Nthe actor's used tissue."
15710,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,And that will end the auction.
15711,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'll be leaving the morning of \Nthe day after tomorrow.
15712,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,But I want you to accompany \Nmy daughter as she shops.
15713,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Kurapika...
15714,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We can handle the remainder \Nof the auction and shopping.
15715,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,You should get some rest.
15716,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yes...
15717,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Thanks, I think I'll do that."
15718,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Is he really okay?
15719,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Hello? Kurapika?
15720,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Yeah.
15721,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"You said you wanted to \Nstop the Troupe, right?"
15722,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,That won't be necessary now.
15723,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,The spider is dead.
15724,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Huh? What do you mean?
15725,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Kurapika?!
15726,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Oh, a shame."
15727,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I'd hoped to provide some comfort.
15728,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,The Mafia community was nothing special.
15729,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,We didn't even need Nobunaga.
15730,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Shut up!
15731,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,What'd he say?
15732,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,The Troupe's dead.
15733,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,What?!
15734,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Seriously?
15735,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,He hung up.
15736,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I have no way to find out any more.
15737,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Kurapika is now drowning in \Nan indescribable emptiness.

15751,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,I might be a fake.
15752,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,What?
15753,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Note: He can't conjure living copies.
15754,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Next time: Fortunes x Aren't x Right?
15755,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,My horoscope was horrible today.
15756,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,"Oh, there's a Choco Robo here."
15757,Fake x And x Psyche!,53,Lucky! So much for that horoscope!
15758,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?

15770,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I was getting revenge!
15771,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But I didn't do it on purpose.
15772,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You did it deliberately!
15773,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why are you so upset?
15774,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We sold that piece for 355 million Jenny!
15775,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It could have sold for more...
15776,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We got a decent price!
15777,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"No, we could have gotten over 400 \Nmillion if we'd sold at a different time."
15778,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We had bad luck...
15779,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You sure take this seriously.
15780,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It isn't like you would've gotten anything \Nif we'd gotten a better price.
15781,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That's not the issue here.
15782,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If we run with the money, \Nwe'd each get a 170 million cut!"
15783,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Are you really friends with Gon and Killua?
15784,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I was joking.
15785,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hello?
15786,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Oh, Kurapika!"
15787,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It's been a while since we \Nwere all together last!
15788,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.
15789,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Where's Zepile-san?
15790,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,He wanted to validate our check and find more hidden gems to sell.
15791,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Anyway...
15792,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What?
15793,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You've got this intensity about you...
15794,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You seem a little more intimidating now.
15795,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Really?
15796,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You don't seem to have changed much.
15797,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"And you're more annoying, too!"
15798,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Oh, I heard that you defeated \Na member of the Troupe."

15800,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If you're looking for advice \Non catching the spiders, then stop."
15801,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That's not the only reason.
15802,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Nen{\i0
15803,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Nen{\i0
15804,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Then you don't want my advice.
15805,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It won't do you any good.
15806,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why not?
15807,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,My power can only be \Nused against the Troupe.
15808,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Huh?
15809,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Restraint and vow?
15810,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.

15812,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The stronger your resolve, \Nthe more power you receive."
15813,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"However, you also incur a \Nbig risk at the same time."
15814,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Nen{\i0
15815,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I vowed to use it against the spiders alone.
15816,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I established a rule for myself.
15817,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What's the rule?
15818,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If I use my chains on one who isn't a spider,"
15819,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I will forfeit my life.
15820,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Huh? What do you mean?
15821,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Nen{\i0
15822,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If I break the rule, that blade will pierce my heart, killing me."
15823,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,This is the rule that shows my resolve.
15824,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Restraint and vow.
15825,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,My power is the product of pure hatred.
15826,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It only works on the spiders.
15827,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I'm telling you because I trust you.
15828,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Don't tell anyone else.
15829,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why...
15830,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why would you tell us something so important?!
15831,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I'm not sure.
15832,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"With their leader's death, \NI must have relaxed."
15833,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It'll be fine if we keep our mouths shut.
15834,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It's too dangerous.
15835,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,One of the surviving members can read minds.
15836,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If they find out, Kurapika won't \Nbe able to beat them!"
15837,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But she didn't learn anything last time.
15838,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That's because we didn't know \NKurapika was the chain user.
15839,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Then we just have to stay away from them.
15840,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"They've already checked you, \Nso they think you're clean."
15841,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But there's also a guy called Nobunaga.
15842,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,He's especially dangerous.
15843,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"He's looking for Kurapika, and he's still trying to chase us down."
15844,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Is he aware that you guys know Kurapika?
15845,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,No...
15846,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Then it's okay!
15847,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"As long as no one around the mind reader knows Kurapika, then you're safe."
15848,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Well, I've also been in \Ncontact with Hisoka."
15849,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What?!
15850,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hisoka?
15851,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,He knows that I am the chain user.
15852,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"We made a pact, but his target, the leader of \Nthe spiders, is now dead."
15853,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,So I don't know what he'll do.
15854,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What do you mean?
15855,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We're leaving?
15856,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I mean exactly what I say.
15857,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We're departing tonight.
15858,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We'll take the rest of the treasure tonight.
15859,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That will be the end.
15860,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It isn't.
15861,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What else is there?
15862,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We have to find the chain user.
15863,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You seem obsessed.
15864,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yes, I am."
15865,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We're going to scatter \Nwithout avenging Uvo?
15866,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Uvo will be bored in the next \Nworld if we don't send the chain user to join him.
15867,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Cut it out, Nobunaga."
15868,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The boss has issued an order.
15869,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yeah, and an order from \Nthe boss is absolute."
15870,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"But is that really an order from our boss,"
15871,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Chrollo?
15872,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Nobunaga, watch yourself..."
15873,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Shut up!
15874,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I'm talking to Chrollo!
15875,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Before I can answer your question...
15876,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Nobunaga,"
15877,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I need you to answer my question.
15878,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Nobunaga,"
15879,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I need you to answer my question.
15880,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What's your date of birth?
15881,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Huh?
15882,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What day were you born?
15883,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"September 8th, 70."
15884,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Blood type?
15885,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,B.
15886,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Name?
15887,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Nobunaga Hazama...
15888,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You already know that!
15889,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The hell is this about?!
15890,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What do you want next?
15891,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"No, that's enough."
15892,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Write all of that on this sheet of paper.
15893,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why didn't you tell me to \Ndo that in the first place?
15894,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Huh? What's this?
15895,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,A one hundred percent accurate \Nfortune written in verse.
15896,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The ability to see the future.
15897,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I stole this power from Nostrade's daughter.
15898,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,One hundred percent accurate?
15899,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Each of the four verses predicts \Nwhat will happen in that week.
15900,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The calendar loses a precious component.
15901,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15902,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The first moon, having missed his opportunity, continues to pursue the eleventh moon alone."
15903,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The chrysanthemum withers and falls, to lie on the ground beside bloody Scarlet Eyes."
15904,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But the spider does not stop.
15905,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Even after losing half its limbs.
15906,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,This is the fortune his \Ndaughter gave me yesterday.
15907,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Is the precious component of the calendar...
15908,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Uvo.
15909,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That girl didn't know anything about Uvo.
15910,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"In other words, she predicted our attack on the Mafia auction."
15911,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,And there were fans of her \Nfortunetelling among the Ten Dons.
15912,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I get it.
15913,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That explains why the merchandise had already been moved the \Nfirst time we attacked.
15914,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What does Nobunaga's fortune say?
15915,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The pen writes by itself.
15916,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I don't know what was written.
15917,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Ask Nobunaga.
15918,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Well, Nobunaga?"
15919,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Next week, five of us will probably die."
15920,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Which five?
15921,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,No idea...
15922,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I can't interpret this.
15923,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I kind of understand the second verse.
15924,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The spider loses half its limbs.
15925,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The spider would be us?
15926,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.
15927,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"And the limbs would be the members, so half would be six."
15928,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That means five more after losing Uvo.
15929,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The same line was in my fortune.
15930,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Let me see.
15931,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Boss, can you tell my fortune?"
15932,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The calendar loses a precious component.
15933,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The remaining months gather to mourn.
15934,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"You join your ally as an offering, to keep him from being lonely."
15935,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You will find eternal rest in a room filled with black merchandise.
15936,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Beware solitude above all.
15937,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You have the most to fear when \Nyou are alone with another.
15938,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I thought so.
15939,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I'm going to die next week.
15940,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Seriously?
15941,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yep.
15942,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Because I only got two verses.
15943,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"And Pakunoda and Shalnark will die, as well."
15944,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,How do you know that?
15945,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It seems the numbered months \Nhere refer to Troupe members.
15946,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,November is the eleventh month.
15947,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Uvo was member #11.
15948,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Exactly.
15949,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The chrysanthemum is the \Nflower of September.
15950,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"It blooms in August, the eighth month, and it withers in June."
15951,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"This refers to members #6, #8, and #9."
15952,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"And since the word ""falling"" \Nis used, it implies death."
15953,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"I'm not certain to whom ""Scarlet Eyes"" refers."
15954,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It isn't one of us.
15955,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I'm guessing it's the chain user.
15956,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Scarlet Eyes...
15957,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I remember now.
15958,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The clan whose eyes turned red.
15959,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Then there was a survivor?
15960,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,So it seems...
15961,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Will he also die?
15962,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hard to say.
15963,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It could just mean that he's covered in blood.
15964,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Nobunaga, this means we'll \Nsuffer serious casualties if we fight the chain user!"
15965,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We'll lose half our members.
15966,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"You and I have abilities that \Ncan be easily replaced, but Shizuku and Pakunoda have rare powers."
15967,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The Troupe can't afford to lose them.
15968,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Today is Saturday of the first week.
15969,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If we return home today, we won't run into the chain user next week."
15970,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The advantage of being able \Nto predict the future is that we can avoid undesirable prophecies.
15971,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If we leave this place without \Nfighting the chain user, this fortune is one hundred percent \Ncertain to not come true."
15972,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Nobunaga, you and Uvo were \Nthe Troupe's attackers."
15973,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,To die is just part of your job.
15974,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I believe that you both chose \Nthat role voluntarily.
15975,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yeah, that's right..."
15976,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Shizuku, Paku, and Shal collect intelligence."
15977,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,They provide our support.
15978,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You could say they're our lifeline.
15979,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Isn't it your job to serve as their shield?
15980,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yeah, it is!"
15981,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Wait...
15982,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You should tell some of the \Nother members' fortunes.
15983,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Perhaps we could gather additional \Nclues for avoiding the prophecy.
15984,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What do we do?
15985,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Now that we know Kurapika's secret, it's dangerous to wait around."
15986,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If Nobunaga captures either Gon or me again, we probably won't be able to escape."
15987,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But we have Kurapika with us now.
15988,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We should take them out before they have a chance \Nto recover and escape.
15989,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We know where their current base is.
15990,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"If we take too long, they might get away."
15991,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We need to move fast.
15992,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,They could be making an \Nescape as we speak.
15993,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We don't have time for too much thought.
15994,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The woman you mentioned \Nis certainly a threat...
15995,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"But since their leader is dead,"
15996,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"I'll do as Gon says, and focus on \Nrecovering my brethren's eyes."
15997,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Seriously?!
15998,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.
15999,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You're sure about this?
16000,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Kurapika's made up his mind.
16001,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We can't force him to change it.
16002,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Sorry, Killua."
16003,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Thank you for the valuable information.
16004,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It's from Hisoka...
16005,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The dead bodies were fakes.
16006,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Kurapika?
16007,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The dead bodies were fakes...
16008,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Huh?
16009,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You mean the dead bodies \Nof the Troupe members?
16010,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yeah, the dead spiders were fakes!"
16011,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It would be possible for a \NConjurer to accomplish that.
16012,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Damn!
16013,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Why didn't I realize this sooner?
16014,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The situation's changed.
16015,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What now?
16016,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We're here to help.
16017,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Uh-huh.
16018,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.
16019,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hello?
16020,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Kurapika, it's me."
16021,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Melody?
16022,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What is it?
16023,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The community has called off the hunt \Nfor the remaining Troupe members.
16024,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What?
16025,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,We've learned that they \Ncame from Meteor City.
16026,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The Troupe comes from Meteor City?
16027,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The Ten Dons gave the order directly.
16028,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The reward has been rescinded.
16029,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The reward has been rescinded?
16030,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Seriously?
16031,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The Troupe comes from Meteor City.
16032,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Makes sense...
16033,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"That explains why their \Nidentities are still unknown, and why the cops haven't \Nbeen able to catch them."
16034,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What's Meteor City?
16035,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"A city populated by people who, \Nas far as society is concerned, don't exist."
16036,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,There's a city like that?
16037,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Yeah.
16038,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Officially, it's unpopulated, but it's said that ten million people live there."
16039,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"It began as a dump over 1,500 years ago."
16040,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,People began to live off the garbage that was dumped there.
16041,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You're allowed to dump anything there.
16042,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"From garbage to weapons, and even people."
16043,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,And the residents will accept anything left there.
16044,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"I've heard that Meteor City \Nresidents share a bond thinner than that between strangers, \Nstronger than that between family."
16045,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Actually, there are those \Nwho provide Meteor City with weapons and precious metals \Nunder the pretext of garbage."
16046,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,That would be the Mafia community.
16047,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What do you mean?
16048,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But the Mafia is hunting the Troupe!
16049,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"In return, the Mafia recruited \Npeople from Meteor City."
16050,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"People who didn't exist, as far \Nas society was concerned."
16051,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Perfect for committing crimes.
16052,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The Troupe destroyed the \Nnormally intimate relationship between the Mafia community and Meteor City.
16053,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,But the Mafia has decided to \Nprioritize that relationship.
16054,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, half angel, half death-bringer."
16055,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,You would do well to sell \Nthe calendar's secrets.
16056,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,He will be especially pleased to \Nlearn the eleventh moon's secret.
16057,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The customer will return on a hot day, leaving you alone with a man \Nbearing St. Peter's cross."
16058,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,The false fourth moon will be \Ntorn away from the calendar.
16059,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Only six pages remain.
16060,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What does your fortune say?
16061,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Let me see.
16062,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,I don't recommend it.
16063,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It'll give you a shock.
16064,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Just let me see it.
16065,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Very well.
16066,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Look at this, everyone!"
16067,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"""A red-eyed customer will visit..."""
16068,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"""The calendar's secrets..."""
16069,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"That would be our secrets, right?"
16070,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Hisoka, what is this?"
16071,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Lemme see!
16072,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, seeking to make a trade."
16073,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The customer will use the \Nsword of law upon you, taking the calendar's secrets with him."
16074,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"The eleven-legged spider grows homesick, losing five more legs."
16075,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Do not leave your temporary shelter, for you are one of the remaining legs."
16076,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hisoka...
16077,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Did you sell him out?
16078,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Sell out Uvo?!
16079,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hisoka's fortune changed when \Nit was passed to Pakunoda.
16080,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,What could that mean?
16081,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
16082,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
16083,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
16084,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hunterpedia!
16085,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,It's Gon and Killua's
16086,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Hunterpedia!
16087,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
16088,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Today, we introduce Bonolenov."
16089,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,A Phantom Troupe member.
16090,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,A member of the Phantom Troupe.
16091,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"His face, body, and powers"
16092,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Responsible for \Nguarding their base. are covered by bandages.
16093,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"When he removes the \Nbandages, strange \Nholes appear."
16094,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Spin, spin, spin!"
16095,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Next time: Allies x And x Lies.
16096,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,My Highness.
16097,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,Your Highness?
16098,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,His Highness Killua!
16099,Fortunes x Aren't x Right?,54,"Yeah, yeah."
16100,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Did you sell him out?
16101,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Sell out Uvo?!
16102,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll take that as a yes...
16103,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Outta my way!
16104,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Hold on...
16105,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Let's hear his explanation.
16106,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Explanation?
16107,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What is there to explain?
16108,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Calm down.
16109,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Didn't the boss tell us that prophecies can \Nbe avoided, depending on our actions?"
16110,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hisoka, explain what happened this week."
16111,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I cannot.
16112,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What?!
16113,Allies x And x Lies.,55,All I can say is that the first verse was true...
16114,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nothing more.
16115,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You hear that?!
16116,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Move!
16117,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Just hold on.
16118,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hisoka, why can't you explain?"
16119,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If I were to tell you the reason,"
16120,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I would be telling you \Nprecisely what I cannot say.
16121,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Thus, I cannot say."
16122,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It isn't that I won't.
16123,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I cannot.
16124,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That's all I can let you know.
16125,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If you cannot accept my answer, then in order to defend myself..."
16126,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll have no choice but to fight.
16127,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Allies x And x Lies
16128,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"After seeing Hisoka's fortune,"
16129,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Nobunaga suspects Hisoka of betraying them, and draws his sword."
16130,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Forget it.
16131,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You're impossible to deal with.
16132,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"As if, you fool!"
16133,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What?
16134,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Nobunaga, stop talking for a bit."
16135,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Huh?
16136,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Did the boss do that?
16137,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Probably.
16138,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hisoka, I have a few questions for you."
16139,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If you're unable to answer, just say so."
16140,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, \Nseeking to make a trade. \NThe customer will use the sword of law upon you, \Ntaking the calendar's secrets with him."
16141,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"In the fortune, what are \Nthe calendar's secrets?"
16142,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The powers of the Troupe's members.
16143,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Of how many members?
16144,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Seven.
16145,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"No, eight."
16146,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"The boss and Uvogin,"
16147,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Shizuku, Machi, Franklin,"
16148,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Pakunoda, Shalnark, and I add up to eight."
16149,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"So until yesterday, you didn't \Nknow of Kortopi's ability?"
16150,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That is correct.
16151,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What is our opponent's power?
16152,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I cannot say.
16153,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What about his appearance?
16154,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I cannot say.
16155,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What is your relationship to him?
16156,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I cannot say.
16157,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I understand.
16158,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"The red-eyed customer, the chain user, has two abilities at the very least."
16159,Allies x And x Lies.,55,One would be the ability he \Nused to capture Uvogin.
16160,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"The other would be the ability that \Nprevents Hisoka from speaking. seeking to make a trade. \NThe customer will use the sword of law upon you, \Ntaking the calendar's secrets with him."
16161,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Since the fortune uses the \Nphrase ""sword of law,"" the latter must be able to compel \Nyou to follow set rules."
16162,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"""Do not lie to me."""
16163,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"""Do not give out any information about me."""
16164,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Something like that.
16165,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I would also assume that he placed something inside Hisoka's body.
16166,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"A red-eyed customer will visit your shop, \Nseeking to make a trade. \NThe customer will use the sword of law upon you, \Ntaking the calendar's secrets with him."
16167,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"The first half of the verse mentions a trade, but the second half only describes \Nwhat the customer took."
16168,Allies x And x Lies.,55,This suggests that the sword \Nof law would attack Hisoka.
16169,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"In other words, he traded the \Nsword's attack for our secrets."
16170,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Oh, so lovely..."
16171,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The sword that can restrict Hisoka's \Nspeech is powerful indeed.
16172,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You are magnificent...
16173,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I absolutely must be the one to kill you.
16174,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Let's review.
16175,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We're up against the chain user.
16176,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"He's either a Manipulator who used \Nreal chains to defeat Uvo,"
16177,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nen{\i0
16178,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Is there a difference?
16179,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A big difference.
16180,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A Conjurer could walk around unarmed.
16181,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That's a huge advantage.
16182,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I see.
16183,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Conjurers have to exercise their imaginations, but it's easy to conjure \Nsomething you're familiar with."
16184,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The problem is the power \Nthat's restricting Hisoka.
16185,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Since it's the sword of law, it must \Ninvolve rules he has to follow."
16186,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Yes, it's very likely that two are the \Ncommands the boss mentioned."
16187,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Also, he's probably barred from \Nattacking the chain user."
16188,Allies x And x Lies.,55,And I'd imagine that he'll die \Nif he breaks those rules.
16189,Allies x And x Lies.,55,How amusing.
16190,Allies x And x Lies.,55,There is no sword of law in my body...
16191,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That fortune was my own creation.
16192,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I only revealed the powers of two members.
16193,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Not eight.
16194,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"It was a risky gamble that would have turned the entire Troupe against me, \Nif the boss hadn't figured that out."
16195,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"All to keep the spiders in Yorknew City, to allow me to fight the boss."
16196,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Should we leave Yorknew City, it's hard to say when I'll see the boss again."
16197,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What about Hisoka's second verse?
16198,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"""The eleven-legged spider grows homesick, losing five more legs."
16199,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Do not leave your temporary shelter, for you are one of the remaining legs."""
16200,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If he leaves our temporary shelter, this base, then Hisoka will die."
16201,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What does the homesick part mean?
16202,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It refers to our desire to go home.
16203,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If we return home, half of us will die."
16204,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I get it.
16205,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Uvo, Hisoka, Shizuku, Pakunoda, Shalnark."
16206,Allies x And x Lies.,55,One more for half the members...
16207,Allies x And x Lies.,55,No one else's fortune predicted their death?
16208,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Then it has to be Feitan, Kortopi, or me."
16209,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We didn't get our fortunes told \Nbecause we lacked the data.
16210,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I am staying here.
16211,Allies x And x Lies.,55,There's something I wish to do before I die.
16212,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I will not be leaving our temporary shelter.
16213,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Boss, what should we do?"
16214,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Leave or stay?
16215,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Stay.
16216,Allies x And x Lies.,55,No.
16217,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Huh? Why not?
16218,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You were the one who wanted to \Ncapture the Phantom Troupe.
16219,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It'd be pointless now.
16220,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But why?
16221,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"With the reward gone, you'd be \Ntaking a big risk for nothing."
16222,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Yeah, but capturing the Phantom \NTroupe would be worth it!"
16223,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You're getting your priorities mixed up.
16224,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Have you forgotten why we're here?
16225,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Greed Island{\i0
16226,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Exactly!
16227,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The Southern Piece auction begins in two days.
16228,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We need to build up our war chest!
16229,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Actually, I have a great plan \Nto get the game."
16230,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What's your plan?
16231,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It's a secret right now!
16232,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Stop being coy, and spit it out..."
16233,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You're strangling me!
16234,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'm going to die!
16235,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Anyway, I'll work something \Nout for the game."
16236,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"So for now, let's stick to the Troupe."
16237,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Do you really have a plan?
16238,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Yep, but it's not guaranteed to work."
16239,Allies x And x Lies.,55,How likely is it to work?
16240,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Huh?
16241,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What percentage do you think \Nyour plan has of working?
16242,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Seventy percent.
16243,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Seventy?
16244,Allies x And x Lies.,55,M-Maybe more like sixty...
16245,Allies x And x Lies.,55,So it's a fifty-fifty deal.
16246,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That sounds much better than trying to earn six billion in two days.
16247,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Okay, have it your way."
16248,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll let you handle the game.
16249,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But we can't deal with the Troupe alone.
16250,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We only move if Kurapika helps us.
16251,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Okay.
16252,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Boss, where are you going?"
16253,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Shopping.
16254,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I told you earlier.
16255,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Basho and I will accompany you.
16256,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Can you watch over things here, Squala?"
16257,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Sure.
16258,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'm saved!
16259,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Guard the Scarlet Eyes well.
16260,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Yeah.
16261,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"With these guys helping, I should be fine."
16262,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I'm off, then."
16263,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Yeah, see you later."
16264,Allies x And x Lies.,55,How did it go?
16265,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I couldn't get a straight answer.
16266,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The community didn't have any updates \Nregarding the auction today.
16267,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You should tell them that \Nthe Troupe is still alive!
16268,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Then the Mafia might rethink it.
16269,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"No, nothing will change."
16270,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The community values its \Nrelationship with Meteor City.
16271,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It's safe to assume that they will \Nnot attack the Troupe further.
16272,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Really?
16273,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But that wasn't the information I wanted.
16274,Allies x And x Lies.,55,My only concern is whether the \Nauction will proceed as scheduled...
16275,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"You're not planning to intercept them, are you?"
16276,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That's crazy...
16277,Allies x And x Lies.,55,How can you confront them \Nwithout Mafia support?!
16278,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"You have it wrong, Leorio."
16279,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I never had any help from the Mafia.
16280,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Kurapika, let us help."
16281,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We're willing to do anything.
16282,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Turn him down...
16283,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The reward was rescinded.
16284,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I know.
16285,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I want to stop the Phantom Troupe.
16286,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That hasn't changed.
16287,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Turn him down...
16288,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Turn him down!
16289,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You'd be risking your lives.
16290,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Come on, that's what he wants to hear."
16291,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Okay, let's put together a plan."
16292,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Uh-huh.
16293,Allies x And x Lies.,55,He agreed?!
16294,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"First, we'll need someone to watch their base, and to provide updates."
16295,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I can do that.
16296,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The target is the woman named Pakunoda.
16297,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You can ignore everyone else.
16298,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Okay.
16299,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Be very careful.
16300,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Don't worry, I won't push my luck."
16301,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll need a driver to accompany me.
16302,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Leorio, could you handle that?"
16303,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Huh?
16304,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Y-Yeah...
16305,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It'll be fine.
16306,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You'll be safe if you're with Kurapika.
16307,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hey, Killua..."
16308,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Don't make it sound like I \Nwas scared or something!
16309,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Kurapika, what about me?"
16310,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I need you to act as a decoy, \Nto throw the enemy off."
16311,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Got it.
16312,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Hold on!
16313,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Isn't that a dangerous role?
16314,Allies x And x Lies.,55,He'll have to face the Troupe members again!
16315,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That depends on our strategy.
16316,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Strategy?
16317,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What strategy will we use?
16318,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A very simple one.
16319,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"While the enemy is occupied with Gon,"
16320,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll capture Pakunoda and escape by car.
16321,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That sounds a little shaky...
16322,Allies x And x Lies.,55,There are too many uncertainties for me to devise a concrete plan.
16323,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll let Gon decide his strategy.
16324,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But I'll need you to draw their attention \Nfor at least half a second...
16325,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A full second if at all possible.
16326,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"One second, then?"
16327,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Yeah.
16328,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Draw their attention away for one second.
16329,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Can I do that?
16330,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Gon.
16331,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You are the key.
16332,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Can you handle it?
16333,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'm not sure.
16334,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll need to think about it.
16335,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We have six hours.
16336,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If the auction proceeds as scheduled, the spiders will make their move before then."
16337,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hey, why are you accepting our help now?"
16338,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Because the risk I'm taking has increased.
16339,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I have to eliminate Pakunoda immediately.
16340,Allies x And x Lies.,55,No matter the cost.
16341,Allies x And x Lies.,55,He's...
16342,Allies x And x Lies.,55,So this is why Kurapika seems so different...
16343,Allies x And x Lies.,55,His resolve is even stronger.
16344,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Kurapika,"
16345,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nen{\i0
16346,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nen{\i0
16347,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Gon, weren't you listening?"
16348,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Kurapika will die if he attacks anyone \Nwho isn't a Troupe member!
16349,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Keep your voice down!
16350,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nen{\i0
16351,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Kurapika isn't a member of the Troupe.
16352,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What I'm about to tell you \Nwill increase my risk further.
16353,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Okay.
16354,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Hey, Killua..."
16355,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I'll start with the conclusion. \NIt is indeed possible.
16356,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The five chains have different abilities.
16357,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Two of the chains are for attacking spiders.
16358,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The first is Chain Jail.
16359,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Zetsu{\i0
16360,Allies x And x Lies.,55,This power is for capturing the spiders.
16361,Allies x And x Lies.,55,And this is my Judgment Chain.
16362,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I point a blade at the target's heart, \Nthen state rules that they must follow."
16363,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"If a rule is broken, the target dies."
16364,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"As you've figured out, \NI pointed a blade at my own heart."
16365,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"At first, I devised the rule that I would die if I attacked anyone besides a spider with my chains, and I set a \Nblade pointed at myself."
16366,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But that was when I realized something.
16367,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Would using them on myself be \Nconsidered a violation of that rule?
16368,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"It was possible I would be an exception, but I didn't know for sure."
16369,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That's why I adjusted the rule.
16370,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I can only use Chain Jail against the spiders.
16371,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Meaning that I can use my Judgment \NChain on those who aren't spiders.
16372,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"But first, a condition must be met."
16373,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A condition?
16374,Allies x And x Lies.,55,This chain can only be used \Nwhen my eyes are scarlet.
16375,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You can make your eyes scarlet now?
16376,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I had to work at it.
16377,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It took a while before I could \Ndeliberately turn them scarlet.
16378,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I mastered the power in my middle finger \Nby vowing to never release this chain, and to always risk death."
16379,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The power in my pinky was \Nresolved by my unique nature.
16380,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"When my eyes are scarlet, \NI become a Specialist."
16381,Allies x And x Lies.,55,And I can use any ability I've \Nlearned at full strength.
16382,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I'm not sure what that means,"
16383,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nen{\i0
16384,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Yes.
16385,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Go ahead.
16386,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You can choose the rule to set.
16387,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I accept your resolve.
16388,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Can you make three of those blades?
16389,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"You can rescind the rule once \Nour mission is over, right?"
16390,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Killua! Leorio!
16391,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We had a little talk.
16392,Allies x And x Lies.,55,And since we're working together...
16393,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We should share the same fate.
16394,Allies x And x Lies.,55,What do you say?
16395,Allies x And x Lies.,55,The answer to both questions is yes.
16396,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But you three are wholly mistaken.
16397,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I never had any intention of \Nusing my blade on you guys.
16398,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Then why endanger yourself \Nby telling us your secret?
16399,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Gon, I wanted..."
16400,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"No, I wanted to thank all \Nof you for your resolve."
16401,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Even if one of you ends up revealing my secret,"
16402,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I will have no regrets.
16403,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I have good friends...
16404,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"That's not fair, Kurapika."
16405,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You're actually putting more \Npressure on us this way.
16406,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That was my goal.
16407,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Oh, I get it now!"
16408,Allies x And x Lies.,55,That isn't remotely funny!
16409,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Well,"
16410,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"I'll head out, then."
16411,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Can't waste any time.
16412,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Be careful, Killua!"
16413,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Yeah, I got this."
16414,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You will find eternal rest in a room filled with black merchandise.
16415,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Beware solitude above all.
16416,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You have the most to fear when \Nyou are alone with another.
16417,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"On a dark day with very little light, you will face two choices within a small room."
16418,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You must choose between pride and betrayal.
16419,Allies x And x Lies.,55,While the death-bringer hovers near.
16420,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Do not make any phone calls.
16421,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"When it matters most, you will \Nbe unable to reach anyone."
16422,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"It would be unwise to answer the phone, for the death-bringer will come \Ncalling one time in three."
16423,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Let's break into groups.
16424,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We'll spend the next week \Noperating in these groups.
16425,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Avoid moving alone.
16426,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Shizuku, Pakunoda, and Machi."
16427,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Kortopi, Phinks, and Feitan."
16428,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Nobunaga and Shalnark are with me.
16429,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Bonolenov, Franklin, and Hisoka will stay here."
16430,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Boss, can I ask a question?"
16431,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Some kids know about this place.
16432,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Kids?
16433,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Well, they didn't have anything \Nto do with the chain user."
16434,Allies x And x Lies.,55,But I'm still worried.
16435,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Yeah! I forgot!
16436,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Boss, I want to recruit that kid."
16437,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Wait, that wasn't why I mentioned them!"
16438,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Explain.
16439,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I see... He does sound interesting.
16440,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"However, it doesn't sound \Nlike he'll join the spiders."
16441,Allies x And x Lies.,55,We can convince him!
16442,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Just meet with him.
16443,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Boss, don't listen to him."
16444,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"So, Machi, why the concern?"
16445,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Um...
16446,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It's just a hunch.
16447,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Instinct, huh?"
16448,Allies x And x Lies.,55,You have sharp instincts.
16449,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It's possible that there's something \Nimportant about those kids.
16450,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"To be safe, we need more fake bases."
16451,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Kortopi, can you make ten more?"
16452,Allies x And x Lies.,55,I can do another fifty.
16453,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"And the instant anyone enters \Na fake base, I'll know."
16454,Allies x And x Lies.,55,En{\i0
16455,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Something isn't right...
16456,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Am I in the wrong place?
16457,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"No, that's impossible."
16458,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It can't be!
16459,Allies x And x Lies.,55,There are more buildings now!
16460,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"As rain comes pouring down, the operation to capture \NPakunoda commences."
16461,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit

16463,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
16464,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Hunterpedia!
16465,Allies x And x Lies.,55,It's Gon and Killua's
16466,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Hunterpedia!
16467,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
16468,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"Today, we introduce Feitan."
16469,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A Phantom Troupe member.
16470,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A member of the Phantom Troupe.
16471,Allies x And x Lies.,55,He enjoys torturing people?
16472,Allies x And x Lies.,55,A Transmuter.
16473,Allies x And x Lies.,55,He's a nasty fellow!
16474,Allies x And x Lies.,55,"A negative, cruel person who \Nenjoys torturing others."
16475,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Greed Island{\i0
16476,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Don't try to talk like he does.
16477,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Next time: Beloved x And x Beleaguered.
16478,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Shepherd.
16479,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Bow!
16480,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Maltese.
16481,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Bow!
16482,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Pomeranian.
16483,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Bow!
16484,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Gon.
16485,Allies x And x Lies.,55,Wow!
16486,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That is most likely a Conjurer's work.
16487,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, that's gotta be it."
16488,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,These buildings weren't here yesterday.
16489,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Nen{\i0
16490,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Man, these guys are really crazy..."
16491,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They have someone who can \Nconjure entire buildings!
16492,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's safe to assume that \Nthey're rigged somehow.
16493,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yeah.
16494,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That tells us they're still using \Nthis place as their base.
16495,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The problem is that these buildings create \Ntoo many blind spots.
16496,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I can only watch twenty \Npercent of the area at a time.
16497,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"However, if you move around too much, \Nyou could run into one of them."
16498,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'd like to avoid that.
16499,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I mean,"
16500,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I have no idea what I'd do if I \Nheard their voices behind me...
16501,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,My heart is pounding.
16502,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Voices?
16503,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Huh?
16504,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Oh, never mind. I read you."
16505,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"For now, return to your original position."
16506,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'll call you back in five minutes.
16507,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hello? Melody?
16508,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,How's it going on your side?
16509,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We're still shopping.
16510,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Let me see that one.
16511,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,This might be harder than \Nregular bodyguard work.
16512,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's not too bad...
16513,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Basho's about to snap.
16514,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Let's go back to the other store.
16515,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yes, I know."
16516,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Beloved x And x Beleaguered
16517,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You've already told me everything that Uvo knew about the chain user?
16518,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, when we were investigating the Nostrade Family using the Hunter website,"
16519,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Uvo pointed to three members at the top.
16520,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It was late night on the 1st when we realized \Nthey were the daughter's bodyguards.
16521,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,And I met that daughter yesterday.
16522,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,And that's when you stole her power.
16523,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yeah.
16524,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,And here is an updated list of bodyguards.
16525,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,There are two new members.
16526,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Wow.
16527,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They already have new information up?
16528,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Seven bodyguards...
16529,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Perhaps more.
16530,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's a lot of people to guard one girl.
16531,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He must love his daughter.
16532,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He probably cares more about her ability.
16533,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Her father achieved his current \Nstatus by using her power.
16534,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,There are many who resent his advancement.
16535,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,But why did she come to Yorknew City?
16536,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"For the auction, I'd imagine."
16537,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Boss?
16538,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Shizuku, Pakunoda..."
16539,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yes?
16540,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Nice...
16541,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Actually, I'm an idiot."
16542,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Damn, what's wrong with me?"
16543,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If I'd stopped to consider why their \Nboss's daughter is in Yorknew City, we could have found the chain user sooner."
16544,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's safe to assume that this \Ngirl came to Yorknew City for the auction.
16545,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I was too focused on her fortunetelling \Nto give any regard to that.
16546,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"According to the website, this girl also collects body parts."
16547,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Body parts...
16548,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The Scarlet Eyes!
16549,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yes.
16550,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The chain user joined the \NNostrade Family for a reason.
16551,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"He knew that the Scarlet Eyes \Nwould be sold at the auction, and that Nostrade's daughter \Nwould be interested in them."
16552,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The chain user desires two things.
16553,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"To exact revenge upon us, \Nand to recover his people's eyes."
16554,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Shal, were we able to steal the Scarlet Eyes?"
16555,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Sorry, I'm not sure."
16556,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I had the auctioneer running on \Nautopilot throughout the auction.
16557,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Kortopi, do you remember \Ncopying the Scarlet Eyes?"
16558,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I copied them.
16559,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,En{\i0
16560,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Can you tell where the copy is?
16561,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,If I'm touching the real one.
16562,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Found them.
16563,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Got it.
16564,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"There's something of the same shape approximately 2,500 meters in that direction."
16565,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Is the chain user there?
16566,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We should hurry.
16567,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,En{\i0
16568,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Do you have a map?
16569,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Here.
16570,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,North-northwest...
16571,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"2,500 meters."
16572,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hotel Beitacle.
16573,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Boss...
16574,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Let me go.
16575,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Please.
16576,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Very well.
16577,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,But I shall accompany you.
16578,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yes, sir."
16579,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Paku, Machi, Shizuku, you're coming, too."
16580,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Shal, you'll switch with Kortopi."
16581,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Okay.
16582,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hello?
16583,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Oh, Killua-kun?"
16584,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, who are you?"
16585,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,One of Kurapika's colleagues.
16586,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Could you look to your left?
16587,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Hang up, and then whisper a command to me."
16588,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Raise your right hand.
16589,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Her ears are super sharp!
16590,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We can use this to our advantage.
16591,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What?
16592,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Didn't we already try this place before?
16593,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hotel Beitacle is one of the places where the Nostrade Family is staying.
16594,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, but when Shal checked the website, they'd already checked out."
16595,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They probably checked into that \Nhotel under a different name.
16596,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're being cautious.
16597,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"The rain keeps me from \Nhearing what's being said, but people are talking over there."
16598,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Judging by the footsteps, \Nfive or six, including women."
16599,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're heading in the opposite \Ndirection from those ruined buildings.
16600,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's amazing.
16601,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Gon and I have trained hard, \Nbut I can't hear a thing."
16602,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,This happens to be my power.
16603,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Kurapika must be getting desperate...
16604,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He actually asked me for help.
16605,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Huh?
16606,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"He wants to do everything himself, right?"
16607,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Oh...
16608,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, that's true."
16609,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Are you an assassin?
16610,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I used to be.
16611,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,How did you know?
16612,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Your footsteps.
16613,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"You're right next to me, but they're estinto."
16614,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Es-what?
16615,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Estinto...
16616,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,A music term meaning barely audible.
16617,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Oh, I'm in the habit of moving \Nwithout making any sound."
16618,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You have the quietest step I've ever heard.
16619,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Your technique is impressive.
16620,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I can see why Kurapika would rely on you.
16621,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Well, I'm not too thrilled about this."
16622,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Oh? Really?
16623,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Stop.
16624,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're one hundred meters \Naround the next corner.
16625,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You can pick out their footsteps?
16626,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Everyone's are slightly different.
16627,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Oh...
16628,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'll take a look.
16629,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Killua?
16630,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The woman's here.
16631,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,She's with her buddies.
16632,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"There are six, moving together."
16633,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"That topknot guy's here, too."
16634,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,One more thing.
16635,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,There's one person that \Nwasn't there yesterday.
16636,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He's probably the leader.
16637,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Can you describe him?
16638,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"He's wearing a black coat, with St. Peter's cross on the back."
16639,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He has combed-back black hair.
16640,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I can't see his face.
16641,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,And they're too alert!
16642,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm too afraid to circle around in front.
16643,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Let me speak to him.
16644,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Where are you now?
16645,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,In front of the Motoba Building.
16646,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"They're walking west, \Non Continental Street."
16647,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,There's a station nearby.
16648,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Can you make it onto their train?
16649,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It depends on the circumstances.
16650,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If it's busy, I can manage."
16651,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Leorio, take us south."
16652,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Okay!
16653,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Melody's in the same car as they are.
16654,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,This train's headed toward Castor.
16655,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm in the last car.
16656,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Castor...
16657,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The auction site's that way.
16658,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,So is our hotel...
16659,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yeah. Yeah.
16660,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I know, Eliza."
16661,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm sick of this job!
16662,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I should be happy I get to \Nspend time with the dogs?
16663,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Well, it beats taking care of \Nthat spoiled brat, I guess."
16664,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I'm fond of Neon-sama, but she's too active for me."
16665,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Look at this, Eliza!"
16666,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's so cute!
16667,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Well, hang in there a little longer."
16668,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'll find a better job soon enough...
16669,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Who's there?
16670,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Room service.
16671,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Leave it in front of the door.
16672,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Okay, let's eat."
16673,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Man, I seriously need to \Nfind a different job..."
16674,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I don't have the energy for this.
16675,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,But I need a job that will support \NEliza and these guys...
16676,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's hard to find...
16677,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Huh?
16678,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Don't worry.
16679,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'll figure something out.
16680,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They got off?
16681,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They got off at Liber Station.
16682,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're headed toward the \NSaloma Department Store exit.
16683,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's not good.
16684,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The hotel's that way.
16685,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Seriously?!
16686,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They know we switched rooms?
16687,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Damn, this isn't funny!"
16688,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We need to escape fast!
16689,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I have to bring these.
16690,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The station's over there.
16691,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Shouldn't we get closer?
16692,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,No.
16693,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If we get any closer, they might sense my animosity."
16694,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Gon, the range I should stay at is the distance from here \Nto the station entrance."
16695,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I must attack from this distance \Nif I don't want to be noticed.
16696,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It will take approximately 0.5 \Nseconds to land an attack.
16697,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's more than enough \Ntime for them to evade it.
16698,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Unless they're distracted...
16699,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Spiders!
16700,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're on the move.
16701,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Descending slowly.
16702,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,An elevator.
16703,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Are they going out?
16704,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"We should hurry, boss."
16705,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We'll apprehend him as a group.
16706,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Stay close enough to provide assistance.
16707,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Pakunoda, once we capture him, \Nget the information on Uvo."
16708,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Got it.
16709,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"After that, Nobunaga, he's all yours."
16710,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Go!
16711,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're running toward the hotel.
16712,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're fast!
16713,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Can we get there faster by car?
16714,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's rush hour.
16715,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They might be faster on foot.
16716,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Kurapika!
16717,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Wait here until I contact you.
16718,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Wait, Kurapika..."
16719,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I have a good idea.
16720,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Kurapika!
16721,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Melody and I are at the station entrance.
16722,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Those six ran off to the northwest.
16723,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yeah, I'm following them!"
16724,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Wait, you're running after them?"
16725,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,That's dangerous!
16726,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They'll notice you!
16727,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Stop it!
16728,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hey!
16729,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The bastard hung up on me...
16730,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Wow! What's that?
16731,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They're ninjas...
16732,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Target moving forty kilometers \Nper hour, in a 2:00 direction."
16733,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He got in a vehicle.
16734,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I was going to wait until I found another job, but that's no longer an option."
16735,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm quitting today!
16736,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Leorio, where's Gon?"
16737,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He ran after Kurapika.
16738,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I was told to wait, \Nbut I can't just sit around."
16739,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I'm driving to Hotel Beitacle, \Nbut I'm stuck in traffic!"
16740,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Fine!
16741,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We're going after Kurapika!
16742,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Seriously...
16743,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,These people just do whatever \Nthe hell they want!
16744,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We're being followed.
16745,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,When did that happen?
16746,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Oops.
16747,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I was too focused on chasing the target.
16748,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Is the chain user behind or in front of us?
16749,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Nobunaga, Pakunoda, and Kortopi, \Npursue the target ahead."
16750,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Roger that.
16751,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Did you see them?
16752,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I only caught a silhouette.
16753,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I couldn't see their faces, \Nbut one is in the alley."
16754,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Another is behind the dumpster.
16755,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Okay.
16756,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Gyo{\i0
16757,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Yes, sir."
16758,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Spiders...
16759,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Come and get it!
16760,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Stop it, Kurapika."
16761,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We can't fight three of them if they know we're here!
16762,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Okay, then it's all or nothing."
16763,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Gon?!
16764,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Sorry!
16765,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I'll stop following, so can you let me go?"
16766,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Him again?
16767,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,This is the boy he mentioned?
16768,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"The other one's here, too."
16769,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Show yourself.
16770,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What do you want?
16771,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The Mafia who put a reward on us are gone.
16772,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Wh-What? Really?
16773,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Why?
16774,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"What do we do, boss?"
16775,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Tie them up.
16776,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Phinks? It's me.
16777,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I need you to come to the Beitacle Hotel.
16778,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Shouldn't we just kill them?
16779,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"No, I trust your instincts."
16780,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If they're connected to the \Nchain user somehow, we should keep them alive."
16781,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I wouldn't trust my instincts...
16782,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I have a question for you.
16783,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,How can you kill people who \Nhave nothing to do with you?
16784,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"You look pretty hostile, considering that you just surrendered."
16785,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Why, indeed?"
16786,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Because they have nothing to do with us?
16787,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,No.
16788,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"On second thought, it isn't that simple."
16789,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,How to verbally express our motives...
16790,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm not fond of it.
16791,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,But oddly enough...
16792,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Or perhaps it's not that odd.
16793,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Is that the key to understanding myself?
16794,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What's he talking about?
16795,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Head to the hotel, and wait \Nfor Phinks and the others."
16796,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If they try to escape, kill them."
16797,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Understood.
16798,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Now that they're on the alert, we have to keep our distance, \Nor they'll notice us."
16799,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Make sure you're concealing your presence.
16800,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Damn!
16801,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You must be patient.
16802,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I understand!
16803,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You don't understand!
16804,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Your reckless pursuit exposed \Nthem to needless danger.
16805,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Do you know why they let \Nthemselves be captured?
16806,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If you're caught here, no one will be able to stop the Troupe!"
16807,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm sorry...
16808,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Humans have to lower their \Nguard at some point.
16809,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's an endurance test.
16810,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,We must wait.
16811,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Yeah.
16812,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Where's Squala?
16813,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He isn't answering his phone.
16814,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It isn't the chain user.
16815,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,No.
16816,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He was on the list.
16817,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Get out.
16818,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm pretty good at my job.
16819,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I've survived some tight spots.
16820,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,There's a sort of gut instinct that \Nworks only in those times.
16821,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,And mine tells me that this...
16822,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,...is where I'll...
16823,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If you move an inch, I'll cut you down."
16824,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"I have a few questions, \Nso answer them honestly."
16825,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"One of your fellow bodyguards \Nuses chains, right?"
16826,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Where is he now?
16827,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What are you talking about?
16828,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Who are you people?!
16829,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Do you realize that I'm with \Nthe Nostrade Family...
16830,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Answer the question.
16831,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'll break your left arm next.
16832,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hey!
16833,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I told you not to move.
16834,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Stand perfectly still, and answer her questions."
16835,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What happened to Uvogin?
16836,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I'm talking about the huge man you captured.
16837,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,What?
16838,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,He escaped!
16839,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I don't know what happened after that!
16840,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Where are your fellow bodyguards?
16841,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,They already went back to the island.
16842,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I was on my way back!
16843,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,You shouldn't lie...
16844,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's the truth.
16845,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Why would I lie in this situation?
16846,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Let me ask you one more time.
16847,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Where is the chain user?
16848,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I don't know who you're talking about.
16849,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,None of the bodyguards uses chains!
16850,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,One last question.
16851,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Is there someone for whom you care deeply?
16852,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I wouldn't have chosen \Nthis job if there were!
16853,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,So her name's Eliza...
16854,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,She's pretty.
16855,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,If...
16856,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,If you lay one finger on Eliza—
16857,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I warned you not to move...
16858,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Twice.
16859,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Did you get any data on the chain user?
16860,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Naturally.
16861,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"It's too much trouble to explain, \Nso I'll shoot the information into you."
16862,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,With my Memory Bomb.
16863,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Recollection Bullet
16864,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Recollection Bullet \NMemory Bomb
16865,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"If you're concerned, I'll stop."
16866,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Are you stupid? Hurry up.
16867,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I see...
16868,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"So that's what you look like, Kurapika-san."
16869,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,I won't forget your name \Nand face until I kill you!
16870,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The Phantom Troupe has finally \Nidentified Uvogin's killer.
16871,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Kurapika races to rescue Gon and Killua.
16872,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The final battle draws near.
16873,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
16874,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
16875,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
16876,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hunterpedia!
16877,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,It's Gon and Killua's
16878,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Hunterpedia!
16879,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
16880,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"Today, we introduce Nobunaga."
16881,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,A Phantom Troupe member.
16882,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,An Enhancer.
16883,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,En{\i0
16884,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,An Enhancer.
16885,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"He likes Gon and Killua, in a four-meter radius."
16886,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,"He focuses aura in his sword, to strike down foes and wants to recruit \Nthem into the Troupe. with a single blow."
16887,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Single blow?
16888,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Low blow!
16889,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Next time: Initiative x And x Law.
16890,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,The keyword is dark adaptation.
16891,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Do you know?
16892,Beloved x And x Beleaguered.,56,Look it up in a dictionary.
16893,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"We didn't learn what happened to Uvo, but we have the chain user's name and face."
16894,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We still don't know his abilities.
16895,Initiative x And x Law.,57,All right.
16896,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We'll be waiting in the Hotel Beitacle lobby.
16897,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It sounds like we got the \Nchain user's identity.
16898,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He has three remaining allies.
16899,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Let's go.
16900,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Let's go.
16901,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What do we do?
16902,Initiative x And x Law.,57,There isn't any point in \Ncapturing Pakunoda now.
16903,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If I were Kurapika, I would switch targets."
16904,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If I wanted to crush the Troupe,"
16905,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I would target the boss.
16906,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Melody's listening in on the conversation, so they should know where we're going."
16907,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's a question of when he'll attack.
16908,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We'll need to confer before we move.
16909,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The first instant will decide it.
16910,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Any slight delay could cost us our lives.
16911,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Initiative x And x Law
16912,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Wait here.
16913,Initiative x And x Law.,57,They're too alert...
16914,Initiative x And x Law.,57,They'll be watching anyone who walks in.
16915,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I hope Kurapika and Melody \Narrived before us.
16916,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hey!
16917,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Do you realize what time it is?!
16918,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Idiot! It's Hotel Beitacle!
16919,Initiative x And x Law.,57,How many times do I have to repeat myself?
16920,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Leorio!
16921,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"What are you looking at, eh?"
16922,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Should I get rid of him?
16923,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Ignore him.
16924,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Don't look at him.
16925,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Eh? This ain't no show! dark because of the failures working for me!
16926,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Listen up! close my eyes{\i0
16927,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"One more mistake, and you'll get it good!"
16928,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Now listen.
16929,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Seven on the dot.
16930,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You'd best be at the hotel by then!
16931,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That's a message!
16932,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Seven on the dot!
16933,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Use darkness to our advantage!
16934,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can escape these threads instantly by dislocating my fingers.
16935,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll need 0.7 seconds to attack.
16936,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll have plenty of time!
16937,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It'll take a few seconds before their eyes adjust to the dark if the lights suddenly go out!
16938,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's time for our last song.
16939,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This request comes from Kicchomu-san.
16940,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Three more minutes!
16941,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Paku and the others are here.
16942,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Oh?
16943,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What's this? You got caught again?
16944,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I get it...
16945,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"You changed your minds and \Ndecided to join, right?"
16946,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We didn't know that the reward \Nfor you guys was rescinded.
16947,Initiative x And x Law.,57,So you screwed up again while stalking us?
16948,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Didn't learn your lesson, huh?"
16949,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But this must be fate at work.
16950,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Two more minutes.
16951,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Well, let's be friends."
16952,Initiative x And x Law.,57,No way.
16953,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We were only following you for the reward.
16954,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I wouldn't even want to look at your faces.
16955,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Smart!
16956,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Now we won't seem suspicious \Nwhen we close our eyes.
16957,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I agree.
16958,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Well, boss?"
16959,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"They've got guts, right?"
16960,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Their sass reminds me of Uvo.
16961,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That's probably because they're kids.
16962,Initiative x And x Law.,57,They know no fear.
16963,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Anyway, describe the chain user for us."
16964,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"First things first, Paku."
16965,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Check these kids again.
16966,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Okay, what do you want to know?"
16967,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What are they hiding?
16968,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Damn, that's a smart question."
16969,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Straight to the point, and he can learn all kinds \Nof information from it."
16970,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Well, there's only one minute left in this week's broadcast."
16971,Initiative x And x Law.,57,One minute! We have to buy time!
16972,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's no use.
16973,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Your power lets you draw out memories \Nfrom those you touch, right?"
16974,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"We aren't hiding anything, \Nand we know no—"
16975,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll know the truth soon enough.
16976,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Shut up.
16977,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Even if we did know something, we could think about something else, and hide it from you!"
16978,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Yep, there you go."
16979,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You seem to be confused.
16980,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I draw out the purest essence of human memory.
16981,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm not browsing through \Nthe images in your mind.
16982,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"My question will stimulate your memory, stirring up the dirt collected in its depths like throwing a stone into a pond."
16983,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"The dirt represents your pure, \Nunaltered memories."
16984,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And I simply scoop them up.
16985,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's impossible to deceive me.
16986,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll see you next week.
16987,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"This is JFN, and it's 7:00 PM."
16988,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Here it comes!
16989,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Now, it's time to ask my question."
16990,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What are you hiding?
16991,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can see them!
16992,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And they can't see us!
16993,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The kid on the right is free?
16994,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can't see!
16995,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This was their plan?
16996,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I won't let go of the other one!
16997,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Gon!
16998,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"To break the thread, I'll have to kill her!"
16999,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can't pull out my hand...
17000,Initiative x And x Law.,57,She trapped it with her muscles!
17001,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You're mine.
17002,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Once you reveal your presence, \NI can sense you."
17003,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Using the dark was meaningless.
17004,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Killua!
17005,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Give up.
17006,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A pity...
17007,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Well, it was a good shot."
17008,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It came from the entrance?
17009,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The guy with the radio was \Nworking with them.
17010,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Forget him!
17011,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We only need these two.
17012,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Our eyes will adjust shortly.
17013,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Yes.
17014,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Wait, where's the boss?"
17015,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The boss is gone...
17016,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Shizuku, hold this guy for me."
17017,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Sure.
17018,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Paku, are you okay?"
17019,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He broke my left hand and a molar...
17020,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We underestimated them.
17021,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Anyway, this is going to shock you."
17022,Initiative x And x Law.,57,These kids are—
17023,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Wait!
17024,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Pakunoda, this is for you."
17025,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Discuss their memories, and I'll kill him."
17026,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Hey, what's going on?"
17027,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We missed him because he was \Ndisguised as a receptionist!
17028,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"And, wait... the boss should have been able to evade a chain \Nattack from that distance."
17029,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But the abrupt plunge into darkness delayed his reactions.
17030,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This was all planned out! radio \Ntrapped \Nblackout \Nseven o'clock \Nchain user \Nplunge into darkness \Ndistance \Ntrue \Nwhy
17031,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"But I was only able to learn keywords what are you hiding? \Nplanned out \Nkeyword \Nsacrifice seconds \Nfragments \Nboss \Nmissed him such as ""blackout"" and ""seven o'clock."""
17032,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And there's one more question...
17033,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If these kids knew the chain user all along, why didn't my previous questioning \Ntrigger any memories?"
17034,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He must have been hiding his powers from his own allies!
17035,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"From all that, we can surmise \Nthat he is most likely intelligent, quick on his feet, secretive, \Nand level headed."
17036,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He probably isn't bluffing.
17037,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He was prepared to sacrifice a few \Nseconds to leave this message.
17038,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Which means the message must be true.
17039,Initiative x And x Law.,57,His ally can read human emotion by listening to heartbeats.
17040,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That ally is the reason he \Nleft this message behind.
17041,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If I talk, he'll sacrifice his own \Nallies and kill the boss."
17042,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But that also means that these \Nkids are valuable as hostages.
17043,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Paku.
17044,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We have a chance to rescue the boss.
17045,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Paku...
17046,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But...
17047,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Paku!
17048,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Don't say a word.
17049,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Got it?
17050,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Machi, focus on your threads."
17051,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll take him for you.
17052,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Kurapika pulled it off.
17053,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Since he left us a message, he'll contact us again."
17054,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Until then, these kids are valuable hostages."
17055,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"I am the head, and you are the legs of the spider."
17056,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Natural law dictates that the \Nlegs blindly follow the head.
17057,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"However, this simply represents \Na chain of command."
17058,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It doesn't apply to my life or death.
17059,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If I happen to die, one of you can replace me."
17060,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And there may come a time when a leg \Nhas more importance than the head.
17061,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Make the right call.
17062,Initiative x And x Law.,57,My orders are top priority.
17063,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"However, I am not your top priority."
17064,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Our goal is not to keep an individual alive, but the spider."
17065,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Never forget that.
17066,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What should we do in this situation?
17067,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If I tell everyone the chain \Nuser's powers and weaknesses that I learned, we can defeat him."
17068,Initiative x And x Law.,57,With ease.
17069,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But that will probably lead \Nto the boss' death.
17070,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Uvo must have faced a similar decision.
17071,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He died for the spider.
17072,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Died?
17073,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What did that fortune from the boss say?
17074,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"On a dark day with very little light, \Nyou will face two choices within a small room. \NYou must choose between pride and betrayal. \NWhile the death-bringer hovers near."
17075,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Two choices...
17076,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Would it be considered betrayal to speak?
17077,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Or would it be considered betrayal to lie?
17078,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It is the spider that must be kept alive.
17079,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Right...
17080,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm thinking too hard.
17081,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Paku, don't worry about it too much."
17082,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Just keep your mouth shut.
17083,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Hurry, Phinks!"
17084,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The boss has been captured!
17085,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Boss...
17086,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We still need you.
17087,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Even if it means
17088,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I must betray the spider.
17089,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's okay.
17090,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A number of the enemies were injured.
17091,Initiative x And x Law.,57,They won't move until reinforcements arrive.
17092,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What are you looking at?
17093,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Nothing.
17094,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I didn't expect the chain user to be a woman.
17095,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Did I say that I was?
17096,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You shouldn't let appearances deceive you.
17097,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Anyway, you should watch what you say."
17098,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Since it may be the last \Nthing out of your mouth.
17099,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You won't kill me.
17100,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You left your precious friends behind.
17101,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm not so composed that \NI will ignore your taunts!
17102,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Kurapika!
17103,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That's enough.
17104,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The girl's fortune didn't mention this.
17105,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Therefore, this event isn't significant enough to matter."
17106,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You bastard!
17107,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Kurapika!
17108,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If you kill him, I'll kick your ass!"
17109,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Do you need further explanation?
17110,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I consider this situation the same as an afternoon coffee break.
17111,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A peaceful outing.
17112,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Calm down, Kurapika!"
17113,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We're on equal footing now!
17114,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Nothing has changed.
17115,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Equal footing?
17116,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You are sorely mistaken.
17117,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"First of all, you've made \Nthe wrong assumption."
17118,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I have no value as a hostage.
17119,Initiative x And x Law.,57,If you insist on babbling...
17120,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He isn't lying.
17121,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Everything he says is true.
17122,Initiative x And x Law.,57,There you go.
17123,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This is reality.
17124,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You people are the ones on the ropes.
17125,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What do you mean?
17126,Initiative x And x Law.,57,His heartbeat is normal.
17127,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He isn't shaken by any of this.
17128,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He isn't worried or frightened of death.
17129,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can hear that he's accepted death.
17130,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can hear that he walks \Nwith death every day.
17131,Initiative x And x Law.,57,How is he capable of producing such a sound?
17132,Initiative x And x Law.,57,No more!
17133,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can't take any more of this!
17134,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I don't want to listen to you or him!
17135,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Melody...
17136,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He truly believes that he has \Nno value as a hostage.
17137,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But the fact remains that he is the leader.
17138,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What are you...
17139,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What are you people?
17140,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The spider.
17141,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Explain.
17142,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The lights went out.
17143,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The boss was taken in that instant.
17144,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Here's the message from the chain user.
17145,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Why didn't you go after him immediately?
17146,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Machi and Paku were injured.
17147,Initiative x And x Law.,57,So?
17148,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He has allies who are pro Hunters.
17149,Initiative x And x Law.,57,So?
17150,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Read between the lines!
17151,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It proves we can use these kids as hostages.
17152,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If we give chase and let \Nthem escape, it's over!"
17153,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The boss has probably been captured by those chains that Uvo couldn't break.
17154,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It'll be difficult for him to escape on his own!
17155,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Probably?
17156,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The lights went out!
17157,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"By the time our eyes adjusted, \Nthe boss was gone."
17158,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We weren't in any condition to move.
17159,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Okay, we can assign blame later."
17160,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"For now, we need a plan."
17161,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Five years ago, were you the \Nleader when the Troupe slaughtered the Kurta of the Scarlet Eyes?"
17162,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Answer me!
17163,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Are those the chains you used to kill Uvo?
17164,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What were Uvo's last words?
17165,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I don't remember.
17166,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You're lying.
17167,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Am I right, miss?"
17168,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can relate.
17169,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I feel the same way.
17170,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I have nothing to say to you.
17171,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Kurapika, he's trying to provoke you!"
17172,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Don't fall for it!
17173,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Damn...
17174,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Damn!
17175,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Damn!
17176,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That proves it.
17177,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm quite surprised.
17178,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The chain user has an exploitable weakness.
17179,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I can use this.
17180,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's the boss.
17181,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hello?
17182,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I have three demands.
17183,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The chain user?
17184,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The general rule is that my \Ndemands are absolute.
17185,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If you don't obey, I will kill \Nyour leader immediately."
17186,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"First, do not follow me."
17187,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Second, do not harm your two hostages."
17188,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Third, put that Pakunoda woman on the phone."
17189,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Can I ask you something first?
17190,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's about the second demand.
17191,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"The two hostages put up a struggle, and we had to break a few bones."
17192,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Then we're done negotiating.
17193,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What is it?
17194,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Sorry, I was lying."
17195,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Both of them are unharmed.
17196,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This is your last chance.
17197,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Do not fool around.
17198,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Put Pakunoda on the phone.
17199,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Ow!
17200,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hello?
17201,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You are the only one allowed \Nto hear what I say.
17202,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Move away from the others.
17203,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Did you make contact with \Na man named Squala?
17204,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Yes.
17205,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Are you aware of a woman named Melody?
17206,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I am.
17207,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Then this will be quick.
17208,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Listen carefully.
17209,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You are forbidden from \Ncommunicating with your comrades.
17210,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"No talking, gesturing, writing, \Nsignaling, or making eye contact."
17211,Initiative x And x Law.,57,None of that is allowed.
17212,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You must come alone to \Nthe place I designate.
17213,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If your heart rate changes even in \Nthe slightest, I will kill the hostage."
17214,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Understood?
17215,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Now give the phone to someone \Nbesides the previous man.
17216,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm here.
17217,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm going to meet with Pakunoda alone.
17218,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The rest of you must return to your hideout.
17219,Initiative x And x Law.,57,All ten Troupe members must be there.
17220,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If a single one is missing, I will kill the hostage."
17221,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Understood?
17222,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Yeah.
17223,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Put Pakunoda back on.
17224,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Here.
17225,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You're to come to Lingon Airport.
17226,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You have until 8:00.
17227,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And you must come alone.
17228,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Don't hesitate, Pakunoda."
17229,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Bring everyone.
17230,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He'll put his friends before his mission.
17231,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Hey, Paku!"
17232,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Wait!
17233,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Let Paku go by herself.
17234,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We're returning to the hideout.
17235,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Orders from the chain user.
17236,Initiative x And x Law.,57,What's your point?
17237,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If we disobey, he'll kill the boss!"
17238,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Are you an idiot?
17239,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If that happens, we kill the chain user."
17240,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And that will be the end.
17241,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's what the boss would tell us to do.
17242,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Nobunaga, you insult the spider."
17243,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We have to follow Pakunoda now.
17244,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This is an absolute necessity!
17245,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I concur.
17246,Initiative x And x Law.,57,There's no point in letting Paku go alone.
17247,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If we continue to follow his orders, the fortunes will come true."
17248,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I agree with Nobunaga.
17249,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We should follow his orders for now.
17250,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I agree.
17251,Initiative x And x Law.,57,For now?
17252,Initiative x And x Law.,57,How long do we listen to him?
17253,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Until half our limbs are gone?
17254,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Shizuku, what do you think?"
17255,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"When there's a fight, we flip a coin."
17256,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He's broken the rules.
17257,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But I'll side with Nobunaga.
17258,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I don't want the boss to die now.
17259,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"I don't want Paku to die, either."
17260,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'm sure Paku feels the same way.
17261,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That's why she left without a word.
17262,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I don't believe this...
17263,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Talking to you is pointless.
17264,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"I would love to kill you right now, but following Pakunoda comes first."
17265,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Wait!
17266,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Take one more step, and I'll cut you down."
17267,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Go ahead and try.
17268,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Troupe members aren't allowed to fight.
17269,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Aren't you on Nobunaga's side?
17270,Initiative x And x Law.,57,That's what my heart says.
17271,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But the rules are absolute.
17272,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"If we reject the rules, we reject the spider."
17273,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And we also reject the boss.
17274,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I don't want to do that.
17275,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's him.
17276,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll take it.
17277,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hello—
17278,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Put one of the hostages on the phone.
17279,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You little...
17280,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Here.
17281,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Are they all together?
17282,Initiative x And x Law.,57,They are right now.
17283,Initiative x And x Law.,57,But they're talking about \Ngoing after Pakunoda...
17284,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Watch your mouth, kid."
17285,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hello?
17286,Initiative x And x Law.,57,You have thirty minutes to \Nreturn to your hideout.
17287,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"You can try trickery if you want, \Nbut your leader will die."
17288,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I'll call again shortly.
17289,Initiative x And x Law.,57,We won't be able to follow Paku now.
17290,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Damn it!
17291,Initiative x And x Law.,57,The boss will die if we ten aren't together?
17292,Initiative x And x Law.,57,He's pretty smart to use the \Nhostages as messengers.
17293,Initiative x And x Law.,57,This is the perfect chance to fight the boss.
17294,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"But if I leave, the boss will die."
17295,Initiative x And x Law.,57,There you have it.
17296,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Lend me a hand.
17297,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Sure.
17298,Initiative x And x Law.,57,I've known you a little longer than Chrollo.
17299,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Kurapika's revenge has come to fruition.
17300,Initiative x And x Law.,57,And his confrontation with the \NTroupe has reached its final stage.
17301,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
17302,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
17303,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
17304,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hunterpedia!
17305,Initiative x And x Law.,57,It's Gon and Killua's
17306,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Hunterpedia!
17307,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
17308,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"Today, we introduce Pakunoda."
17309,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A Phantom Troupe member.
17310,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A Specialist.
17311,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Her power lets her see memories
17312,Initiative x And x Law.,57,A Specialist. by touching people and objects.
17313,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Her rare ability shows her \Nthe memories of the people \Nor objects she touches.
17314,Initiative x And x Law.,57,She can conjure those memories or her own into bullets to shoot.
17315,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Memory Bomb!
17316,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Next time: Signal x To x Retreat.
17317,Initiative x And x Law.,57,"What are you doing, Killua?"
17318,Initiative x And x Law.,57,Time to retreat.
17319,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Now, for verification..."
17320,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Are you Pakunoda, from the Troupe?"
17321,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Of course.
17322,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,She's telling the truth.
17323,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I will present each of you with two conditions.
17324,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you abide by them, \NI will release your leader."
17325,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Pay attention, Pakunoda."
17326,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,He's more concerned about his friends \Nthan killing me for his vengeance.
17327,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That is the chain user's weakness!
17328,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Signal x To x Retreat
17329,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'll begin with the leader.
17330,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17331,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Second...
17332,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Am I certain about this?
17333,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If I eliminate the boss, \Nthe spider will fall apart."
17334,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That was the whole idea.
17335,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But...
17336,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I have no value as a hostage.
17337,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Everything he says is true.
17338,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"But the spider can move, \Neven without a head."
17339,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The leader isn't absolute...
17340,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If necessary, the group is \Nwilling to abandon its leader."
17341,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That is the nature of the Phantom Troupe.
17342,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"I can disable their leader, \Nbut that won't cripple the Troupe!"
17343,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"However, is there any alternative?"
17344,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Is there some kind of miracle that can get me out of this bind?!
17345,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,There isn't.
17346,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I can think of nothing...
17347,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Yes, this is right."
17348,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Right now, this is what I should do."
17349,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I must get them back.
17350,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That is my top priority!
17351,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I don't want to lose any more friends!
17352,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Second, you may not contact \Nany member of the Troupe."
17353,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Those are the two conditions.
17354,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"And to make certain that you adhere to them,"
17355,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"I will use my Judgment Chain, \Nthe Arbiter Little Finger, on your leader."
17356,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"You decide if this is acceptable, Pakunoda."
17357,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Okay.
17358,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"You're next, Pakunoda."
17359,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"First, release Gon and Killua unharmed, \Nbefore midnight, without any tricks."
17360,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Second, you may not speak \Na single word about me."
17361,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you have no objections, \NI will use my chain on you."
17362,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Okay.
17363,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If Gon and Killua were being \Ncontrolled by a Manipulator, could you tell from their heartbeats?"
17364,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,It's certainly possible.
17365,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"I've met Killua-kun, and I know how \Nhis normal heartbeat sounds."
17366,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,So I could tell if anything had changed.
17367,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's good enough.
17368,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I have something to say before the exchange.
17369,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Kurapika...
17370,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"In the back of your mind, \Nyou sense that something is amiss."
17371,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why did she come alone?
17372,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If the Troupe were as merciless as expected, this deal would be impossible."
17373,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You people are the ones on the ropes.
17374,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Their rules are ironclad, and their boss accepts them."
17375,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But what about the others?
17376,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,This woman appears to be different.
17377,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,This woman you despise \Nwith everything you have is driven by the same motive that drives you.
17378,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"She wishes to save her companion, her boss."
17379,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You must have realized this.
17380,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Start by returning to your companions.
17381,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Inform them of the hostage exchange.
17382,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I want you to bring the hostages to \NLingon Airport before midnight.
17383,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Bring no one else.
17384,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Tell no one where you're going.
17385,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Very well.
17386,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You have a deal.
17387,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Take me back to the airport.
17388,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why haven't you asked any questions?
17389,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"You know who I am, don't you?"
17390,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You aren't worried?
17391,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You don't find this deal unreasonable?
17392,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Do you truly believe I'll return your leader?
17393,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Yes.
17394,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You wouldn't ask those questions if you intended to deceive me.
17395,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Does he really expect us to \Naccept those conditions?
17396,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Tell us where he is, Pakunoda."
17397,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"We'll kill the kids, then deal \Nwith the chain user."
17398,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You're insisting?
17399,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I insist.
17400,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you don't tell us, I won't let you leave."
17401,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"I refuse to tell you where he is, \Nand I am taking the kids alone."
17402,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't interfere.
17403,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Interfere? our{\i0
17404,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Go, Pakunoda."
17405,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We'll stop them.
17406,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Stop us?
17407,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Are you trying to insult us?
17408,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You're serious?
17409,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I don't get it.
17410,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Have you lost your minds?
17411,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I bet they were defeated by the \Nchain user before we arrived.
17412,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,They're probably under his control.
17413,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,This is a waste of time.
17414,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'll make them talk.
17415,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Is it really so hard to understand?
17416,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You don't understand why Pakunoda \Nwants to leave without a word?
17417,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You don't understand why \NMachi is stopping you?
17418,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You honestly think they're being controlled?
17419,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,They want to rescue your boss!
17420,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Is it so hard to understand \Nthe desire to save a friend?
17421,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Shut up, kid!"
17422,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Are you that desperate to be spared?
17423,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm not doing this for my sake.
17424,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Take back those words!
17425,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Good grief.
17426,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"I refuse. \NIf you've a problem, come here."
17427,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"The second you take a step, \NI'll rip your head off."
17428,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Then I won't budge an inch!
17429,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Kurapika isn't like you.
17430,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"No matter how much he hates someone, he wouldn't lose control and \Nkill them without mercy."
17431,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If he makes a promise, he will definitely keep his word!"
17432,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"After meeting him in person, \NPakunoda knows this."
17433,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you follow his conditions, \Nhe'll return your boss!"
17434,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"That's enough, kid..."
17435,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't think you can say anything you want!
17436,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's enough.
17437,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let Pakunoda go.
17438,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You're siding with them?
17439,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Shal, right now, what would our \Nworst-case scenario be?"
17440,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"The boss is already dead,"
17441,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Pakunoda and the others are being controlled, we can't find the chain user, and the two kids escape..."
17442,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Then, you've got it wrong."
17443,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The worst-case scenario would be that \Nwe all die and the spider perishes.
17444,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"By comparison, your scenario \Nwould be quite pleasant."
17445,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Am I wrong?
17446,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"N-No, you're right."
17447,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I don't care about your reasons.
17448,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,You're being too reliant on the boss.
17449,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If the Troupe falls apart as a result, that's the greatest betrayal you \Ncould make toward the boss."
17450,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If we keep bickering, that could well happen."
17451,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Cool off.
17452,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let them have their way...
17453,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Pakunoda can take the kids.
17454,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If the boss doesn't return, we kill the members being controlled, \Nand start to rebuild the spider."
17455,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,It's extremely simple.
17456,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm fine with that.
17457,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,If that's what it takes to satisfy you.
17458,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Well, I'm not being controlled, \Nand it won't be easy to kill me."
17459,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hello?
17460,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Put the hostages on the phone.
17461,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't break it!
17462,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Are you okay?
17463,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Are they there?
17464,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Yeah, they're all here."
17465,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hey!
17466,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We're following your orders.
17467,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Aren't you going to follow them?
17468,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The chain user can't monitor our location now.
17469,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Shut up.
17470,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If I give chase, you'll all stop me."
17471,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"For now, I'll just sit and wait."
17472,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If the boss fails to return, I'll kill you, too."
17473,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Go ahead.
17474,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Board the waiting airship.
17475,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The pilot already has his orders.
17476,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"As promised, it's just the three of them."
17477,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We can't be sure until the airship takes off.
17478,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Stay alert.
17479,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,There's someone over there.
17480,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's
17481,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hisoka!
17482,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hi...
17483,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why are you here?!
17484,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Did you sneak out?
17485,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,No need for concern...
17486,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I left a dummy behind.
17487,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hurry up.
17488,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Without needles, I can only change \Nmy face for four to five hours."
17489,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,What are you up to?
17490,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Allow me on the airship with them.
17491,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you refuse, I'll kill Gon and Killua."
17492,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Bastard...
17493,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Just kidding.
17494,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That would be such a waste.
17495,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,My target is the boss.
17496,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Once he's released, I'll get off the airship."
17497,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I want to fight him.
17498,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's all I want.
17499,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Killua, place the phone next to your heart."
17500,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"It's fine, nothing's wrong with him."
17501,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Okay, let's begin the exchange!"
17502,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you talk to or make any contact \Nwith a Troupe member, you die."
17503,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Now you will get to experience the pain of losing your home.
17504,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I've waited a long time for this moment.
17505,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Now...
17506,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let's do this.
17507,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I no longer need this.
17508,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"This won't be considered an internal spat now, so you needn't hold back."
17509,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I see.
17510,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"You aren't a Troupe member, \Nso we can talk."
17511,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I can't fight you.
17512,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Rather, I'm not worth fighting."
17513,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,He used his Judgment Chain on my heart.
17514,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17515,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We can leave.
17516,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Oh...
17517,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hisoka returned to the airship without fighting.
17518,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"The leader realized that Hisoka \Nwasn't a Troupe member, so he explained about my chains."
17519,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm not surprised that Hisoka wasn't interested
17520,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17521,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,He wasn't a Troupe member?
17522,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,No.
17523,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,How did you sneak out?
17524,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I have a friend who's good with disguises.
17525,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't worry.
17526,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I no longer have any reason to kill Chrollo.
17527,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm not interested in broken toys.
17528,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"""You can slip out now..."" There."
17529,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's right.
17530,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,My real fortune mentioned
17531,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I would have a date with the boss on Tuesday.
17532,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"And when I left, the Troupe was supposed to be \Ndown to half its members."
17533,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Fate appears to be changing, bit by bit."
17534,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm sorry for putting you in danger.
17535,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nah...
17536,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"You used your chains on the boss, right?"
17537,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Yeah, but..."
17538,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,This isn't the end.
17539,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Meow.
17540,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Where's the boss?
17541,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,He won't be coming here.
17542,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't mess with me. \NExplain yourself!
17543,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Depending on your response...
17544,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't worry.
17545,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,In return...
17546,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I can only shoot six bullets at once.
17547,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's enough for the \Nremaining founding members.
17548,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Feitan.
17549,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Phinks.
17550,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Machi.
17551,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nobunaga.
17552,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Shalnark.
17553,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Franklin.
17554,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Do you trust me?
17555,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Paku, you can't mean to..."
17556,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Hey, are you being controlled by—"
17557,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Phinks!
17558,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Have some faith.
17559,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,It's Paku.
17560,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,My memories...
17561,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,My feelings...
17562,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I pass them all to you.
17563,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Please...
17564,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let all this end with me...
17565,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Paku.
17566,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,She's dead.
17567,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,What's going on?
17568,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let me explain.
17569,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I understand everything.
17570,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Pakunoda was...
17571,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I hope Kurapika's fever doesn't break.
17572,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Yeah...
17573,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Wait, did you just say what I think you said?"
17574,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Kurapika shouldn't fight the Troupe anymore.
17575,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I thought of something when Kurapika \Ntold me about his powers.
17576,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If he'd just wanted revenge, he would have chosen different abilities."
17577,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Really?
17578,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If he'd only wanted to kill them, he wouldn't have gone to the \Ntrouble of chaining their hearts."
17579,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Maybe if he only had one target.
17580,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But Kurapika's dealing with the entire Troupe.
17581,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Even if he captures one, \Nhe can't kill them right away."
17582,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,And he needs to extract information \Nabout the other members.
17583,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Oh...
17584,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Personally,"
17585,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I think his powers were meant \Nspecifically for revenge.
17586,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Oh...
17587,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But that was his original objective.
17588,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Kurapika is different now.
17589,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I have good friends...
17590,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But you do have a point.
17591,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'd prefer him to stay still for a while.
17592,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If their boss doesn't come back, they'll be even more \Ndetermined to find Kurapika."
17593,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Yeah.
17594,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We'll have to be extremely careful when we go to the auction house.
17595,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Greed Island{\i0
17596,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Your plan is all we have to go on!
17597,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Y-Yeah, but it's a fifty-fifty deal."
17598,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Originally, didn't you say it had \Na seventy percent chance?"
17599,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I get it... That's clever.
17600,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Actually, that may be our only shot."
17601,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Realistic and sound.
17602,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I think it has an eighty percent chance!
17603,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Really?
17604,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Yeah, we can make it work!"
17605,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The auction is in Hall B.
17606,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That way. Over there.
17607,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Wow!
17608,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Huh?
17609,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why are they here?
17610,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,How would I know?!
17611,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Hey, that was cold."
17612,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,No need to run away.
17613,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why wouldn't we run away?
17614,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Don't worry.
17615,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We're not going to kill you.
17616,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Because we can't kill the chain user now.
17617,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Huh? What do you mean?
17618,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Huh?
17619,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Didn't he use his chains on the boss?
17620,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That means we can't kill him.
17621,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why not?
17622,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Isn't it the other way around?
17623,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,It's pretty useful to have someone \Nwho's willing to ask questions.
17624,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17625,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17626,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17627,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0 he could be overwhelmed by that assault.
17628,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Nen{\i0
17629,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's why we can't kill the chain user.
17630,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I'm talking too much?
17631,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I know.
17632,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,I won't say another word.
17633,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,There are{\i0 who can remove other people's{\i0
17634,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"East, huh..."
17635,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"So, we're done with you kids."
17636,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,We just came to enjoy the auction.
17637,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The other members wanted to go home.
17638,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Um, what happened to Pakunoda-san?"
17639,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,She died.
17640,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Huh?
17641,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Oh...
17642,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Why don't you run away?
17643,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Run away?
17644,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Given my injuries, you should \Nbe able to escape."
17645,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"If you did, I would lose my leverage, and the chain user could kill the boss."
17646,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,So why don't you run away?
17647,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Aren't you on his side?
17648,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Because we're his friends.
17649,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Because we're his friends, \Nwe don't want him to kill."
17650,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,So we'd prefer this to be \Nsettled with an exchange.
17651,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,What's wrong?
17652,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Let's go.
17653,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Paku...
17654,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Paku wanted to thank you.
17655,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Next week, the story moves \Ninto the Greed Island arc."
17656,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
17657,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Brush Your Teeth. \NUnripe Fruit
17658,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Coming up, we have Gon and Killua's"
17659,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hunterpedia!
17660,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,It's Gon and Killua's
17661,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hunterpedia!
17662,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
17663,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"Today, we introduce Chrollo."
17664,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Boss of the Phantom Troupe.
17665,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,The Phantom Troupe's boss.
17666,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,A Specialist.
17667,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,He's a Specialist.
17668,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"He can steal and use \Nothers' powers,"
17669,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"He can steal other people's powers for himself, using his Skill Hunter! an appropriate ability \Nfor a bandit."
17670,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,But conditions have to be met.
17671,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,"East, huh..."
17672,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Next time: Bid x And x Haste.
17673,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,A bid in haste makes waste.
17674,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,Hey!
17675,Signal x To x Retreat.,58,That's no good...
17676,Bid x And x Haste.,59,There he is.
17677,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That's your target.
17678,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"The tycoon, Mr. Battera."
17679,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Objective?
17680,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0
17681,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Why are you so interested in a game?
17682,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You've spent a considerable \Namount on it by now.
17683,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It is an expression of love.
17684,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Isn't wanting to monopolize \Nthat which you love natural?
17685,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What is this love you mention?
17686,Bid x And x Haste.,59,There are many rumors flying around.
17687,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Any comments?
17688,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I will get my hands on the clue Ging left!
17689,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Bid x And x Haste
17690,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What time is it?
17691,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Kurapika!
17692,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's 2:00 PM.
17693,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I slept for half a day?
17694,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"It's been two whole days, Kurapika..."
17695,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Where's the boss?
17696,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What about the underground auction?
17697,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It ended up being canceled.
17698,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The rest of the merchandise \Nwill be auctioned online.
17699,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The boss accepted that.
17700,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You're lying.
17701,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Eh?
17702,Bid x And x Haste.,59,She was looking forward to \Ntaking part in the auction.
17703,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I don't see her accepting that so easily...
17704,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Squala was killed.
17705,Bid x And x Haste.,59,And Eliza was inconsolable...
17706,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The Scarlet Eyes we won were stolen.
17707,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"But apparently, the boss was severely shocked by Eliza's state."
17708,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That was when she said \Nshe wanted to go home.
17709,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I see.
17710,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What about Gon and Killua?
17711,Bid x And x Haste.,59,They're both fine.
17712,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Around now...
17713,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He fell asleep.
17714,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"They're doing what they need to do, so you should get plenty of rest."
17715,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Our next item is the legendary game,"
17716,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0
17717,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Let's take a look at the mysterious \Npower this game contains.
17718,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"As you can see, there is a mysterious power that protects the console from any damage, as long as someone is playing inside."
17719,Bid x And x Haste.,59,This man is Jeitsari.
17720,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He is a player who's inside \Nthe game at this moment.
17721,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"In fact, he's the one who signed a contract allowing us to auction it off."
17722,Bid x And x Haste.,59,So this copy wasn't brought here by Ging.
17723,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Jeitsari left behind the following agreement:
17724,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"""If we cannot clear this game before the date specified in the contract, seven active players, including myself, will present seven copies \Nof the game and console to the Southern Piece Auction, \Nso our talented young Hunters can clear the game and fulfill our dream."""
17725,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Unfortunately, when we \Nobtained these copies, two already displayed game over screens."
17726,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That means the players also died in real life.
17727,Bid x And x Haste.,59,This dangerous game requires \Nthat you risk your own life!
17728,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Make sure you're prepared before you bid.
17729,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Let's start the bidding at 900 million Jenny!
17730,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I have 1 billion!
17731,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I have 1.5 billion!
17732,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#105 doubles it to 3 billion.
17733,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#71 doubles it again... to 6 billion!
17734,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Hey! That's my brother!
17735,Bid x And x Haste.,59,So you indicate how much \Nyou're bidding with your hand?
17736,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yeah, the auctioneer is able to \Ninstantly discern the highest bid."
17737,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#16 doubles it again... to 12 billion!
17738,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What's this?
17739,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"#201 doubles it again, to 24 billion!"
17740,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You idiot!
17741,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#16 bids 25 billion!
17742,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Whew, that was close..."
17743,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm guessing he wasn't able to \Ndecipher that memory card.
17744,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#71 bids 25.5 billion...
17745,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How much money does he have?
17746,Bid x And x Haste.,59,#16 goes all the way up to 30.5 billion!
17747,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Damn it!
17748,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"30.5 billion, huh?"
17749,Bid x And x Haste.,59,No matter...
17750,Bid x And x Haste.,59,If we can clear this game.
17751,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Um, we're Hunters."
17752,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0
17753,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Don't joke around. Go on home.
17754,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We're not joking! I'm a pro Hunter.
17755,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What nonsense.
17756,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Do you have a license?
17757,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Yes!
17758,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Uh, you don't."
17759,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's at the pawn shop.
17760,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Oh.
17761,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Uh, it's not on me..."
17762,Bid x And x Haste.,59,See... He's lying.
17763,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm not lying!
17764,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Hold on...
17765,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The fact that you're here means \Nyou're certainly not ordinary.
17766,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"However, I can't blindly \Naccept everything you say."
17767,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I am indeed looking to hire \NHunters in order to clear this game, but I cannot hire you at this time."
17768,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Because there can only be so many players.
17769,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Crap...
17770,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Has our plan failed?
17771,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm thinking that we don't \Nneed to buy the game.
17772,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We just want the data inside it.
17773,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"And I bet some of the people \Nwho win copies of {\i0 will be looking for players, too."
17774,Bid x And x Haste.,59,There can only be so many players?
17775,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Each memory card only has the \Ncapacity to store one player's data.
17776,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"With multitaps, you can have a \Nmaximum of eight players per console."
17777,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Oh, right."
17778,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0 all thirty blocks on that memory card.
17779,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Yeah.
17780,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How did you know that?!
17781,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0
17782,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Have you played the game before?
17783,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"No, we only have a memory card."
17784,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Does that mean...
17785,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"If that memory card is real, you would need another item to remove the card from the console."
17786,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Would that be...
17787,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The ring?
17788,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"They know about the ring, too."
17789,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It appears that they are worthy of consideration.
17790,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i0
17791,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ren{\i0
17792,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Sure!
17793,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Well?
17794,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's hopeless.
17795,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Letting them play would be a waste of time.
17796,Bid x And x Haste.,59,They'd run around in circles until they died.
17797,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How can you be certain when we haven't tried?!
17798,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"It'll be too late once you're in the game, kid."
17799,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Unless you die off immediately.
17800,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We don't need people who'll \Ndrag out the inevitable.
17801,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"As long as a player is alive inside the game, you can't reset or remove the memory card."
17802,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"In other words, you can't send in new players."
17803,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I've hired around one hundred pro and amateur Hunters to play this game, and over half of them have given up."
17804,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Given up?
17805,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"They've given up on returning to the real world, choosing to live inside the game."
17806,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That is why I must be careful \Nwhen selecting players.
17807,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We need people who are strong enough to obtain items for returning to the real world.
17808,Bid x And x Haste.,59,And you're saying we aren't strong enough?
17809,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How can he know that?
17810,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Greed Island{\i0
17811,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Speaking from my own experience, the items for returning to the real \Nworld are relatively easy to obtain."
17812,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i0
17813,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"In fact, it'd be game over in no time."
17814,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Once the screening is done, \NI'm returning to the game."
17815,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Screening?
17816,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You're screening players?
17817,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yes, the screening will be \Non the auction's final day."
17818,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"If you're interested in participating,"
17819,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i0
17820,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We were going to do that anyway!
17821,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Let's go, Killua!"
17822,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Before you go, kid..."
17823,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How did you come by a memory card?
17824,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm not telling you!
17825,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Damn it... I'm mad now.
17826,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We absolutely must pass their screening!
17827,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Screening...
17828,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What's the plan?
17829,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You even need to ask?
17830,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We're bandits.
17831,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We steal.
17832,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Let's return to the base and play.
17833,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"A memory card is already inserted, so only one more can play."
17834,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We can use a multitap.
17835,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Four more can play now.
17836,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nice...
17837,Bid x And x Haste.,59,So who goes first?
17838,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'll go first.
17839,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Whoa...
17840,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He really did disappear.
17841,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I was kind of skeptical...
17842,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What was that?
17843,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's a game. Wanna play?
17844,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'll pass.
17845,Bid x And x Haste.,59,If I feel like it.
17846,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Okay.
17847,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Catch you later, then."
17848,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"He disappeared, too."
17849,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What kind of game is this?
17850,Bid x And x Haste.,59,A game where you can actually die.
17851,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's listed in the auction catalog.
17852,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm so mad!
17853,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I can't believe how he spouted off!
17854,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Damn it!
17855,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Still, he's right."
17856,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What do you mean?
17857,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Chill out a little.
17858,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We should start thinking about \Ntaking this to the next level.
17859,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Next level?
17860,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Hatsu{\i0
17861,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"You know, our special abilities."
17862,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i0
17863,Bid x And x Haste.,59,But he was able to fight the Troupe because of his special abilities.
17864,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yeah, Kurapika obtained powers that make him basically invincible against the Troupe by placing his life on the line."
17865,Bid x And x Haste.,59,We can't follow his example.
17866,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"We need abilities without \Ntoo much or too little risk, which still fit our specialties."
17867,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Something practical and effective...
17868,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That's what we have to come up with.
17869,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Well, I knew this would happen."
17870,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Let's take this one step at a time.
17871,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"First, what kind of abilities do you want?"
17872,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What kind of abilities do I want?
17873,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Hey!
17874,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You must have at least a vague idea.
17875,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Uh, a really strong power! too{\i0"
17876,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Start by thinking within your own category.
17877,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"You're an Enhancer, so think of a power that strengthens something."
17878,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Then we ask, what part of you do you \Nwant to strengthen, and how?"
17879,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That hurt!
17880,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"What about you, then?"
17881,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I already know what I want.
17882,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That's why I'm helping you.
17883,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Really? What do you want?
17884,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's a secret.
17885,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Huh?
17886,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Gon, I'm going to go start \Npracticing my special ability."
17887,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You keep thinking about it.
17888,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Though it's possible that I'm the only \None who'll pass the screening.
17889,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He'll just get distracted unless I give him a scare.
17890,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Visualize my aura fusing with electricity.
17891,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Then I visualize the electricity being released, \Nwhile refining my {\i0"
17892,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i1 it'd be game over in no time.
17893,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Damn it!
17894,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'll make him eat those words!
17895,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"You sound determined, Gon."
17896,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Kurapika!
17897,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Are you better?
17898,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yeah, my fever broke."
17899,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm fine now.
17900,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He doesn't look fine.
17901,Bid x And x Haste.,59,But if Kurapika finds out that the spiders are still in Yorknew City...
17902,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Is there any way to stop him?
17903,Bid x And x Haste.,59,So how did the auction go?
17904,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I believe you were after an expensive game?
17905,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Oh, yeah..."
17906,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Tea
17907,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I see.
17908,Bid x And x Haste.,59,So they're screening players...
17909,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Say, what kind of training did you do?"
17910,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Once I decided to conjure chains,"
17911,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I did a lot of image training...
17912,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I closed my eyes, while feeling real chains."
17913,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I drew hundreds, thousands of sketches."
17914,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I looked at chains, licked chains... \NI also smelled and listened to chains."
17915,Bid x And x Haste.,59,My master told me to do nothing \Nbut handle chains all the time.
17916,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"After a while, he took them away."
17917,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That was when I began to hallucinate chains...
17918,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Eventually, those hallucinations \Nbegan to feel heavy and cold, and I could hear them grating."
17919,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Once I reached that point, \NI was able to conjure chains."
17920,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Other than that, I did the same training as you."
17921,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ten{\i0
17922,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I know, Kurapika..."
17923,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You can be my master!
17924,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You can point out what I'm doing right.
17925,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"This way, I can keep Kurapika occupied \Nwhile the auction takes place."
17926,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"I'm sorry, but I cannot."
17927,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Huh?
17928,Bid x And x Haste.,59,My boss will be leaving tomorrow.
17929,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I am obligated to accompany her.
17930,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You're leaving Yorknew City?
17931,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Yeah.
17932,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm still concerned about the spiders...
17933,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"But it's been two days, so they're probably already gone."
17934,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
17935,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Nen{\i0
17936,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You should probably ask them rather than me.
17937,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Special abilities? \NThat sounds like you boys.
17938,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I can tell you right now that Enhancers don't need special abilities.
17939,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Why not?
17940,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Because Enhancers are the most balanced between offense and defense.
17941,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ten{\i0 those will be strong enough to be \Nconsidered special abilities.
17942,Bid x And x Haste.,59,But I don't have time.
17943,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I have to pass a screening in four days...
17944,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Gon-kun, if I were a judge,"
17945,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I would be disappointed to see \Nan improvised special ability.
17946,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Listen carefully, Gon-kun."
17947,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You must not emulate that Kurapika person.
17948,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'm sure you don't need me to tell you why.
17949,Bid x And x Haste.,59,No...
17950,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You needn't emulate anyone else when you're already so strong.
17951,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You think so?
17952,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Of course.
17953,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
17954,Bid x And x Haste.,59,That should help you find the answer you seek.
17955,Bid x And x Haste.,59,A-A hint...
17956,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Please give me a hint!
17957,Bid x And x Haste.,59,You sound pretty flustered...
17958,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Haste makes waste.
17959,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"In the end, hard work always pays off."
17960,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I would agree if it weren't for this deadline...
17961,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"All right, here's a big hint, then."
17962,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ren{\i0
17963,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Yeah.
17964,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Next time, show him everything simultaneously."
17965,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Everything?
17966,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Yes, listen carefully."
17967,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Show him everything you've \Nlearned simultaneously.
17968,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Everything I've learned simultaneously.
17969,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ten...
17970,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Shroud myself in aura.
17971,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Zetsu...
17972,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Suppress my aura.
17973,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Ren...
17974,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Bring forth an incredible amount of aura.
17975,Bid x And x Haste.,59,And {\i0
17976,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Wait. requires me to bring forth aura,{\i0 while{\i0"
17977,Bid x And x Haste.,59,If I do them both at once...
17978,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Oh?
17979,Bid x And x Haste.,59,His brain fried again?
17980,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Hang in there, Gon."
17981,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"If you take too long,"
17982,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'll leave you behind!
17983,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's impossible...
17984,Bid x And x Haste.,59,How do I bring forth and suppress \Nsomething at the same time?
17985,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
17986,Bid x And x Haste.,59,After Wing-san helped unleash my {\i0
17987,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I went into battle knowing only {\i0 and got myself seriously hurt.
17988,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"But in the process, I mastered{\i0"
17989,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Then I learned{\i0
17990,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Gyo?
17991,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Gyo{\i0
17992,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Gyo...
17993,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Concentrate aura in your eyes to see hidden aura.
17994,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Concentrate?
17995,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Right, I concentrated on my eyes, so I never noticed what else was happening."
17996,Bid x And x Haste.,59,There's a little aura being released.
17997,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"If I can suppress it,"
17998,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I'll be doing everything at once!
17999,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Yes! I did it!
18000,Bid x And x Haste.,59,No good...
18001,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"The second I relaxed, it fell apart."
18002,Bid x And x Haste.,59,But it works!
18003,Bid x And x Haste.,59,If I can concentrate the aura \Nfrom my {\i0 that'll be a lot of power.
18004,Bid x And x Haste.,59,I want to test that power!
18005,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Gon-kun, haste makes waste."
18006,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Osu!
18007,Bid x And x Haste.,59,He finally figured something out.
18008,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"You won't beat me, Gon!"
18009,Bid x And x Haste.,59,The two boys are about to \Nundergo a new awakening.
18010,Bid x And x Haste.,59,G.I. Tutorial
18011,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!"
18012,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Today is the first episode \Nof Greed Island Tutorial!
18013,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"What does ""tutorial"" mean?"
18014,Bid x And x Haste.,59,It's like an instruction manual.
18015,Bid x And x Haste.,59,"Each week, we'll explain how the game works."
18016,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Click.
18017,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Continue!
18018,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Next time: End x And x Beginning.
18019,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Book!
18020,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Achoo!
18021,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Game!
18022,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Boom!
18023,Bid x And x Haste.,59,What's your name?
18024,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Gon!
18025,Bid x And x Haste.,59,Good job.
18026,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're really sure? You won't tell them?
18027,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yes.
18028,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Right now, they should be \Nspending every second training."
18029,End x And x Beginning.,60,Tell them we'll meet again.
18030,End x And x Beginning.,60,Sure.
18031,End x And x Beginning.,60,So long.
18032,End x And x Beginning.,60,Goodbye.
18033,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Oh, one second..."
18034,End x And x Beginning.,60,Look after Kurapika.
18035,End x And x Beginning.,60,"He acts calm, but he can be rash."
18036,End x And x Beginning.,60,"He's smart, but doesn't \Nalways think things through."
18037,End x And x Beginning.,60,"It looks like he's opened up to you, so could you act as a brake?"
18038,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yes.
18039,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're very soothing.
18040,End x And x Beginning.,60,You have the most pleasant \Nheartbeat I've heard in this city.
18041,End x And x Beginning.,60,"It's soft, expansive, and very warm."
18042,End x And x Beginning.,60,You would make an excellent \Ndoctor or teacher.
18043,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're well suited to such careers.
18044,End x And x Beginning.,60,I recommend a career change.
18045,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Well, I'll think about it."
18046,End x And x Beginning.,60,I need to get serious about this...
18047,End x And x Beginning.,60,End x And x Beginning
18048,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i0
18049,End x And x Beginning.,60,Thank you very much!
18050,End x And x Beginning.,60,That bastard's serious \Nabout buying every copy.
18051,End x And x Beginning.,60,And he's aware of my budget.
18052,End x And x Beginning.,60,Only one copy left.
18053,End x And x Beginning.,60,Damn...
18054,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm going to win this auction!
18055,End x And x Beginning.,60,What? He left?
18056,End x And x Beginning.,60,We'll see him again.
18057,End x And x Beginning.,60,He said to keep training hard.
18058,End x And x Beginning.,60,What? He didn't have to worry about that...
18059,End x And x Beginning.,60,Weren't you happy that Kurapika \Nwas leaving Yorknew City?
18060,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Sure, but he left without telling us."
18061,End x And x Beginning.,60,Here.
18062,End x And x Beginning.,60,It's from Zepile.
18063,End x And x Beginning.,60,He said that you'll see him again.
18064,End x And x Beginning.,60,What?
18065,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Zepile-san's gone, too?"
18066,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yeah, and he recovered your \Nhundred million, as promised."
18067,End x And x Beginning.,60,He really did...
18068,End x And x Beginning.,60,Now you can buy back \Nyour Hunter License.
18069,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yeah...
18070,End x And x Beginning.,60,Zepile-san really is special.
18071,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Man, that Hunter License is a real gem."
18072,End x And x Beginning.,60,The pawn shop forked over a \Nhundred million on the spot.
18073,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In a proper auction, you could \Nprobably add two zeros..."
18074,End x And x Beginning.,60,I know!
18075,End x And x Beginning.,60,I should become a pro Hunter \Nso I can sell the license...
18076,End x And x Beginning.,60,I could live off the interest alone.\NAnd forget about debt!
18077,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Okay, then let's get crackin'!"
18078,End x And x Beginning.,60,And start prepping for the Hunter Exam!
18079,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i0
18080,End x And x Beginning.,60,Thank you very much.
18081,End x And x Beginning.,60,60.2 billion..
18082,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's insane.
18083,End x And x Beginning.,60,And he won all seven copies.
18084,End x And x Beginning.,60,But it cost him half of his wealth.
18085,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i1 won at auction for 30.5 billion by Mr. Battera.
18086,End x And x Beginning.,60,"But, not to be discouraged, yesterday he \Nwon another copy for 27.8 billion, and another today for 60.2 billion."
18087,End x And x Beginning.,60,He must have some reason \Nto go so far for this game.
18088,End x And x Beginning.,60,"I've heard that upon clearing the game, \Nyou receive a treasure map."
18089,End x And x Beginning.,60,Or a giant dragon appears \Nto grant your wish.
18090,End x And x Beginning.,60,All kinds of rumors are flying around.
18091,End x And x Beginning.,60,Thank you!
18092,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm going home.
18093,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i0
18094,End x And x Beginning.,60,"He's also seeking players, \Nbut today's the deadline!"
18095,End x And x Beginning.,60,There's already an amazing \Nline outside the venue.
18096,End x And x Beginning.,60,I apologize for keeping everyone waiting.
18097,End x And x Beginning.,60,We will now begin selecting the players.
18098,End x And x Beginning.,60,"As everyone already knows,"
18099,End x And x Beginning.,60,Nen{\i0
18100,End x And x Beginning.,60,The test will proceed as follows.
18101,End x And x Beginning.,60,Nen{\i0
18102,End x And x Beginning.,60,We will then make our decision.
18103,End x And x Beginning.,60,"The judge will be the \Npro Hunter, Mr. Tsezgerra!"
18104,End x And x Beginning.,60,The Money Hunter Tsezgerra!
18105,End x And x Beginning.,60,If he's involved...
18106,End x And x Beginning.,60,This game must pay big dividends.
18107,End x And x Beginning.,60,Let us begin the test.
18108,End x And x Beginning.,60,Ren{\i0
18109,End x And x Beginning.,60,"A shutter and curtain will block \Nany view of the stage, so other applicants cannot \Nsee what's happening."
18110,End x And x Beginning.,60,"The moment we've chosen thirty-two \Nplayers, the test will end."
18111,End x And x Beginning.,60,Please step this way to take the test.
18112,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's our only explanation?
18113,End x And x Beginning.,60,Would the first applicant \Nplease step in.
18114,End x And x Beginning.,60,They only gave us a minimal explanation \Nand left everything unknown.
18115,End x And x Beginning.,60,But the others are already moving \Nlike it's the natural response.
18116,End x And x Beginning.,60,They must know.
18117,End x And x Beginning.,60,Those guys aren't going to answer any questions.
18118,End x And x Beginning.,60,Our task is simple.
18119,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Deduce all we can from the information \Nprovided, and then do our best."
18120,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm certain they're judging \Nus on the entire process.
18121,End x And x Beginning.,60,Approximately two hundred are in the hall.
18122,End x And x Beginning.,60,About a hundred have already lined up.
18123,End x And x Beginning.,60,At least fifty are watching from the sidelines.
18124,End x And x Beginning.,60,And twenty haven't moved an inch.
18125,End x And x Beginning.,60,Which group chose correctly?
18126,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Next, please."
18127,End x And x Beginning.,60,Next.
18128,End x And x Beginning.,60,Something's wrong...
18129,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Ten people have gone in, but no one's come out!"
18130,End x And x Beginning.,60,Does that mean they all passed?
18131,End x And x Beginning.,60,This is bad.
18132,End x And x Beginning.,60,Should we get in line?
18133,End x And x Beginning.,60,Those guys are hopeless...
18134,End x And x Beginning.,60,They don't stand a chance.
18135,End x And x Beginning.,60,Huh?
18136,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm talking about the ones still in line and those waiting nearby.
18137,End x And x Beginning.,60,Especially the ones \Nstanding next to the line.
18138,End x And x Beginning.,60,"They're probably waiting \Nfor someone to return, so they can ask what's inside."
18139,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If you did some research \Nand used your head, you'd see there's no rush."
18140,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In other words, you can't \Nsend in new players."
18141,End x And x Beginning.,60,That is why I must be careful \Nwhen selecting players.
18142,End x And x Beginning.,60,I get it!
18143,End x And x Beginning.,60,"This time, they aren't \Nchoosing thirty-two players!"
18144,End x And x Beginning.,60,Exactly.
18145,End x And x Beginning.,60,"It's been over ten years, \Nand no one's cleared the game."
18146,End x And x Beginning.,60,And new players can't begin \Nif old ones are still alive.
18147,End x And x Beginning.,60,Meaning that they have \Nto save a few spots in case any extraordinary \Nplayers appear.
18148,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'd guess they'll choose \Naround twenty this round...
18149,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Personally, I'd say that those in line"
18150,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nor standing nearby have no shot.
18151,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Anyone worthwhile either \Ngot in line at once, or figured out the trick and stayed in \Ntheir seats to focus, like we did."
18152,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Wouldn't you agree, kid?"
18153,End x And x Beginning.,60,Gon?
18154,End x And x Beginning.,60,You realized what was going on?
18155,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Well, it was just a hunch."
18156,End x And x Beginning.,60,I thought it was only natural that the hosts \Nwould want to test everyone here.
18157,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's true.
18158,End x And x Beginning.,60,"You win, kid."
18159,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yeah, I'm impressed."
18160,End x And x Beginning.,60,Not many people can stick to their ideals.
18161,End x And x Beginning.,60,"The steeper and more dangerous the path, the greater the need for both wit \Nand ignorance to move forward."
18162,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Next, please."
18163,End x And x Beginning.,60,My name is Puhat.
18164,End x And x Beginning.,60,Nice to meet you.
18165,End x And x Beginning.,60,People who act smart usually fail.
18166,End x And x Beginning.,60,He can hear you.
18167,End x And x Beginning.,60,But he's right.
18168,End x And x Beginning.,60,I was too focused on logically \Ndeducing the best method.
18169,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm heading over.
18170,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yep, good luck."
18171,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If I want to advance, \NI'll have to take risks."
18172,End x And x Beginning.,60,Because I've chosen a dangerous path!
18173,End x And x Beginning.,60,Listen to me... Never take risks.
18174,End x And x Beginning.,60,Act only when success is guaranteed.
18175,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Otherwise, wait."
18176,End x And x Beginning.,60,Waiting is our most crucial job.
18177,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If victory isn't assured, revealing your \Nstrength is the most foolish move to make."
18178,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's how my old man operates.
18179,End x And x Beginning.,60,But I'm no longer an assassin.
18180,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm a Hunter!
18181,End x And x Beginning.,60,Ren{\i0
18182,End x And x Beginning.,60,Hatsu{\i0
18183,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's fine.
18184,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're free to show me anything \Nthat demonstrates your power.
18185,End x And x Beginning.,60,Ren{\i0
18186,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Ndidn't represent your true power.
18187,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Then, I'll get started."
18188,End x And x Beginning.,60,He changed his aura into electricity!
18189,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In theory, it's certainly possible..."
18190,End x And x Beginning.,60,But it's unbelievable that he learned this from \Nscratch in four days!
18191,End x And x Beginning.,60,Well? Need to see more?
18192,End x And x Beginning.,60,"No, that's enough."
18193,End x And x Beginning.,60,You pass.
18194,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yes!
18195,End x And x Beginning.,60,"However, this technique could not"
18196,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nhave fully developed overnight.
18197,End x And x Beginning.,60,"You'd require years of \Ntorturous training,"
18198,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nexposing your body to strong electricity.
18199,End x And x Beginning.,60,Who are you?
18200,End x And x Beginning.,60,Strong electricity?
18201,End x And x Beginning.,60,"From birth, I've been \Nexposed to electricity."
18202,End x And x Beginning.,60,Family reasons.
18203,End x And x Beginning.,60,Seven people...
18204,End x And x Beginning.,60,That guy was right.
18205,End x And x Beginning.,60,The people who passed are those \Nwho moved immediately or waited in their seats.
18206,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Well, I wonder if Gon will be okay."
18207,End x And x Beginning.,60,Gon.
18208,End x And x Beginning.,60,Killua!
18209,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Good, you got chosen."
18210,End x And x Beginning.,60,Of course.
18211,End x And x Beginning.,60,Was that boom your doing?
18212,End x And x Beginning.,60,Uh-huh.
18213,End x And x Beginning.,60,Honestly...
18214,End x And x Beginning.,60,Those kids are scary.
18215,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Well, allow me to congratulate you."
18216,End x And x Beginning.,60,The twenty-one people \Nhere have earned the
18217,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i0
18218,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Upon clearing the game, \Nyou will receive 50 billion Jenny."
18219,End x And x Beginning.,60,"The details are in the contract, so read and sign it before \Nyou depart at 5 PM."
18220,End x And x Beginning.,60,Cheers!
18221,End x And x Beginning.,60,You've made it past the first stage.
18222,End x And x Beginning.,60,Could you look at this for us?
18223,End x And x Beginning.,60,What is it?
18224,End x And x Beginning.,60,A contract?
18225,End x And x Beginning.,60,Looks like it can be summarized in three points.
18226,End x And x Beginning.,60,"First, you can't file any claims \Nif you're injured or die."
18227,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Second, any items that you bring out"
18228,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nof the game belong to Mr. Battera.
18229,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Third, if you clear the game, you will receive a \N50-billion Jenny reward."
18230,End x And x Beginning.,60,I don't see any problems.
18231,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yep!
18232,End x And x Beginning.,60,"So once you sign it, you're good to go."
18233,End x And x Beginning.,60,That second point seems important.
18234,End x And x Beginning.,60,"""Anything that you \Nbring out of the game."""
18235,End x And x Beginning.,60,That's why he's paying the big bucks.
18236,End x And x Beginning.,60,Anything? Like what?
18237,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm willing to hand it over.
18238,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm not looking for items.
18239,End x And x Beginning.,60,I just want to get closer to Ging!
18240,End x And x Beginning.,60,See ya.
18241,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Good luck on your exam, Leorio."
18242,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yeah, you guys be careful."
18243,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Next time we see you, \Nyou'll be a doctor."
18244,End x And x Beginning.,60,Wouldn't that mean we won't see
18245,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Neach other for at least four years?
18246,End x And x Beginning.,60,We plan to clear the \Ngame much more quickly.
18247,End x And x Beginning.,60,I don't intend to fall behind.
18248,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Now, then..."
18249,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Before we begin, let me \Nexplain a few things."
18250,End x And x Beginning.,60,The individual game copies \Nare not independent.
18251,End x And x Beginning.,60,It doesn't matter which \Nconsole you start from.
18252,End x And x Beginning.,60,You will all arrive at the same place.
18253,End x And x Beginning.,60,Consider it a virtual area accessible \Nfrom any spot on this planet.
18254,End x And x Beginning.,60,Fizz...
18255,End x And x Beginning.,60,I will now hand out memory cards.
18256,End x And x Beginning.,60,You will head immediately into the game.
18257,End x And x Beginning.,60,"But first, we must decide the order."
18258,End x And x Beginning.,60,Order?
18259,End x And x Beginning.,60,Only one may enter the game area at a time.
18260,End x And x Beginning.,60,"We will decide the order now,"
18261,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nto forestall bickering inside the game.
18262,End x And x Beginning.,60,Then let's use rock-paper-scissors.
18263,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yes! I'm first!
18264,End x And x Beginning.,60,Oh?
18265,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're the boy who had a save file.
18266,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Damn, I'm 17th!"
18267,End x And x Beginning.,60,Do you want to use it?
18268,End x And x Beginning.,60,Don't worry.
18269,End x And x Beginning.,60,Your initial destination is
18270,End x And x Beginning.,60,"\Nalways the same, regardless of your save."
18271,End x And x Beginning.,60,Ging...
18272,End x And x Beginning.,60,This game is a message from Ging to me.
18273,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'm going to trust him!
18274,End x And x Beginning.,60,I'll use my own card.
18275,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Then put the ring on, \Nand start the game."
18276,End x And x Beginning.,60,Gon.
18277,End x And x Beginning.,60,Wait in the starting \Narea until I get there.
18278,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Once you see a ""Now Playing"" message,"
18279,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nthe next person can begin.
18280,End x And x Beginning.,60,Welcome to Greed Island.
18281,End x And x Beginning.,60,You must be Mr. Gon Freecss.
18282,End x And x Beginning.,60,I will now explain how the game works.
18283,End x And x Beginning.,60,Would you care to listen?
18284,End x And x Beginning.,60,Sure.
18285,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In this game, two magic spells are"
18286,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Navailable to anyone wearing a ring:
18287,End x And x Beginning.,60,Book and Gain.
18288,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Place the hand with the ring in \Nfront of you, and say, ""Book."""
18289,End x And x Beginning.,60,Book.
18290,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In this game, your task is \Nto collect certain cards."
18291,End x And x Beginning.,60,That book is for storing the \Ncards you've collected.
18292,End x And x Beginning.,60,Please look at the first page.
18293,End x And x Beginning.,60,Each slot is labeled with a number.
18294,End x And x Beginning.,60,You can only place cards of the \Nsame number in these slots.
18295,End x And x Beginning.,60,"These are your ""restricted slots."""
18296,End x And x Beginning.,60,Please flip ahead a few pages.
18297,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Wait, there aren't any numbers!"
18298,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yes, you may place any \Ncard inside these slots."
18299,End x And x Beginning.,60,"These are your ""free slots."""
18300,End x And x Beginning.,60,"There are 100 restricted slots, \Nnumbered 0 to 99."
18301,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Then, you have another 45 free slots."
18302,End x And x Beginning.,60,"To clear this game, you must \Nfill the 100 restricted slots."
18303,End x And x Beginning.,60,I just need to collect a hundred cards?
18304,End x And x Beginning.,60,Yes.
18305,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Specifically, you must \Ntransform one hundred items into cards and put them in your book."
18306,End x And x Beginning.,60,Transform them?
18307,End x And x Beginning.,60,"For example, if you obtain a sword, it will become a card \Nthe moment you get it."
18308,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If you wish to use a card as the item,"
18309,End x And x Beginning.,60,"\Nyou must use the spell ""Gain."""
18310,End x And x Beginning.,60,Gain...
18311,End x And x Beginning.,60,"However, once you've used Gain to return a card to item form, you can never transform it into a card again."
18312,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If you want to make it a card again, \Nyou must reacquire the item."
18313,End x And x Beginning.,60,Do you understand everything so far?
18314,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yeah, basically..."
18315,End x And x Beginning.,60,There are two other cases in which you cannot transform \Nan item into a card.
18316,End x And x Beginning.,60,The first is when you reach the item's maximum card transformation limit.
18317,End x And x Beginning.,60,Card transformation limit?
18318,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yes, every item in this game has \Na card transformation limit."
18319,End x And x Beginning.,60,"For example, if an item has a \Ntransformation limit of three, and three players have already"
18320,End x And x Beginning.,60,"\Ntransformed the item into a card, the fourth to find it will be \Nunable to change it into a card."
18321,End x And x Beginning.,60,In the second case...
18322,End x And x Beginning.,60,Huh?
18323,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If you don't place the card into \Nyour book within one minute, it will automatically revert to an item."
18324,End x And x Beginning.,60,"In this case, as well, you can never transform \Nthat item into a card again."
18325,End x And x Beginning.,60,Do you understand?
18326,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Yeah, kinda..."
18327,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Finally, the most important note..."
18328,End x And x Beginning.,60,I can't remember all of this...
18329,End x And x Beginning.,60,"If a player dies, their book and ring are destroyed"
18330,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nand the book's contents are lost.
18331,End x And x Beginning.,60,Does it matter anymore if you're dead?
18332,End x And x Beginning.,60,That concludes my explanation.
18333,End x And x Beginning.,60,You'll need to learn everything else
18334,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nabout the game by playing it.
18335,End x And x Beginning.,60,"Uh-huh, got it."
18336,End x And x Beginning.,60,Thanks.
18337,End x And x Beginning.,60,I wish you the best of luck.
18338,End x And x Beginning.,60,Please take those stairs.
18339,End x And x Beginning.,60,Loading save data.
18340,End x And x Beginning.,60,I have a message from Ging Freecss.
18341,End x And x Beginning.,60,From Ging?
18342,End x And x Beginning.,60,"I'm glad to see you've made it, Gon."
18343,End x And x Beginning.,60,My friends and I made this game.
18344,End x And x Beginning.,60,Enjoy yourself.
18345,End x And x Beginning.,60,"But if you expected a clue to my \Nlocation, you're out of luck."
18346,End x And x Beginning.,60,I just wanted to show \Noff this game to you.
18347,End x And x Beginning.,60,It doesn't matter what brought you here.
18348,End x And x Beginning.,60,Because you won't be able to leave
18349,End x And x Beginning.,60,\Nuntil you obtain a specific item.
18350,End x And x Beginning.,60,So play away.
18351,End x And x Beginning.,60,Gon has finally stepped foot inside
18352,End x And x Beginning.,60,Greed Island{\i0
18353,End x And x Beginning.,60,A new adventure is about to begin.

18366,End x And x Beginning.,60,You're embarrassing me!
18367,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,A field of green.
18368,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Stretching as far as I can see...
18369,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm being watched.
18370,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Someone's out there...
18371,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Invitation x And x Friend
18372,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Anyway, I have to wait for Killua."
18373,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yo, sorry to make you wait."
18374,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Do you feel something \Nconstantly watching us?
18375,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yeah, eyes this persistent \Ncan only be a human's."
18376,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,So everyone's noticed.
18377,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, they can't be too good \Nif we can sense them from here."
18378,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Just ignore it.
18379,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We're being watched.
18380,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Killua!
18381,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Sorry.
18382,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I don't see any nearby towns.
18383,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yeah, but everyone headed \Nin the same directions."
18384,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,They either went this way or that way?
18385,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Huh? How did you know?
18386,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Because that's where we're \Nbeing watched from.
18387,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But we still don't know \Nwhy they're watching us.
18388,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,True.
18389,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, let's go."
18390,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Regardless of who's watching, we should \Nstart by gathering information."
18391,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"So, how did it go?"
18392,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Hmm?
18393,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Your save data.
18394,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Book.
18395,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,How many cards were inside?
18396,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,There weren't any cards inside.
18397,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Huh? For real?
18398,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But there was a message from Ging.
18399,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What did he say?
18400,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,To enjoy the game.
18401,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Enjoy the game?
18402,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But this doesn't really feel like a game.
18403,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Book.
18404,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What do you think about the rules?
18405,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I still don't know enough yet.
18406,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What was that?
18407,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Nen{\i1
18408,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This must be your first \Ntime playing this game.

18410,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Since you're carrying a book, \Nyou must be a player."
18411,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, sure."
18412,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You can't fool me.

18421,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,How indeed?
18422,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You have zero chance if you don't \Nknow about the spell cards.
18423,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,View Killua's free slots? \NYes      No
18424,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,No cards in Killua's free slots. \NSteal card was consumed.
18425,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,And that confirms it.
18426,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,They're total newbies who just arrived.
18427,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,And they're kids.

18433,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Attack, Killua!"
18434,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You can't run from spells in this game!
18435,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Killua, are you okay?"
18436,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,My attack worked!
18437,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What did you just do to me?
18438,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This kid's dangerous!

18445,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yes, would you like to join me?"
18446,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Once we get home, \Nthere's nothing for us to do."
18447,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You really want to clear this game?
18448,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Actually, clearing it isn't my goal."
18449,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Then this relates to Troupe business?
18450,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,More or less.
18451,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Understood.
18452,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Sure.
18453,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Killua, how are you holding up?"
18454,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Hmm? I don't feel any different.
18455,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But I'm still worried.
18456,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He definitely did something to you.
18457,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,No point in worrying about it now.
18458,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Nen{\i0
18459,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"No, it's probably some magic \Nthat only works in the game."
18460,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Magic? What kind?
18461,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Beats me.
18462,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, we'll find out eventually."

18487,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Okay, begin!"
18488,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, chef."
18489,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Do you know how to use magic?
18490,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What's that?
18491,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Who's the most knowledgeable \Nperson in this city?
18492,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Knowledgeable? What's that?
18493,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This guy doesn't know anything.
18494,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He's probably just an in-game character.
18495,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Oh, no! You did it!"
18496,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Here is your prize, Galgaida."
18497,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"""1217."
18498,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"F-185."""
18499,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What does that mean?
18500,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Is this your first time seeing a card?
18501,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Galgaida \N\NOne of the island's \Nthree greatest delicacies. \NDelicious, despite its \Nappearance. The roe is \Nsaid to extend your life. \NGood boiled or grilled."
18502,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"The left number is the item's card number, and the sequence on the right \Nranks how difficult it is to obtain."
18503,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"There are ten ranks, from SS to H."
18504,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,F would be the third easiest.
18505,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,The number next to the rank is the item's \Nmaximum transformation limit.
18506,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Oh, which means this item card..."
18507,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Is nothing but junk.
18508,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I've never seen him around.
18509,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That's brutal.
18510,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He's one of the players who entered with us.
18511,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, what happened?"
18512,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,His body suddenly exploded.
18513,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,From the inside.
18514,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"We've only been inside the \Ngame for a few hours, and someone's already dead."
18515,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,And this corpse has a very real presence.
18516,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Hard to believe it's a game.
18517,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We're risking our lives here.
18518,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He disappeared?
18519,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He probably went back to the real world.
18520,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Game over.
18521,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, Killua."
18522,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Was the magic used on you earlier...
18523,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I don't know.
18524,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Don't worry.
18525,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,There's no such spell in this game.
18526,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Spell?
18527,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"As you just said, it's something like magic."
18528,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Nen{\i0
18529,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Nen{\i0
18530,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Does that mean the players are \Ntrying to kill each other?
18531,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Why?
18532,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Player hunting.
18533,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Player hunting?
18534,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I can explain later.
18535,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Anyway, are you interested in teaming up?"
18536,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We know of a sure way to clear this game.
18537,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Huh?
18538,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you're interested, follow me."
18539,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,My allies are waiting ahead.
18540,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What do we do?
18541,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Sounds suspicious.
18542,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,And we're already off to a bad start.
18543,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"As I recall, on your way here, another player \Nused an attack spell on you."
18544,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Have you been watching us?
18545,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Yeah.
18546,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,And I wasn't the only one.
18547,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Lots of people keep an eye \Non the starting point.
18548,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you come, I'll explain why."
18549,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I can also tell you about the \Nspell that was cast on you.
18550,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You're being very nice.
18551,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,There must be a catch.
18552,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We have no choice.
18553,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"This game is difficult, \Nunpleasant, and frightening."
18554,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Once you realize that, you'll be more willing to accept our offer."
18555,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, it's your first time playing, so you could use the information..."
18556,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What makes you think it's our first time?
18557,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We could be returning players.
18558,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Book.
18559,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This proves that you're beginners.
18560,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,An experienced player would react \Nby summoning his own binder.
18561,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Because you need spell cards \Nto defend yourself.
18562,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Then the spell cast on Killua...
18563,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Could only be stopped by another card.
18564,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Even when you aren't carrying any cards, you should still summon it."
18565,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,It's an important bluff.
18566,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Book.
18567,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, how do we obtain spell cards?"
18568,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"The easiest method would be to \Ngo to Masadora, City of Magic."
18569,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Masadora?
18570,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Return \N\NWarp to a city \Nof your choice. \N(Must be a city \Nyou have visited.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
18571,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Return on!
18572,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Take me to Masadora!
18573,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Killua, we should go with him."
18574,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm worried about the spell on you.
18575,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Okay?
18576,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Sure...
18577,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Is this everyone?
18578,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Yeah.
18579,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Everyone else turned me down.
18580,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Let's get started, then."
18581,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Another player was just killed.
18582,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,He arrived with the rest of you.
18583,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,His stomach exploded.
18584,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,It was the Bomber.
18585,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,The Bomber?
18586,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,The victims aren't killed by spells.
18587,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,No spell in this game is capable \Nof injuring people.
18588,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Which means that you won't be harmed or killed by any spell that's been cast on you.
18589,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,There are forty different spells.
18590,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,The one cast on you was an inspection spell.
18591,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Either Trace or Adhesion.
18592,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Trace \N\NCurrent location of one \Ntarget player will be \Navailable at all times. \N(Effect lasts until player \Nleaves the game.) \N\N[SR][ATK]
18593,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"In short, once the enemy uses these on you,"
18594,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Adhesion \N\NComplete data of one target \Nplayer's restricted slots will \Nbe available at all times. \N(Effect lasts until player \Nleaves the game.) \N\N[SR][ATK] he will then know everything about you.
18595,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I get it.
18596,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That's why...
18597,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Some players wait near the starting point in order to cast these spells on new players.
18598,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"As soon as a player obtains a valuable card, they'll show up and steal it."
18599,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"In some cases, they kill their target."
18600,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Like the guy who just died?
18601,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I won't be that easy to kill.
18602,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"No, he was killed by something else."
18603,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,There is a violent faction hunting players.
18604,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This was done by one of them...
18605,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,The Bomber.
18606,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Bomber...
18607,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"In this game, there are three \Nways to acquire item cards."
18608,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Do you know what they are?
18609,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Find them yourself.
18610,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Trade with other players.
18611,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Steal them from other players.
18612,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yes, those are the three ways."
18613,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"However, the number of players stealing \Nfrom others has recently increased."
18614,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That's due to the card's difficulty to obtain \Nand the card transformation limit system.
18615,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Players who can't obtain cards themselves choose to take them from others.
18616,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If those players resist, they're killed."
18617,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"When they die, their ring disappears, \Nand their cards are lost."
18618,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"However, it increases the transformation \Nlimit of that type of card."
18619,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you kill a player, you can't take his cards."
18620,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That rule was meant to keep \Nplayers from killing one another.
18621,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"But now, it's backfiring."
18622,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,It's been over ten years since the game's release.
18623,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If no one can find a way to beat it, the killing will only continue."
18624,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That's why we're trying to end this mess.
18625,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We're recruiting allies to clear this game.
18626,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We need your help.
18627,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,How do you plan to obtain cards?
18628,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,1) Find them yourself.
18629,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,2) Trade for them.
18630,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,3) Steal them.
18631,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Which method will you use?
18632,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,3...
18633,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"I assume you mean to use all three methods, but 3 will be the primary method."
18634,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"What, so you'll still use force?"
18635,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,No!
18636,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We won't use violence to reach our goal.
18637,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Spells.
18638,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You'll use spells.
18639,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Am I right?
18640,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Correct.
18641,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"There are certain spells for taking cards, and there are cards that \Ndefend against those spells."
18642,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We'll focus on monopolizing these cards.
18643,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We're going to use the very \Ncard transformation limit that's frustrated the players.
18644,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This is the only way to clear the game.
18645,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"I have met many players, and they \Nall reached the same conclusion."
18646,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Even if you search for cards, \Nthey'll be taken from you eventually."
18647,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Because this game is based on \Nplayers taking cards from each other.
18648,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"We will ensure that we can take \Ncards from other players, while mitigating our risk of losing cards."
18649,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You're leaving out something important.
18650,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Upon clearing the game, \Nhow will you split the reward?"
18651,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?"
18652,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,So you knew who we were when you invited us.
18653,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Yeah.
18654,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game.
18655,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That means the reward will be 50 billion.
18656,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We'll split it among everyone who helps.
18657,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Currently, we have fifty-three players."
18658,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"It'll take two months to collect \Nthe remaining spell cards, and one month to get the cards we need."
18659,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We can finish in three months.
18660,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Of course, if you join us, we'll remove any spells cast on you."
18661,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm in.
18662,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion.
18663,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But I like the three month schedule \Nfor clearing the game.
18664,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What about you?
18665,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I have a question.
18666,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If I obtain an SS rank card on \Nmy own, what's my cut?"
18667,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Naturally, you'd receive 500 million \Nfor a card of that rank."
18668,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Okay, I'm in."
18669,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What about you two?
18670,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Killua, sorry."
18671,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Hmm? What?
18672,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm out.
18673,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm playing this game on my own.
18674,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You heard the leader.
18675,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I have to pass.
18676,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, Gon! Wait up..."
18677,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,What about you?
18678,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"We'll need you to first exit the game, so the spells placed on you can be removed."
18679,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Once you're back in the game, \Nwait by the starting point."
18680,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We'll come get you.
18681,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you have any cards in your free slots, give them to me now."
18682,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Why?
18683,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"When you leave the game, the cards in your free slots disappear."
18684,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I believe your data automatically \Nsaves when cards are put in or removed from restricted slots.
18685,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Yes, but your data disappears if you don't return within ten days."
18686,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you don't return before then, \Nwe'll assume that you gave up."
18687,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Got it?
18688,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally."
18689,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,We don't know if anyone's watching.
18690,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Let's get started.
18691,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Leave \N\NSend one \Ntarget player \Noff the island. \N\N[SR][NORM]
18692,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'll be using the Leave card.
18693,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, Gon..."
18694,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Will you explain what that was about?
18695,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Sorry, Killua."
18696,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I couldn't take it anymore.
18697,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I still don't get why you're apologizing.
18698,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But this means you'll be stuck \Nwith that spell for a while.
18699,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Oh, that's why."
18700,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,It's not a big deal.
18701,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But you're playing this game to help me find my dad...
18702,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You're wrong.
18703,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm playing this game because...
18704,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Anyway, why were you so mad?"
18705,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Because they had nothing \Nbut bad things to say about the game Ging made, like how \Nit's based on killing and stealing."
18706,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"I want to do what Ging said, \Nand enjoy the game."
18707,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"When I first started,"
18708,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I knew it wouldn't be easy.
18709,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That was because I thought all the \Nplayers enjoyed playing the game.
18710,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,People have died.
18711,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"But it's the player mentality, \Nnot the game, that scares me."
18712,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,They're willing to hurt others to get cards.
18713,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Really?
18714,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I think it makes sense.
18715,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Killua, you really mean that?"
18716,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,That's why this game is meant for Hunters.
18717,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But...
18718,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Killing is wrong.
18719,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I agree with you on that part.
18720,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"But what if two players have a fair \Nfight with predetermined rules, and the winner gets to take a card?"
18721,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Th-That's acceptable.
18722,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,See?
18723,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"When that guy cast a spell on me and when those guys carry out their plan, they're just following the game's rules."
18724,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Yeah.
18725,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Though it does still feel lame.
18726,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Well, forget about them."
18727,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Let's enjoy this game.
18728,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Killua...
18729,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Hmm?
18730,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Thanks.
18731,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm glad you came with me.
18732,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,No...
18733,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm glad I got to know you!
18734,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Cut it out, stupid."
18735,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You're embarrassing me.
18736,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Why? I really mean it.
18737,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,You've got it backwards.
18738,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Gon, I should thank you."
18739,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I'm the one who's glad that I got to know you...
18740,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I understand.
18741,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,So that's why.
18742,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Such a beautiful thing, the friendship \Nand innocence of two young boys."
18743,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,I feel like messing with them.
18744,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Gon and Killua have \Nreaffirmed their friendship.
18745,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,But who is the girl watching them?
18746,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,G.I. Tutorial
18747,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!"
18748,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Today, we introduce the card Return."
18749,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Return \N\NWarp to a city \Nof your choice. \N(Must be a city \Nyou have visited.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
18750,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,This travel card lets you instantly warp to a city you've visited before.
18751,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Return on!
18752,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Mito-san's place.
18753,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,It only works for places inside the game.
18754,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Huh?
18755,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Continue!
18756,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Next time: Reality x And x Raw.
18757,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"If you polish a raw diamond, you can make it shine!"
18758,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,"Hey, a shooting star!"
18759,Invitation x and x Friend.,61,Shiny.
18760,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Championship Finals, round 7!"
18761,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Ready...
18762,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Go!
18763,Reality x And x Raw.,62,First comes rock...
18764,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Rock... Paper...
18765,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Scissors!
18766,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Killua wins!
18767,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yes!
18768,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Congratulations.
18769,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Here is your prize, the Sword of Truth."
18770,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Look, Gon..."
18771,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Sword of Truth \N\NSword that cuts through \Nanything false. Has been \Nused in trials to determine \Ncriminals. Breaks if used \Nto cut something true, \Nbut will regenerate if left \Nin scabbard for a day."
18772,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This is card #83.
18773,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It goes in a restricted slot.
18774,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Okay, that's one down."
18775,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Score!
18776,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Reality x And x Raw
18777,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The problem is how we protect the card.
18778,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We don't have any defensive spell cards.
18779,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Wait, kids!"
18780,Reality x And x Raw.,62,H-Hand over the Sword of Truth!
18781,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Do as I say, and I won't be rough with you."
18782,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"No way, stupid."
18783,Reality x And x Raw.,62,W-Wait!
18784,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Book!
18785,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Book!
18786,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Hmph, you're bluffing."
18787,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I know that you just started this game.
18788,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"You have no defensive spells, and all you would have in your restricted slots is the Sword of Truth."
18789,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This is Thief!
18790,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Thief \N\NSteal one random card \Nfrom a restricted slot \Nof one target player. \N\N[SR][ATK]
18791,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This spell card lets you steal one random card from \Nanother player's restricted slots!
18792,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Take this...
18793,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Thief on!
18794,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Attack Killua!
18795,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Haven't you been training at all,"
18796,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Mister?
18797,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Next time, I won't return your card."
18798,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You must be an amateur.
18799,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm impressed you got into a game for Hunters.
18800,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But that was very educational.
18801,Reality x And x Raw.,62,An attack spell won't kick in \Nuntil you finish the chant.
18802,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Th-That only works against weak players!
18803,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Precisely.
18804,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If you want a card, \Nyou take it from someone."
18805,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Only fools would participate in tournaments.
18806,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Understand, boys?"
18807,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm so pissed!
18808,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Just forget it.
18809,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Those guys were obviously pros.
18810,Reality x And x Raw.,62,At least we didn't waste too much effort.
18811,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Damn it!
18812,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Then I'm gonna start getting spell cards!
18813,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"That means our next destination \Nwill be Masadora, City of Magic."
18814,Reality x And x Raw.,62,No objections!
18815,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's our base.
18816,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We'll begin assigning roles.
18817,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You will collect spell cards for us.
18818,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You've probably heard that there \Nare forty different spell cards.
18819,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"We need you to obtain \None of those cards, Prison."
18820,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Prison \N\NAll slotted cards on target \Npage are immune to theft \Nor destruction via spell \Ncard until removed from \Ntheir slot. (Can only \Ntarget pages 1 - 11. \NFree slot pages \Ncannot be targeted.) \N\N[DEF][CONT]
18821,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This is one of the strongest defensive spells.
18822,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We could certainly use another one of these.
18823,Reality x And x Raw.,62,In order to protect Breath of Archangel.
18824,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Breath of Archangel?
18825,Reality x And x Raw.,62,A super-rare SS card that no one's ever been able to obtain.
18826,Reality x And x Raw.,62,How can you be certain no \None's gotten one before?
18827,Reality x And x Raw.,62,List \N\NReveal number of card \Nholders and number of \Ncards for a target item. \N\N[LR][NORM]
18828,Reality x And x Raw.,62,There's a spell card called List.
18829,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"When you cast it, you can learn the maximum \Ntransformation limit of any card as well as the number of current card holders."
18830,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I see.
18831,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The card is very difficult to obtain because you must have all forty spell \Ncards before you can trade for one.
18832,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"But spell cards are extremely \Nuseful in this game, so players tend to use them up."
18833,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"However, we've been able to collect all forty spell cards."
18834,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We would prefer to trade them in for \Na Breath of Archangel at once...
18835,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But then you'd have no cards to protect it.
18836,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's why you need a copy of Prison.
18837,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Exactly.
18838,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"At any rate, to carry out this plan, we'll need you all to memorize \Nthe forty different spell cards."
18839,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Those four Galgaida cards \Nnetted us 120,000 Jenny."
18840,Reality x And x Raw.,62,They were pretty valuable.
18841,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We don't need to worry about money now.
18842,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Let's buy some food and water, \Nso we can start for Masadora!"
18843,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"First, we'll need a map."
18844,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Map of Island \N\NA detailed map \Nshowing cities \Nand important \Nlocations, as well \Nas useful information \Nsuch as hot spots!"
18845,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Map of Island \N\NA blank map that \Nautomatically fills in \Nlocations as the owner \Nvisits and gathers \Ninformation about them.
18846,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"The one with information costs 650,000, while the blank one is 20,000."
18847,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Which one should we get?
18848,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"The 20,000 one."
18849,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It'll be more fun to fill it in ourselves.
18850,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"You're so positive, it's painful."
18851,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gain.
18852,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This doesn't tell us anything.
18853,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Then let's ask.
18854,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Head north for eighty kilometers.
18855,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"After you pass the mountain, \Nyou'll reach a lake."
18856,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If you follow the lake north, \Nyou should reach Masadora."
18857,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If we hurry, we can go \Neighty kilometers in a day."
18858,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yep.
18859,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Assuming you survive.
18860,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The mountain is crawling with bandits.
18861,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"And once you pass the mountain, \Nyou'll encounter hordes of monsters."
18862,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Bandits?
18863,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Monsters?
18864,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Now it sounds more like an RPG!
18865,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I wanna see these monsters!
18866,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Let's hurry up!
18867,Reality x And x Raw.,62,All right!
18868,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Off we go!
18869,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Please wait!
18870,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I beg you!
18871,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What?
18872,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Please let me join you!
18873,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Oh, sorry."
18874,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Can't.
18875,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Wh-Why not?
18876,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You'd be a nuisance.
18877,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Little brat...
18878,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You dare call me a nuisance?
18879,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If I chose to, I could mop the floor with \Nyou, with one hand behind my back."
18880,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That does it.
18881,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"I was just going to tease these boys a little, but now I'm going to ruin their lives."
18882,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Hey, hold it right there!"
18883,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Please!
18884,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'll try really hard not to get in your way!
18885,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Okay, I have most of the information we need."
18886,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Then, can you tell us what you found?"
18887,Reality x And x Raw.,62,All right. I'll start with number one.
18888,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"I tried a hundred different people in this city, and they all gave the same response when faced with an unusual question."
18889,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This is typical behavior \Nfor in-game characters.
18890,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Number two.
18891,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Book.
18892,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Rock \N\NA normal rock found \Non the ground. \NDoes decent damage \Nwhen thrown.
18893,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This card is real.
18894,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This one is a copy Kortopi made.
18895,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gain.
18896,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Kortopi's card didn't transform.
18897,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I believe that means the game's program didn't recognize Kortopi's card.
18898,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Number three.
18899,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Shizuku's vacuum works in this world, but it won't work on any items \Nwith special abilities."
18900,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I think that's because the game was programmed
18901,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Nen{\i0
18902,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So?
18903,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"However, the above three points indicate another possibility."
18904,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This game isn't taking place \Nin a virtual world.
18905,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It's based somewhere in the real world.
18906,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What do you mean?
18907,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If the players actually entered the game, their spirits would detach from \Ntheir bodies and enter the console, leaving the bodies behind."
18908,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Sending them physically into the \Ngame would be unnecessary.
18909,Reality x And x Raw.,62,And separating spirit from \Nbody should require more
18910,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Hatsu{\i0
18911,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It's more logical that the players \Nare actually warped elsewhere.
18912,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Thus,"
18913,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Greed Island{\i0
18914,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Hatsu{\i0
18915,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That makes sense.
18916,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But what does it mean?
18917,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Do you remember the reward \Nfor clearing this game?
18918,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Let's see...
18919,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What was it?
18920,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"You can select three item cards from your restricted slots, \Nto take back to the real world."
18921,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Right.
18922,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That means these items can \Nbe used outside the island.
18923,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If this game takes place in the real world, it should be possible to remove the treasure without clearing the game."
18924,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I understand.
18925,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Book.
18926,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"At the moment, we only \Nknow about a few items."
18927,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It would be ideal to learn all of the cards.
18928,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So our first objective is \Nthe spell card God Eye.
18929,Reality x And x Raw.,62,God Eye \N\NGrants the user the effects \Nof Analysis and List on \Ncards 001-099 at any time. \N(Effect lasts until player \Nleaves the game.) \N\N[LR][CONT]
18930,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Now we just need to find Phinks and Feitan.
18931,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Another cheap map?
18932,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But he was carrying a lot of spell cards.
18933,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Well, let's split up for now."
18934,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"In one week, we'll meet in Masadora."
18935,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It's a contest to see who \Ncan kill more players.
18936,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Okay, be sure to take their cards first."
18937,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Hey, what should we do about her?"
18938,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Just ignore her.
18939,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Once the bandits show up, \Nwe'll have a chance to ditch her."
18940,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Isn't that kind of mean?
18941,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What are you talking about?
18942,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Nen{\i0
18943,Reality x And x Raw.,62,She should be able to escape if it gets hairy.
18944,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I didn't think she'd keep up this long.
18945,Reality x And x Raw.,62,They have considerable physical strength.
18946,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"For a couple of kids, anyway."
18947,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Let's take them.
18948,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yeah.
18949,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Please help us!
18950,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We beg you!
18951,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Huh?
18952,Reality x And x Raw.,62,A disease is going around the island.
18953,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"It starts with a mild fever, grows to a high fever, and \Neventually leads to death."
18954,Reality x And x Raw.,62,All we can do is use medicine \Nto keep the fever in check.
18955,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But the medicine will only work for a week.
18956,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"It's also incredibly expensive, and we've run out of money..."
18957,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"We've all fallen ill, so we're unable to do any bandit work."
18958,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Is it contagious?
18959,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's just a scenario.
18960,Reality x And x Raw.,62,My son only has two or three days to live!
18961,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Could you spare us any money?
18962,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"This is an in-game event, right?"
18963,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Yeah, if we give them money, they should provide us with \Nitems or information."
18964,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Uh, how much do you need?"
18965,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"80,000 Jenny."
18966,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's all we have left.
18967,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So they know everything about us.
18968,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Um,"
18969,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"I have enough to cover 80,000 Jenny."
18970,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Ah, could you shut up for a moment?"
18971,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm gonna kill that brat.
18972,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Got it.
18973,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"We can give you 80,000 Jenny."
18974,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Really?
18975,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Thank you so much!
18976,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You've saved my son's life!
18977,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm c-cold.
18978,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So cold...
18979,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Oh, no!"
18980,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If his body gets any colder, he'll die before we can \Nget him the medicine!"
18981,Reality x And x Raw.,62,If only we had some children's clothes!
18982,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Some children's clothes!
18983,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Um, I can give him my clothes."
18984,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That'd really be okay?
18985,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You're like angels!
18986,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Words are not enough...
18987,Reality x And x Raw.,62,...to express our gratitude!
18988,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Nah, we don't need thanks."
18989,Reality x And x Raw.,62,How about some information or items?
18990,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We got nothing?
18991,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"We lost our clothes, \Nand now we're totally broke."
18992,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Damn, they're mocking us!"
18993,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What was that about?
18994,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"But once we get past this mountain, we'll find lots of monsters, right?"
18995,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yeah.
18996,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If we beat them and turn them into cards, \Nwe can sell them for lots of cash."
18997,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We finally get to start fighting!
18998,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Time to see what you've got.
18999,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Ditto.
19000,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I wanna see what you accomplished \Nduring your secret training.
19001,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This area is rocky...
19002,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Let's go!
19003,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yeah!
19004,Reality x And x Raw.,62,There are tons of them!
19005,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gon's punch did no damage?
19006,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So no amount of punching will take one down.
19007,Reality x And x Raw.,62,And there are so many.
19008,Reality x And x Raw.,62,In order to disable it with a single attack...
19009,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Bingo! The eye is its weakness.
19010,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Book.
19011,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Gon, aim for the eye!"
19012,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Got it!
19013,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"They're moving around too much, but they're doing reasonably well."
19014,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Weaker than they looked.
19015,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The card reverted after we \Nleft it alone for a minute.
19016,Reality x And x Raw.,62,We can do this.
19017,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The monsters come with weaknesses.
19018,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If we stay calm and think, we'll be fine."
19019,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Okay.
19020,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Let's head for Masadora, then."
19021,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yeah!
19022,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Huh?
19023,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gon!
19024,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm okay!
19025,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That didn't hurt.
19026,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This one's weak.
19027,Reality x And x Raw.,62,But it's fast!
19028,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Let's catch it.
19029,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Damn!
19030,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Watch the trajectory, \Nnot its current location."
19031,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"With observation, you can learn an \Nopponent's pattern of motion."
19032,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Your eyes are sharp, but you \Naren't using them properly."
19033,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It got away from us.
19034,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Well, it won't take very \Nlong to reach Masadora if they're all this weak."
19035,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Don't be stupid!
19036,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What if you encounter a monster \Nthat's both strong and fast?
19037,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Bubbles?
19038,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It's gone...
19039,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"It's loud and generates a shock wave, but it doesn't do any damage."
19040,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"When you touch them, the red ones don't pop."
19041,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The white bubbles pop when they make contact with a human aura.
19042,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The red ones pop when they make \Ncontact with anything else.
19043,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"To catch that horse, you must \Nidentify which bubble is which, then switch between{\i0"
19044,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's still too difficult for them.
19045,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Still...
19046,Reality x And x Raw.,62,These boys are...
19047,Reality x And x Raw.,62,These boys are just wasting their potential!
19048,Reality x And x Raw.,62,They're raw stones that'll shine like \Ndiamonds with a little polishing!
19049,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"But at this rate, they'll run into \Nstronger players or monsters, and it'll be game over!"
19050,Reality x And x Raw.,62,This one looks tougher.
19051,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's it...
19052,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I've had enough!
19053,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo!
19054,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Keep your eyes on it!
19055,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo{\i0
19056,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Don't you know how?
19057,Reality x And x Raw.,62,See that?
19058,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"The armor's just a puppet, so attacks won't work against it."
19059,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Here it is!
19060,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I got the card!
19061,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo{\i0
19062,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Why didn't you use it before?
19063,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Uh, well..."
19064,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Yeah...
19065,Reality x And x Raw.,62,So you forgot.
19066,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Why are you just standing there?
19067,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo!
19068,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What do you see?
19069,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The number 1.
19070,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Good.
19071,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Listen up.
19072,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo{\i0
19073,Reality x And x Raw.,62,And then you holler out what you see.
19074,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Gyo{\i0
19075,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Got it?
19076,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Wait, why are you ordering us around?"
19077,Reality x And x Raw.,62,The number 5!
19078,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Correct.
19079,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Drop and give me two hundred push-ups.
19080,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Huh?
19081,Reality x And x Raw.,62,It's your punishment!
19082,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Get to it!
19083,Reality x And x Raw.,62,What the hell? Why should I?
19084,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Got a problem?
19085,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You bet!
19086,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Who do you think you are?
19087,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet."
19088,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
19089,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Nen{\i0
19090,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I'm going to use my wealth of \Nknowledge and experience to coach you boys.
19091,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You should be grateful.
19092,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Forty years ago?!
19093,Reality x And x Raw.,62,You're an old hag!
19094,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"As it turns out, the young girl \Nfollowing Gon and Killua is a highly experienced pro Hunter."
19095,Reality x And x Raw.,62,G.I. Tutorial
19096,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
19097,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"Today, we'll introduce the card God Eye."
19098,Reality x And x Raw.,62,God Eye \N\NGrants the user the effects \Nof Analysis and List on \Ncards 001-099 at any time. \N(Effect lasts until player \Nleaves the game.) \N\N[LR][CONT]
19099,Reality x And x Raw.,62,That's the card Shalnark wants.
19100,Reality x And x Raw.,62,"If you use this spell, you get \Na description of a given card, number of holders, and total \Nnumber of cards in existence."
19101,Reality x And x Raw.,62,I want one!
19102,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Continue!
19103,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Next time: A x Hard x Master.
19104,Reality x And x Raw.,62,My master is Wing-san!
19105,Reality x And x Raw.,62,My master is—
19106,Reality x And x Raw.,62,P-Pow!
19107,Reality x And x Raw.,62,Another bump on the head...
19108,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
19109,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I'm not big on formalities, so call me Bisky."
19110,A x Hard x Master.,63,"In return, you must obey every \Nword of what I teach you."
19111,A x Hard x Master.,63,"No way. And no, thanks."
19112,A x Hard x Master.,63,We're not desperate enough to beg \Na total stranger to train us!
19113,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Say something, Gon."
19114,A x Hard x Master.,63,We have Wing-san.
19115,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Right, right."
19116,A x Hard x Master.,63,"We already have a master, and we don't need anyone else to teach us."
19117,A x Hard x Master.,63,Wing?
19118,A x Hard x Master.,63,You mean that little boy with \Nmessy hair and glasses?
19119,A x Hard x Master.,63,The one who never tucks in his shirt?
19120,A x Hard x Master.,63,Do you know him?
19121,A x Hard x Master.,63,Do I know him?
19122,A x Hard x Master.,63,Wing's one of my students.
19123,A x Hard x Master.,63,Seriously?
19124,A x Hard x Master.,63,That's awesome!
19125,A x Hard x Master.,63,So he's become a master now...
19126,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Time really flies, huh?"
19127,A x Hard x Master.,63,Does that mean you're pro Hunters?
19128,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Oh, just me."
19129,A x Hard x Master.,63,You've passed the secret exam?
19130,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yep.
19131,A x Hard x Master.,63,That really takes me back...
19132,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'd love to serve as an examiner again.
19133,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Well, I'm essentially your master's master, so you shouldn't have any \Nproblems with my teaching you."
19134,A x Hard x Master.,63,A x Hard x Master
19135,A x Hard x Master.,63,Wow!
19136,A x Hard x Master.,63,You've been an examiner!
19137,A x Hard x Master.,63,Assuming that she's telling the truth.
19138,A x Hard x Master.,63,You're a stubborn little boy.
19139,A x Hard x Master.,63,I like to see that in kids.
19140,A x Hard x Master.,63,"You said that you weren't desperate, right?"
19141,A x Hard x Master.,63,Book.
19142,A x Hard x Master.,63,That card...
19143,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Marimo-chi \N\NA super-fast ball-like \Ncreature about as hard \Nas rubber. Deals little \Ndamage, but can be \Nannoying if it smacks \Nyou in the face."
19144,A x Hard x Master.,63,Look carefully.
19145,A x Hard x Master.,63,Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.
19146,A x Hard x Master.,63,It's a normal card that doesn't \Ngo in a restricted slot.
19147,A x Hard x Master.,63,"The problem is that there are many people who \Ncould have effortlessly obtained this card, while you two could not."
19148,A x Hard x Master.,63,If you run into someone who's \Nstronger and has evil intentions...
19149,A x Hard x Master.,63,Sit down... \NPretend that we're chatting.
19150,A x Hard x Master.,63,There's an enemy behind me.
19151,A x Hard x Master.,63,Three kids?
19152,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll cut them apart.
19153,A x Hard x Master.,63,Don't probe for him.
19154,A x Hard x Master.,63,He'll notice.
19155,A x Hard x Master.,63,How did you sense him?
19156,A x Hard x Master.,63,He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.
19157,A x Hard x Master.,63,"The enemy saw a bunch of kids, \Nand he relaxed for a second."
19158,A x Hard x Master.,63,Doesn't that mean he's weak?
19159,A x Hard x Master.,63,He immediately concealed his presence again.
19160,A x Hard x Master.,63,"It was only the slightest bloodlust, \Nand he quickly concealed it, so he's pretty good."
19161,A x Hard x Master.,63,"We couldn't even sense his presence, \Nlet alone locate him."
19162,A x Hard x Master.,63,What should we do?
19163,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's fast on the uptake!
19164,A x Hard x Master.,63,This boy's bright.
19165,A x Hard x Master.,63,What do you think?
19166,A x Hard x Master.,63,We three should move together.
19167,A x Hard x Master.,63,Why do you say that?
19168,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm guessing he decided to use caution because there are three of us.
19169,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If we stick together, \Nhe'll be less eager to attack."
19170,A x Hard x Master.,63,I agree.
19171,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Well, you're right."
19172,A x Hard x Master.,63,But that's not what we're going to do.
19173,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If I go off on my own, the enemy is one hundred percent \Nguaranteed to attack me."
19174,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I'll go south. You boys, go north."
19175,A x Hard x Master.,63,Walk five hundred meters without \Nconcealing your presences.
19176,A x Hard x Master.,63,Aim for that pillar.
19177,A x Hard x Master.,63,Zetsu{\i0
19178,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Okay, stalk the stalker—"
19179,A x Hard x Master.,63,Huh?
19180,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Fine, then! Be that way!"
19181,A x Hard x Master.,63,Damned hag...
19182,A x Hard x Master.,63,I've had enough!
19183,A x Hard x Master.,63,Bye-bye.
19184,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Yeah, get lost!"
19185,A x Hard x Master.,63,We didn't want you around!
19186,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Come on, Gon!"
19187,A x Hard x Master.,63,Let's go.
19188,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Oh, they're acting."
19189,A x Hard x Master.,63,"So long, stupid!"
19190,A x Hard x Master.,63,That woman really is something.
19191,A x Hard x Master.,63,Huh?
19192,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I was on full alert, so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice."
19193,A x Hard x Master.,63,But I didn't realize what she'd done until my cheek began to sting.
19194,A x Hard x Master.,63,Let's hurry back.
19195,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yeah.
19196,A x Hard x Master.,63,I just cut your hair...
19197,A x Hard x Master.,63,With my Scissor Hands!
19198,A x Hard x Master.,63,"When I eat the hair I cut,"
19199,A x Hard x Master.,63,I can learn things about the owner's body that they don't even know about themselves.
19200,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Muscle tone, potential for \Ndisease, genetic strengths!"
19201,A x Hard x Master.,63,I will learn everything about your body before I begin to toy with it...
19202,A x Hard x Master.,63,Age fifty-seven?!
19203,A x Hard x Master.,63,And she looks like this?
19204,A x Hard x Master.,63,What's even scarier is how honed her body is.
19205,A x Hard x Master.,63,I can see her physical appearance conceals the strength she's achieved through intensive training.
19206,A x Hard x Master.,63,My fighter's spirit insists that \NI challenge you to a duel.
19207,A x Hard x Master.,63,I guess you aren't a total deviant.
19208,A x Hard x Master.,63,Very well.
19209,A x Hard x Master.,63,You're lucky.
19210,A x Hard x Master.,63,Nen{\i0
19211,A x Hard x Master.,63,"During that battle, what did you see first?"
19212,A x Hard x Master.,63,The guy being flipped through the air.
19213,A x Hard x Master.,63,Same here.
19214,A x Hard x Master.,63,Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.
19215,A x Hard x Master.,63,She's just that strong!
19216,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If he were an in-game character, he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty."
19217,A x Hard x Master.,63,It would have been an instant \Ngame over for you boys.
19218,A x Hard x Master.,63,That makes the second time
19219,A x Hard x Master.,63,I've seen you barely escape death.
19220,A x Hard x Master.,63,How long will your good fortune last?
19221,A x Hard x Master.,63,Bisky-san...
19222,A x Hard x Master.,63,Just call me Bisky.
19223,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If you insist on an honorific, call me Bisky-chama!"
19224,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll just call you Hag.
19225,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Why are you here, Bisky?"
19226,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Well, I'm here to clear the game, but I'm mainly after a jewel."
19227,A x Hard x Master.,63,A jewel?
19228,A x Hard x Master.,63,There's a jewel that can only be found here.
19229,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Blue Planet \N\NA gemstone with an \Nincomparable blue shine. \NIts composition matches \Nno known minerals, \Nso it's named for its \Notherworldly nature."
19230,A x Hard x Master.,63,It goes in restricted slot #81...
19231,A x Hard x Master.,63,Blue Planet.
19232,A x Hard x Master.,63,What about you boys?
19233,A x Hard x Master.,63,"We're here to clear the game, obviously."
19234,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Actually, my dad made this game."
19235,A x Hard x Master.,63,Oh?
19236,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I'm looking for my dad, so I thought this game might contain a lead."
19237,A x Hard x Master.,63,Who's your dad?
19238,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ging Freecss.
19239,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ging?!
19240,A x Hard x Master.,63,You know him?
19241,A x Hard x Master.,63,You bet I do!
19242,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's famous.
19243,A x Hard x Master.,63,Chairman Netero once said
19244,A x Hard x Master.,63,Nen{\i0
19245,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Bisky, if you'd be willing to \Npostpone your treasure hunt,"
19246,A x Hard x Master.,63,Nen{\i0
19247,A x Hard x Master.,63,You've finally come around?
19248,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm a lot tougher than Wing.
19249,A x Hard x Master.,63,Are you ready?
19250,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yes!
19251,A x Hard x Master.,63,What about you?
19252,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll be fine.
19253,A x Hard x Master.,63,Take out all your cards.
19254,A x Hard x Master.,63,Book.
19255,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm going to give you a chance.
19256,A x Hard x Master.,63,You must evade their attacks for two weeks!
19257,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If you're successful, I'll let you escape."
19258,A x Hard x Master.,63,If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...
19259,A x Hard x Master.,63,I will kill you.
19260,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I just have to avoid their attacks, right?"
19261,A x Hard x Master.,63,It doesn't matter what I do to them?
19262,A x Hard x Master.,63,Sure.
19263,A x Hard x Master.,63,But there's one rule.
19264,A x Hard x Master.,63,You aren't allowed to leave this crater.
19265,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If you break this rule, you lose, and I'll kill you."
19266,A x Hard x Master.,63,What about us?
19267,A x Hard x Master.,63,The same rules apply.
19268,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If you leave, or fail to defeat \Nhim after two weeks, you'll be punished."
19269,A x Hard x Master.,63,"You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?"
19270,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yeah.
19271,A x Hard x Master.,63,"There's a bounty on his head, as well."
19272,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's a brutal murderer.
19273,A x Hard x Master.,63,Begin!
19274,A x Hard x Master.,63,Why are you standing around?
19275,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's trying to heal up!
19276,A x Hard x Master.,63,Are you going to let him?
19277,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If he weren't injured,"
19278,A x Hard x Master.,63,I would have lost my eye!
19279,A x Hard x Master.,63,We can't get close to him...
19280,A x Hard x Master.,63,Should I use this?
19281,A x Hard x Master.,63,"But while I charge up, he won't stay still."
19282,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition."
19283,A x Hard x Master.,63,Attrition?
19284,A x Hard x Master.,63,You get some rest.
19285,A x Hard x Master.,63,"I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack."
19286,A x Hard x Master.,63,We'll switch every six hours.
19287,A x Hard x Master.,63,Rocks?
19288,A x Hard x Master.,63,That's a good idea.
19289,A x Hard x Master.,63,That's exactly what I need...
19290,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If I can rest like this for a week, \NI'll be more or less recovered."
19291,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Once I'm healed, I can finish them off."
19292,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's using the rock as a shield!
19293,A x Hard x Master.,63,Correct!
19294,A x Hard x Master.,63,You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.
19295,A x Hard x Master.,63,Makes sense.
19296,A x Hard x Master.,63,Damn!
19297,A x Hard x Master.,63,They have too much stamina!
19298,A x Hard x Master.,63,I won't have any time to rest!
19299,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Binolt may be injured, but making him uncomfortable \Nin half a day is still impressive."
19300,A x Hard x Master.,63,They're conscious that their lives \Nare on the line in this fight.
19301,A x Hard x Master.,63,Not bad at all.
19302,A x Hard x Master.,63,These boys are raw gems!
19303,A x Hard x Master.,63,That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.
19304,A x Hard x Master.,63,"That hidden, bottomless potential."
19305,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If properly cut through training, \Nhe can be completely transformed..."
19306,A x Hard x Master.,63,Like a diamond!
19307,A x Hard x Master.,63,"And this boy is a cool, calm blue."
19308,A x Hard x Master.,63,"He may look fragile, but with the right amount of heat, he can \Nachieve semi-permanent strength..."
19309,A x Hard x Master.,63,Like a sapphire!
19310,A x Hard x Master.,63,Why does my heart skip whenever I see something \Nwaiting to be polished?
19311,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll train them well!
19312,A x Hard x Master.,63,What?
19313,A x Hard x Master.,63,A forest of rocks.
19314,A x Hard x Master.,63,"It impedes their enemy, \Nwhile concealing their presences."
19315,A x Hard x Master.,63,This won't take two weeks. \NThey'll finish it in a day.
19316,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Game over, pops!"
19317,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Stop, Killua!"
19318,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Why did you stop me, Gon?"
19319,A x Hard x Master.,63,We still have plenty of time.
19320,A x Hard x Master.,63,Let's continue until we're both \Nable to take him alone.
19321,A x Hard x Master.,63,Huh?
19322,A x Hard x Master.,63,Stopping now would be a waste.
19323,A x Hard x Master.,63,Because we're on a roll.
19324,A x Hard x Master.,63,Fool...
19325,A x Hard x Master.,63,It's my turn.
19326,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll slice you up!
19327,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow."
19328,A x Hard x Master.,63,You should get some rest.
19329,A x Hard x Master.,63,You've been slowing down.
19330,A x Hard x Master.,63,True.
19331,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If it takes both of us to beat a single \Ninjured, exhausted man, we won't stand a chance \Nagainst any of the rest."
19332,A x Hard x Master.,63,You won't be able to fool their \Nacute antennae now.
19333,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Binolt, your potential pales \Nin comparison to theirs."
19334,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Oh, my wallet's missing."
19335,A x Hard x Master.,63,Really? You had it a moment ago.
19336,A x Hard x Master.,63,Excuse me...
19337,A x Hard x Master.,63,You dropped this...
19338,A x Hard x Master.,63,Day two...
19339,A x Hard x Master.,63,He's slowing down.
19340,A x Hard x Master.,63,"No, we're getting faster."
19341,A x Hard x Master.,63,Practice pays off that much more when you're fighting an equal for your life.
19342,A x Hard x Master.,63,Damn...
19343,A x Hard x Master.,63,Damn!
19344,A x Hard x Master.,63,I never...
19345,A x Hard x Master.,63,I never wanted to live this way!
19346,A x Hard x Master.,63,That's why I was against this!
19347,A x Hard x Master.,63,You're the one who said \Nthis would be a shortcut.
19348,A x Hard x Master.,63,Now it's my fault?
19349,A x Hard x Master.,63,Look at my clothes... \NThey're dirty now.
19350,A x Hard x Master.,63,I wasn't looking for a reward...
19351,A x Hard x Master.,63,I wasn't expecting any gratitude...
19352,A x Hard x Master.,63,I just...
19353,A x Hard x Master.,63,That's enough.
19354,A x Hard x Master.,63,There's no way I can defeat you.
19355,A x Hard x Master.,63,Kill me.
19356,A x Hard x Master.,63,Why? We won't kill you.
19357,A x Hard x Master.,63,You've helped us make a lot of progress.
19358,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Thank you, Binolt-san!"
19359,A x Hard x Master.,63,I only wanted to lead a normal life.
19360,A x Hard x Master.,63,Go on.
19361,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Once I leave, I'll turn myself in."
19362,A x Hard x Master.,63,Gon...
19363,A x Hard x Master.,63,"You're flawless, a perfect gem."
19364,A x Hard x Master.,63,But that pure nature could be your undoing.
19365,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Well, let's head for Masadora."
19366,A x Hard x Master.,63,Osu!
19367,A x Hard x Master.,63,The number 9!
19368,A x Hard x Master.,63,Too slow!
19369,A x Hard x Master.,63,Give me three thousand push-ups.
19370,A x Hard x Master.,63,Damn...
19371,A x Hard x Master.,63,Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.
19372,A x Hard x Master.,63,"That's a three-hour trip, at most."
19373,A x Hard x Master.,63,Seriously?
19374,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Oh, there it is!"
19375,A x Hard x Master.,63,City of Magic \NMasadora
19376,A x Hard x Master.,63,Let's find a department store now!
19377,A x Hard x Master.,63,They're only selling cards...
19378,A x Hard x Master.,63,Sorry for the wait.
19379,A x Hard x Master.,63,Let's return to that rocky area.
19380,A x Hard x Master.,63,What?!
19381,A x Hard x Master.,63,Gain!
19382,A x Hard x Master.,63,These are the cards you bought?
19383,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yep.
19384,A x Hard x Master.,63,We'll head back to Masadora now.
19385,A x Hard x Master.,63,"However, we'll go in a straight line!"
19386,A x Hard x Master.,63,Huh? A straight line?
19387,A x Hard x Master.,63,You can't mean...
19388,A x Hard x Master.,63,Yep!
19389,A x Hard x Master.,63,It's time to dig!
19390,A x Hard x Master.,63,The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.
19391,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly."
19392,A x Hard x Master.,63,This is rough...
19393,A x Hard x Master.,63,No more...
19394,A x Hard x Master.,63,Hold on.
19395,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If you're going to rest, sit properly."
19396,A x Hard x Master.,63,Huh?
19397,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Starting today, you must always \Nsleep in this position."
19398,A x Hard x Master.,63,Don't let go of the rope.
19399,A x Hard x Master.,63,"There's a chance I might cut the rope, so keep a portion of your \Nbrain alert while you sleep."
19400,A x Hard x Master.,63,My old man put me through this \Nkind of training all the time.
19401,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ow!
19402,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Okay, when it falls, \Nyou have to put it back up."
19403,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Gon, your head..."
19404,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm good...
19405,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'll be making them bigger.
19406,A x Hard x Master.,63,Gon...
19407,A x Hard x Master.,63,I'm good!
19408,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ow!
19409,A x Hard x Master.,63,We've run into a really hard rock.
19410,A x Hard x Master.,63,Can we dig it up?
19411,A x Hard x Master.,63,I don't think a shovel will work.
19412,A x Hard x Master.,63,Nen{\i0
19413,A x Hard x Master.,63,What's wrong?
19414,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Killua, what were you doing with \Nyour aura while digging?"
19415,A x Hard x Master.,63,I wasn't doing anything unusual.
19416,A x Hard x Master.,63,Think of the shovel as part of your body!
19417,A x Hard x Master.,63,I see.
19418,A x Hard x Master.,63,"If we shroud the shovel in aura, \Nour digging will be stronger!"
19419,A x Hard x Master.,63,Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!
19420,A x Hard x Master.,63,Okay! Let's keep on digging!
19421,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ten{\i1
19422,A x Hard x Master.,63,Surround
19423,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Once we reach Masadora, \Nthey'll have completed the first stage."
19424,A x Hard x Master.,63,How will Bisky's grueling training \Ntransform the two boys?
19425,A x Hard x Master.,63,G.I. Tutorial
19426,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
19427,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet."
19428,A x Hard x Master.,63,"Blue Planet \N\NA gemstone with an \Nincomparable blue shine. \NIts composition matches \Nno known minerals, \Nso it's named for its \Notherworldly nature."
19429,A x Hard x Master.,63,It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.
19430,A x Hard x Master.,63,She's going through all this just for a stone?
19431,A x Hard x Master.,63,That hag has weird taste...
19432,A x Hard x Master.,63,Continue!
19433,A x Hard x Master.,63,Next time: Strengthen x And x Threaten.
19434,A x Hard x Master.,63,Strengthen!
19435,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ahem!
19436,A x Hard x Master.,63,Don't threaten!
19437,A x Hard x Master.,63,Ahem!
19438,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,All right!
19439,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We made it through!
19440,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Good work!
19441,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I think we've gone five kilometers today.
19442,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"At first, I thought it would take years, but at this pace..."
19443,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Masadora!
19444,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Take two!
19445,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Okay!
19446,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Let's return to the starting point now.
19447,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Again?!
19448,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Strengthen x And x Threaten
19449,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards."
19450,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You have the requisite physical strength \Nto defeat every enemy here.
19451,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What you lack is the ability to come up with \Na plan of attack as you fight.
19452,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"In other words, the ability to strategize."
19453,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The ability to...
19454,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,...strategize.
19455,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I'm not going to say a single word, so devise your own means \Nto defeat the monsters."
19456,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Still, the people who made this \Ngame really were special..."
19457,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The game's programmed in such a way that you're guaranteed to get \Nstronger as you progress.
19458,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"And, most likely, all for the purpose of making him stronger."
19459,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Yes!
19460,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I got the Marimo-chi!
19461,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Nen{\i1
19462,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The ability to think on your feet is the most critical technique.
19463,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"First, get used to thinking all the time, until your thinking is tied to your reflexes."
19464,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This game is a training program \Nto help you achieve that.
19465,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The hardest monster in this \Narea is the Bubble Horse.
19466,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If they clear that hurdle, they'll complete the second stage!"
19467,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Zetsu!
19468,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Caught it!
19469,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I got a Bubble Horse!
19470,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Way to go.
19471,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Yep!
19472,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"When it comes to analysis and \Nphysical strength, Killua's stronger."
19473,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,But Gon makes up for it with his \Nconcentration and recovery speed.
19474,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,They make a perfect team!
19475,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Okay, we'll now begin to \Nwork on your defense."
19476,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Is that...
19477,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"That's right, Gon."
19478,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This is the technique you've been using.
19479,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ten
19480,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu{\i0"
19481,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Zetsu
19482,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ren
19483,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Hatsu
19484,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Gyo are combined in this technique.
19485,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko!
19486,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko
19487,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"You focus all of your aura into one \Npart of your body, then attack."
19488,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This gives it far greater power \Nthan your regular attacks.
19489,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I'm going to attack with my fist.
19490,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You must block my attacks.
19491,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You may not dodge.
19492,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You've figured it out?
19493,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's right...
19494,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If you use your aura to block normally, you'll take considerable damage."
19495,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,So what should you do?
19496,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19497,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You're half right.
19498,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19499,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Nen{\i0 you'll escape unscratched.
19500,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,However...
19501,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0 you'll be destroyed.
19502,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19503,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Though it's contradictory.
19504,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Exactly.
19505,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ten{\i0
19506,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0
19507,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken
19508,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You defend yourself by shrouding your body in \Nmuch more aura than usual.
19509,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19510,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ren{\i0
19511,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0
19512,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Now protect yourself from my punch!
19513,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,So slow.
19514,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You must have relaxed when you \Nsaw how slowly I was moving.
19515,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0
19516,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19517,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"When I add the speed and power \Npacked by a normal punch, it becomes many times stronger."
19518,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Even dozens of times stronger.
19519,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I'll start by going slowly, \Nbut you won't get any warning."
19520,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0
19521,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Gon!
19522,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Hmm, that was almost two minutes..."
19523,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I had no idea it could be this \Nhard to keep up my {\i0
19524,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0 or you won't stand a chance.
19525,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Okay, we're through!"
19526,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0
19527,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Good, that was thirty minutes!"
19528,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Over the past month, \Nyou've become a lot tougher."
19529,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The number 3!
19530,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Bingo!
19531,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Killua was slightly faster.
19532,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Gon, give me a thousand push-ups."
19533,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Okay, we'll begin actual \Ncombat training today."
19534,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken!
19535,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"In your current state, your attack \Npower is 50, defense 50."
19536,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ken{\i0 you won't be able to deal much damage.
19537,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What should you do?
19538,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19539,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You fool.
19540,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ko{\i0
19541,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Gyo{\i0
19542,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Correct!
19543,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"From your current 50-50 state, at the moment of attack, you shift your fist to 70 POW, and the rest to 30 POW."
19544,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Gyo{\i0
19545,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ryu{\i0
19546,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ryu
19547,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Let's get started...
19548,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Right hand to 70 POW, \Nrest of your body to 30 POW!"
19549,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out."
19550,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Left leg to 80 POW, \Nrest of your body to 20 POW!"
19551,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Head to 60 POW, \Nrest of your body to 40 POW!"
19552,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day."
19553,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Add it to your current training menu.
19554,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Also...
19555,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We'll begin sparring now.
19556,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Ryu{\i0
19557,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"When you're on the defensive, \Ndetermine your opponent's attack power"
19558,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64, Ryu{\i0
19559,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,With that said...
19560,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Begin!
19561,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I'll go first, then."
19562,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Right leg, 55 POW."
19563,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Right leg, 60 POW, I think..."
19564,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Left hand, 60 POW."
19565,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Right fist, 80 POW!"
19566,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Left elbow, 80 POW!"
19567,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If they keep this up daily, for two months, they'll be able to fight at \Nfull speed while using {\i0"
19568,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"After that, it'll be time for the final stage."
19569,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Okay!
19570,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Time for a break!
19571,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Thank you very much!
19572,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Osu!
19573,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,It's been two weeks.
19574,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,They've made a lot of progress...
19575,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,It appears you're ready for the final stage.
19576,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The final stage?
19577,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Yes, you will begin training in \Nthe individual categories."
19578,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,3!
19579,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Bingo!
19580,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,A draw.
19581,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You're free to train solely in your own category.
19582,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,In the case of an Enhancer...
19583,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Enhancer
19584,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.
19585,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills, while training the nearby categories of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion."
19586,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Then you'll master your own category faster.
19587,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,9!
19588,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Bingo!
19589,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,A draw.
19590,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Good job, Killua."
19591,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Same to you.
19592,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Then, let's get started."
19593,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Osu!
19594,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Today, we'll be training in \Nthe Enhancer category."
19595,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Level 1 is smashing rocks.
19596,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Crush them like this.
19597,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Smash a thousand with a single stone \Nin a day, and you clear the level."
19598,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,And begin!
19599,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This is pretty tough.
19600,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,All I'm doing is changing the stone to 100 POW \Nat the moment of impact.
19601,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,But my{\i0
19602,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Oops, it crumbled..."
19603,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over."
19604,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Damn!
19605,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Damn, I failed!"
19606,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What are you talking about? \NYou did well.
19607,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Okay!
19608,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Let's do Transmuter training next.
19609,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Now, now, don't rush."
19610,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You're only allowed to train \None category per day.
19611,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,6!
19612,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Bingo! A draw.
19613,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Again?
19614,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"These days, we keep getting draws."
19615,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Gyo{\i0
19616,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"But if there's no winner, it's no fun."
19617,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Okay, then we'll decide \Nwith rock-paper-scissors."
19618,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The loser does a thousand push-ups!
19619,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Sure.
19620,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,First comes rock...
19621,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Rock, paper, scissors!"
19622,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,One more time!
19623,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I win!
19624,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Damn!
19625,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Hey, boys..."
19626,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Have you heard the theory that \Nrock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?
19627,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Huh?
19628,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Palm
19629,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Paper represents a palm attack that \Nwrecks the opponent's organs.
19630,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Fingers
19631,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Scissors represents a finger jab, \Ntargeting vital points."
19632,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Fist
19633,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,And rock represents a punch with \Nthe fist to deal external damage.
19634,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Evil Fist
19635,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken as purely destructive and banned as an evil art, martial artists trained by playing this game."
19636,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.
19637,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You really are old...
19638,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's it!
19639,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Eh?
19640,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Evil Fist.
19641,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Now, everyone."
19642,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We have a total of 133 cards from \N90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.
19643,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This is the product of your hard work.
19644,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You have our thanks.
19645,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7."
19646,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,They're as good as ours.
19647,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained an equal number of restricted slot cards."
19648,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The final hurdle will likely be a \Nshowdown against their group.
19649,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"But I believe we have more, \Nand better, spell cards!"
19650,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Gentlemen, our victory is near!"
19651,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Can I say something?
19652,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"These five years have been \Nso long, yet so short..."
19653,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,There's something I must tell you.
19654,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I am the Bomber.
19655,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What? The Bomber?
19656,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"H-Hey, what are you talking about?"
19657,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Now, now... Hear me out."
19658,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I've placed bombs on all of you.
19659,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What was that?
19660,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,How did you do that?!
19661,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Don't mess with us!
19662,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Stay calm and listen.
19663,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Good grief.
19664,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You ruined the explanation I'd planned.
19665,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This is my power...
19666,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Little Flower.
19667,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Fistful of Gunpowder \NLittle Flower
19668,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"As you just saw,"
19669,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.
19670,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,But it isn't very strong.
19671,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,He's still alive.
19672,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"However, if the bombs on your bodies explode, you will die."
19673,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,A bomb? Where is it?
19674,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.
19675,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Let's start with how I set them.
19676,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"That was by touching the place on \Nthe target I wanted to explode, and saying a certain keyword."
19677,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The keyword is
19678,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"""Bomber."""
19679,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,It was the Bomber again.
19680,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Listen... Beware of the Bomber.
19681,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"In order to disarm the bombs, you must touch my body and say, \N""I caught the Bomber."""
19682,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"However, I also have the Little Flower ability."
19683,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I can use this to stop anyone \Nwho tries to touch me.
19684,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You must be very careful as you \Nattempt to disarm the bombs.
19685,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's all.
19686,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,They're armed.
19687,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This is the ability Countdown.
19688,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Sound of Life\NCountdown
19689,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Why am I telling you so \Nmuch about my powers?
19690,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's the condition for arming the bombs.
19691,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Then you've been waiting for \Nthe day when all the cards and members were gathered.
19692,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Now, I have a proposition."
19693,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I will trade your lives for those \N90 restricted slot cards.
19694,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If you agree, I will use an alternative method, and simultaneously disarm all the bombs."
19695,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Do nothing, and all of you will die \Nwhen the counter reaches zero."
19696,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You should discuss this amongst yourselves.
19697,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I'll be waiting for you at \NMr. Battera's old mansion.
19698,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I don't care who comes, but come alone."
19699,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Are you insane?
19700,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If we just catch you now and \Ndisarm the bombs, it's all over."
19701,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Do you think you can escape alone?!
19702,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Calm yourselves...
19703,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If you get too excited, \Nthe countdown will accelerate."
19704,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Because the counter is linked \Nto your heartbeat.
19705,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What?
19706,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Book!
19707,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Crap!
19708,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I pray we meet again!
19709,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Leave \N\NSend one target player \Noff the island. \N\N[SR][NORM]
19710,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Leave on!
19711,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,He escaped outside the game!
19712,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We have to follow him...
19713,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Wait!
19714,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If we leave, the cards inside \Nour binders will vanish!"
19715,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Then what do we do?
19716,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Calm down!
19717,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,It would be unwise to chase him down!
19718,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Have you forgotten why we teamed up?
19719,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Because we aren't strong fighters!
19720,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Does anyone here think they're \Nstrong enough to defeat him?
19721,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,It would be impossible.
19722,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Nen{\i0
19723,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If all of us attacked him together, he could use Little Flower to defeat us all."
19724,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Damn, we were so close!"
19725,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"First, we must reach a consensus."
19726,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Do we hand over the cards?
19727,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Or do we fight?
19728,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Please give him the cards...
19729,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I beg you.
19730,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Jispa's running out of time...
19731,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's a surprise.
19732,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I was expecting Nickes to come.
19733,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I'm surprised, too."
19734,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I didn't expect you to be alone...
19735,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Sub and Bara.
19736,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,They're the other bombers.
19737,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Now give me your ring.
19738,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What's wrong?
19739,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I can't turn it over yet...
19740,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Actually, we still haven't reached a decision."
19741,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,And Nickes has requested the Breath \Nof Archangel card to save Jispa.
19742,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Screw that!
19743,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"As it stands, neither side can win this!"
19744,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Eh?
19745,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You don't realize how hysterical they are.
19746,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If they can't make a decision before \Ntime expires and they explode, you'll lose the data in their rings!"
19747,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,But I can—
19748,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,But you can convince them?
19749,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Are you trying to bargain with me?
19750,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"When striking a bargain, you have to demonstrate just \Nhow calm and insane you are."
19751,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,W-Wait...
19752,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,If you kill me...
19753,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Don't worry.
19754,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If you kill a player outside the \Ngame and take their ring, the restricted slot data will not vanish."
19755,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Well, I doubt you have any of the cards."
19756,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,A gift.
19757,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Puhat!
19758,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You won't get another chance.
19759,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Okay?
19760,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Leave...
19761,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,The spell card! Leave!
19762,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"I need to exit, so give it to me."
19763,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Hell, no!"
19764,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Leave is a valuable card.
19765,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We can't waste any!
19766,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Okay, then..."
19767,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If I don't return, it won't be possible to disarm all \Nyour bombs simultaneously."
19768,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,What?
19769,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I'm also a bomber.
19770,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,There are three of us.
19771,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Well, Genthru's the main one, and we're just extras."
19772,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"When the three of us join our \Nright thumbs and say the keyword, the bombs will be destroyed."
19773,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's the alternative method.
19774,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Whatever...
19775,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,I'll take my time returning \Nvia normal means.
19776,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,You guys will be dead soon.
19777,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Wait! Hold on!
19778,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Please use this.
19779,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"You should have done that \Nin the first place, scum!"
19780,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,We'll need Leave cards \Nwhen the deal is made.
19781,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Have three ready.
19782,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Got it?
19783,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Twelve hours before Genthru \Nrevealed himself as the Bomber, a single boat attempted to \Ninvade from the outside."
19784,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,So it does exist in the real world.
19785,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's gotta be Greed Island.
19786,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,G.I. Tutorial
19787,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
19788,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Today, we introduce the card Leave."
19789,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Leave \N\NSend one target player \Noff the island. \N\N[SR][NORM]
19790,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,This takes us back to the real world?
19791,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,That's nice.
19792,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"If you're going out, leave the free slot cards."
19793,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Stupid onliner!
19794,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Huh?
19795,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Continue!
19796,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,Next time: Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.
19797,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,See ya here next week!
19798,Strengthen x And x Threaten.,64,"Rock, paper, scissors!"
19799,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"So, then..."
19800,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Where are we on the island?
19801,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Let's steal an Accompany card and go.
19802,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Uninvited guests?
19803,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'm getting nervous...
19804,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Just so we're clear, you didn't wash up on shore, right?"
19805,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"After all, if you'd let the waves carry you, it would be impossible to reach this island."
19806,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,This guy's strong.
19807,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Who are you?
19808,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Are you supposed to be our tour guide?
19809,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'm one of the designers of this game.
19810,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The name's Razor.
19811,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"I mainly handle the Emitter spells, including all movement via spells and dealing with external threats."
19812,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Eliminate \N\NSend all trespassers \Non Greed Island to a \Nrandom location on \Nthe Azian continent \N\N[LR][SP]
19813,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.
19814,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Sorry, but you'll have to leave."
19815,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're more than welcome to \Nvisit via official channels.
19816,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"From there, if you defeat me, \Nyou can receive an item."
19817,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Should you decide to play, we'll probably get to fight eventually."
19818,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Sounds good...
19819,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We'll come back.
19820,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Through the front door.
19821,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Eliminate on.
19822,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Nen{\i0
19823,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors
19824,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"As Gon continues to train, he discovers a hint to developing \Na new technique, and that is..."
19825,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,First comes rock!
19826,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Rock... Paper...
19827,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Rock!
19828,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I see.
19829,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Here comes the next one!
19830,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,First comes rock!
19831,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Rock... Paper...
19832,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Paper!
19833,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Nen{\i0
19834,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Train more!
19835,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,So paper is an Emitter technique?
19836,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Uh-huh.
19837,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.
19838,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I wanna be able to cut through rock.
19839,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I understand.
19840,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That's a reasonable fighting technique.
19841,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But such a childish idea.
19842,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Nen{\i0
19843,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I was trying to think of a good \Nway to spend that time.
19844,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"And when you were talking about \Nrock-paper-scissors, it hit me."
19845,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Because I like rock-paper-scissors.
19846,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Trusting your instincts is important.
19847,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Your gut plays a big role in \Ntechniques that require
19848,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Nen{\i0
19849,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The key is that it should feel right to you.
19850,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Ah... Ahem.
19851,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, this is all I can manage right now, but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong."
19852,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"That's awesome, Killua!"
19853,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're like an electric eel!
19854,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That's a horrible comparison!
19855,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,He can already change {\i0
19856,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Frightening...
19857,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,And very tragic...
19858,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,His childhood must have been a living hell.
19859,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,It's a miracle that he can smile now.
19860,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Indeed...
19861,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,They make a great team.
19862,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, let's take a break, then."
19863,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"It's a little early, but we can have a party."
19864,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,A party?
19865,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What do you boys do back home to celebrate?
19866,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Celebrate?
19867,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"In the outside world, it's almost New Year's."
19868,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Time flows at the same speed \Ninside the game as outside.
19869,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Oops!
19870,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The deadline to apply for the \NHunter Exam is coming up!
19871,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,And our training was just starting to get fun...
19872,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I believe you're required to apply \Nbefore the end of the year.
19873,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We need to hurry.
19874,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,How do we get outside?
19875,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'm guessing there are spell \Ncards to leave the game?
19876,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"In that case, let's head to Masadora."
19877,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Agreed!
19878,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, let's find a place to have a drink."
19879,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We can't... There's no time.
19880,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We can ask around the stores.
19881,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,How to leave the island?
19882,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"That'll be 3,000 Jenny."
19883,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If you go about fifty kilometers west, you'll reach the island's only port."
19884,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You must defeat or bribe \Nthe chief of that port to receive a ticket that will \Ntransport you outside.
19885,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,How big of a bribe are we talking?
19886,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Depends on how the chief's feeling.
19887,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Ah...
19888,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Your other option is to \Nuse a Leave spell card, but that's a rare one."
19889,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What do we do?
19890,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Let's head for the port.
19891,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If it's a rare card, we could buy \Na bunch without finding one."
19892,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,True.
19893,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Passage Ticket
19894,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Voilà.
19895,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, I'll go pass the test real \Nquick, and then hurry back."
19896,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,There are monsters called Kiriko \Nthat live beneath a cedar tree on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.
19897,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If you tell them you're my friend, they'll take you to the exam area."
19898,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Okay.
19899,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,See ya.
19900,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Then let's get back to training.
19901,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Osu!
19902,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Welcome.
19903,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Is this where I started?
19904,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"No, it's not..."
19905,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"The girl looks similar, though."
19906,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, that's not so unusual in games."
19907,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"You are leaving the island, right?"
19908,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Please select a destination.
19909,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Do you know Dolle Harbor?
19910,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Yes, I do."
19911,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Then send me there.
19912,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Understood.
19913,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"When you leave this island, the cards in your free slots will disappear."
19914,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Is that okay?
19915,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Yeah, it's fine."
19916,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Then we shall await your return.
19917,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'm back in the real world now?
19918,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Doesn't feel that way.
19919,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Book.
19920,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Oh, it doesn't work out here."
19921,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Once I submit my application, \NI'll head for that cedar tree."
19922,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"First, I should shower and \Nchange into fresh clothes."
19923,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Okay, train while you run!"
19924,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9 \Nin one minute, you'll clear this stage."
19925,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That hurt!
19926,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What are you doing?
19927,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Aren't you...
19928,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Your other friend isn't here?
19929,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What's that machine on your shoulder?
19930,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Did something happen?
19931,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We were fooled by the Bomber.
19932,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Will you listen to my story?
19933,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,So he was the Bomber...
19934,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The others are waiting at our base for \Nthe Bomber to disarm the bombs.
19935,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"They believe the terms he gave them, even though it was probably a bluff."
19936,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Can't anything be done?
19937,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,If they're prepared to accept casualties...
19938,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,It's impossible.
19939,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The first people to attack \Nwill be the ones who die.
19940,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Who would volunteer for that role?
19941,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,True...
19942,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Jispa was our group's strongest fighter, and he was defeated in an instant."
19943,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"At that point, our loss was assured."
19944,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,And allowing him to leave the game was a fatal mistake.
19945,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We indulged in a moment's victory cheer before we could verify each \Nmember's cards and assign roles.
19946,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That's when he caught us off guard.
19947,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"It's embarrassing to admit, but I was so distracted, \NI didn't notice him using Leave until it was already too late."
19948,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You were probably focused on \Nunderstanding his explanation.
19949,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Yeah.
19950,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We were thrust into that \Nsituation with no warning.
19951,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Given our mental state, there was \Nno action we could have taken."
19952,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But why are you telling us this?
19953,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Because, of everyone I've met on this island, you are the ones I believe I can most rely on."
19954,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If you run into any other players, please tell them about the Bomber."
19955,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Once everyone knows how his ability works, they should be able to protect themselves."
19956,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"And if possible, I would \Nlike you to avenge us!"
19957,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If not, could you at least promise that \Nyou won't let him clear the game?"
19958,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Yeah.
19959,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Understood.
19960,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Sorry...
19961,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll use what time I have remaining to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.
19962,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Book.
19963,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Return on.
19964,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Bunzen!
19965,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Just kidding...
19966,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The truth is that they were \Nthe only players I could find using Magnetic Force.
19967,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Even a pig can climb a tree if \Nyou give it enough praise.
19968,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Every thousandth of a percent counts when it comes to deactivating someone's {\i0
19969,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, Nickes probably left to \Nmeet with the bombers."
19970,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,If the mass disarmament turns out to be a mass explosion...
19971,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I should get started.
19972,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're finally here.
19973,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Now give me your ring.
19974,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Jispa's dead.
19975,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That's nice. Your ring.
19976,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Disarm everyone's bombs first!
19977,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hell, no."
19978,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"I have to enter the game with your ring, and confirm that the cards \Nreally are all inside."
19979,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll disarm the bombs after that.
19980,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll give you one more chance.
19981,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Hand over the ring.
19982,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Sub, put it on."
19983,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If you put on a second ring outside the game, you'll overwrite the data."
19984,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Now, let's head back inside together."
19985,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Wait, what was your name?"
19986,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Migamura, Samingadura,"
19987,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Interaminga, Zenberarubura."
19988,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Spirits of the forest, remove the tainted{\i0"
19989,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Now, then..."
19990,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What horrors will come of this?
19991,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"I borrow power from the forest spirits, to use my Conjurer ability to create a{\i0"
19992,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,It's huge!
19993,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The Bomber's Countdown must be \Na particularly strong technique.
19994,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,How'd it go?
19995,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Has he disarmed the bombs yet?
19996,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Book.
19997,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,81 restricted slot card types.
19998,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"They're all here, all right."
19999,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We did as you requested...
20000,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Disarm the bombs!
20001,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But of course.
20002,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'm a man of my word.
20003,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"But first, hand over three Leave cards."
20004,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Okay, we have a deal."
20005,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Sub... Bara...
20006,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Let's do this.
20007,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Release.
20008,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I released you from your terror.
20009,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Th-That wasn't the deal...
20010,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Why should I keep a promise
20011,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I made to a bunch of scum?
20012,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Release was the signal to explode, not disarm."
20013,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Leave on!
20014,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"At least now, I don't have \Nto worry about exploding."
20015,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies, this thing won't disappear."
20016,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I have a troublesome partner now...
20017,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hey, stop moving!"
20018,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The Bomber thinks he killed us all.
20019,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll let him believe that...
20020,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Until I make my move!
20021,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Bisky...
20022,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I think we should drop by \Ntheir base real fast.
20023,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,They already ran out of time.
20024,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Besides, he didn't even \Ntell us exactly where it is."
20025,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"And even if we did know, we don't have a spell card \Nthat could take us there."
20026,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I know.
20027,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But some of them might have \Nsurvived the explosion...
20028,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Doubt it.
20029,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs \Non all his targets without anyone noticing, he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake."
20030,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,However...
20031,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"If we continue to play this game, we'll probably run into the Bomber."
20032,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Given that, we may need \Nto visit their base soon."
20033,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Uh-huh.
20034,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We need spell cards.
20035,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Let's go to Masadora and \Nsell our monster cards to buy spell cards.
20036,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Yeah!
20037,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hey, Bisky..."
20038,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,How long do you think it'll take me \Nto master my special technique?
20039,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Nen{\i0
20040,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,It's hard to predict when your \Npower and speed will peak.
20041,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Oh...
20042,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But it shouldn't take too long before you get the form down.
20043,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Really? How long?
20044,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Let's see...
20045,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hopefully, you'll have it ready \Nby the time Killua returns."
20046,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,All right!
20047,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll finish my technique and surprise him!
20048,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You two are lucky!
20049,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We just received a huge \Nshipment of spell cards.
20050,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,These are the spell cards they'd gathered.
20051,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"We bought sixty between us, \Nso there are lots of different types."
20052,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Look.
20053,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Prison \N\NAll slotted cards on target \Npage are immune to theft \Nor destruction via spell \Ncard until removed. \N(Only targets pages 1 - 11. \NFree slot pages \Ncannot be targeted.) \N\N[DEF][CONT]
20054,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,An S-rank card...
20055,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,There are only ten in the whole game!
20056,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What do you think?
20057,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Should we save it?
20058,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Or use it now?
20059,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I don't know what to do!
20060,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Shh!
20061,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're too loud...
20062,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,People will get suspicious!
20063,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,If only Killua were here...
20064,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I can smell Gon on you.
20065,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'd like to see him again...
20066,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,We'll take you to the exam site.
20067,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"I need to zip on over and \Nbreeze through the exam, so I can hurry back to Gon."
20068,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But the exam won't begin for a few days.
20069,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Oh, right."
20070,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"In the meantime, you can tell \Nus about yourself and Gon."
20071,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Okay.
20072,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I'll start with the story about \Nwhen he came to visit my home.
20073,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're making steady progress.
20074,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're on track to have your \Nspecial technique ready.
20075,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,This is a safe place to practice.
20076,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Since we'll be able to spot anyone \Nbefore they're in attack spell range.
20077,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"I can sense people watching from Masadora, just like I sensed people \Nwatching us at the start point."
20078,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But we have plenty of defense spells now.
20079,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Well, just to be safe,"
20080,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I used a Blackout Curtain card.
20081,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Blackout Curtain \N\NBlock one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy. \N(Does not stack when used on target already under \Neffect of Blackout Curtain.) \N\N[DEF][CONT]
20082,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,But no point in worrying about spell cards.
20083,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Just focus on training hard.
20084,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Osu!
20085,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Okay, one minute's up."
20086,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Next.
20087,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,It didn't work.
20088,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,I can't reach it...
20089,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That was just fine.
20090,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're in far better shape than \Na Transmuter would be!
20091,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Be patient, and start by focusing \Non maintaining your aura in a sphere for extended periods of time."
20092,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Osu!
20093,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Ten{\i0
20094,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Once you've trained long enough, you'll be able to maintain an aura \Nsphere for two to three days!"
20095,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You should be able to reach that \Nstone before the day's out.
20096,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,You're right! I reached it!
20097,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,That was fast!
20098,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,This proves he's been hard at work \Non his{\i0
20099,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics."
20100,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Osu!
20101,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Gon continues to train with Bisky, \Nto master his special technique."
20102,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Killua has temporarily left the game \Nto retake the Hunter Exam.
20103,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,The two boys are working \Nhard toward their goals.
20104,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,G.I. Tutorial
20105,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
20106,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Today, we introduce the card Blackout Curtain."
20107,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Blackout Curtain \N\NBlock one instance of enemy Steal \Nor Fluoroscopy. (Does not stack \Nwhen used on target already \Nunder effect of Blackout Curtain.) \N\N[DEF][CONT]
20108,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"With this card, other players can't see inside your binder."
20109,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"You can see inside my binder \Nwhenever you want, Killua."
20110,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,What?!
20111,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Continue!
20112,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,Next time: Strategy x And x Scheme.
20113,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, Gon-kun!"
20114,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, Killua-kun!"
20115,Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors.,65,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, show me what you've got!"
20116,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Once someone comes out, \Nfollow their directions."
20117,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's been fun.
20118,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Good luck.
20119,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Yeah, thank you."
20120,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Is this Mikhail's residence?
20121,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Go do some shopping at \NDick Sakura, by the station."
20122,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"At check out, give the cashier this card."
20123,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Please come this way, sir."
20124,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Strategy x And x Scheme
20125,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There are more people this time.
20126,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I wonder if there's anyone I know.
20127,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Yo.
20128,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Last year, you had your way with us."
20129,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,But that won't happen again.
20130,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We've undergone some hellish training.
20131,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Our teamwork is perfect now.
20132,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Thank you for coming!
20133,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"This year, 1,489 applicants \Nhave made it this far, but the Phase Two examiner has asked me \Nto trim that number to about 300."
20134,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,As for the exam...
20135,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There are two hours before lunch.
20136,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Defeat five people before then.
20137,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Grab their tags when you defeat them, and see me when you have all five."
20138,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I'll wait on the other side of the door.
20139,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Got it?
20140,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"As soon as I shut the door, you may start."
20141,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Every stage of the exam should be like this...
20142,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.
20143,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Oh, you're here!"
20144,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Killu—
20145,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Sucks for you.
20146,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I'm the only one passing this year.
20147,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He's totally out of our league...
20148,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So that's what it takes to \Nbecome a top Hunter...
20149,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This will be the last time I \Nattempt the Hunter Exam...
20150,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We finally have our first applicant.
20151,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That took an hour and a half.
20152,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What happened to everyone else?
20153,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,They're all asleep.
20154,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It took me a while to collect all their tags.
20155,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Is there going to be a second stage?
20156,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That won't be necessary.
20157,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He's demonstrated his skill.
20158,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Killua, denizen of the darkness..."
20159,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He's returned much stronger.
20160,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Applicant 1219, Killua-kun."
20161,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Yeah.
20162,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You've passed the Hunter Exam!
20163,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Welcome back, Killua."
20164,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,How was the exam?
20165,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I passed it in no time, naturally."
20166,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Yay!
20167,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Sorry to interrupt your celebration, \Nbut look at these spell cards."
20168,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Wow...
20169,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There's even an S-rank card!
20170,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,How much can we sell it for?
20171,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Oh, let's go ask around!"
20172,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"No, we should use it wisely."
20173,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So what should we do?
20174,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it."
20175,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"With all these defensive spells, we don't need to worry \Nabout it getting stolen."
20176,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Have you tried any of these?
20177,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Just Blackout Curtain.
20178,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What?
20179,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If you have all these cards, \Nyou should use them..."
20180,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Start by using this one.
20181,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"You can choose a player you've \Nmet before, and talk to them."
20182,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Contact \N\NCommunicate with one target \Nplayer (encountered within the \Ngame) via your Book. \N(Connection maintained for \Na maximum of 3 minutes. \NMay only be broken by \Nplayer who used this card.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
20183,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Who should we talk to?
20184,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We won't know until we see who's available.
20185,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Contact on!
20186,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Oh, I see a lot of names."
20187,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, Gon..."
20188,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,When did you run into him?
20189,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Huh?
20190,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Chrollo Lucilfer
20191,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Chrollo?
20192,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Who's Chrollo?
20193,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.
20194,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Does that mean you guys passed \Neach other without noticing?
20195,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Huh? What are you talking about?
20196,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That doesn't make sense.
20197,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20198,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20199,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Who's Kurapika?!
20200,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That only leaves...
20201,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Let me in on this!
20202,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I get it. So that's what's going on.
20203,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, Shal..."
20204,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Stop laughing, and explain \Nwhat this is about."
20205,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Sorry about that.
20206,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Chrollo Lucilfer
20207,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This probably isn't the boss.
20208,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20209,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20210,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's very doable.
20211,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Seriously?
20212,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Of course!
20213,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20214,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20215,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20216,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Why would he be here?
20217,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I'm not sure, but we should probably let Kurapika know."
20218,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I'll leave the game real quick.
20219,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You can use a spell card to leave.
20220,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Save it.
20221,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I can be out and back in four hours.
20222,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I should have realized this sooner...
20223,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Yorknew City                                        Greed Island
20224,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This island is directly east of Yorknew City.
20225,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,East is the direction to go.
20226,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You will find one who awaits you.
20227,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I see.
20228,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20229,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"The boss arrived the same way we did, but then Razor kicked him out."
20230,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That was when he realized \Nthis was Greed Island.
20231,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0 he can't enter the island \Nvia the usual channels.
20232,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So he must have hired someone \Nto come to this island for him.
20233,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He had them use his name \Nas a hidden message to us.
20234,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20235,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Change in plans again...
20236,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Let's bring everyone else here.
20237,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20238,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I have a small correction.
20239,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You're...
20240,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Hisoka!
20241,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.
20242,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Because I didn't know you could \Nenter any name you like until I was already inside...
20243,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You should praise my initiative.
20244,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.
20245,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Ah, so that's what this is about."
20246,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I'm dying to kill you right here and now, but I'll let the boss do that."
20247,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Well, if anything comes up, \Nuse Contact to get in touch."
20248,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If I learn anything new, I'll let you know."
20249,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Bye.
20250,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So the boss hired Hisoka...
20251,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"He probably didn't have much \Nchoice, but it's still weird."
20252,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"And his reward is probably a duel, \Nonce the boss is cleansed."
20253,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"But now, it's only a matter of time until the boss comes back!"
20254,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I doubt it.
20255,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I would know at once
20256,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20257,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"So when you chose your power, you \Nknew something like this might happen?"
20258,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Of course...
20259,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0 it only makes sense to assume
20260,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Nen{\i0
20261,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Well, now you know."
20262,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What you do from here is up to you.
20263,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Thanks for taking the trouble.
20264,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You have my gratitude.
20265,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Did you need anything?
20266,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What am I...
20267,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What am I supposed to do this month?
20268,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Tell me...
20269,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What should I do?
20270,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It'll be fine. Let me handle...
20271,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What could you possibly know?
20272,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You have no idea what's going \Nto happen to us now!
20273,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Neon... I need Neon!
20274,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Restore Neon at once!
20275,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Damn! Why did this happen?
20276,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I wonder what's wrong...
20277,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Why did it stop working?
20278,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,See ya.
20279,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.
20280,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Oh...
20281,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Kurapika was pretty calm about it.
20282,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.
20283,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Well, it sounds like you \Ngot worried for nothing."
20284,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Now it's time to focus on yourselves.
20285,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Osu!
20286,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Start with the basics...
20287,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We're not going to train.
20288,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's time to start beating this game!
20289,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle lives only on this tree!
20290,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There's only one way to capture it!
20291,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.
20292,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,First comes rock!
20293,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Rock, paper..."
20294,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Rock!
20295,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Wow!
20296,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's raining bugs!
20297,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Found it.
20298,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Difficulty rank A!
20299,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,King Great White Beetle \N\NA legendary insect that \Nreleases pheromones \Nwhich attract other insects \Nto start a massive colony.\NCan only leave the colony \Nfor brief evening walks.
20300,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That's three King Great White Beetle cards!
20301,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You could've gotten more if \Nyou'd thrown a real punch.
20302,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Well, I didn't want to damage the tree."
20303,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There is no such girl in this mansion.
20304,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Even if there were, it would be impossible for you to bypass all the traps and find her."
20305,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Found her.
20306,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"She was in a hidden room, \Nfour floors underground."
20307,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What?
20308,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Curse you!
20309,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!
20310,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Gold Dust Girl \N\NA girl who releases golden dust. \NOne bath a day will net approx. 500 G. \NVery shy and quiet.
20311,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,The guard was a rank F.
20312,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Next, let's head to the \NCity of Gambling, Dorias!"
20313,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Wait, wasn't today supposed to be the monthly contest in Antokiba?"
20314,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go."
20315,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.
20316,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,A Paladin's Necklace! Score!
20317,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Paladin's Necklace \N\NWhen a player wears this, \Nall spells targeting player \Nwill be reflected. \NCan also dispel curses \Nplaced on any card \Ntouched by player."
20318,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I don't understand this description.
20319,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We can ask one of the shopkeepers.
20320,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"When you wear this necklace, you can reflect all attack spells."
20321,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,And if you touch cards under the
20322,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Transform \N\NChange one card in your possession into any \Nother card in your possession. (Card will now \Ncount against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen, \Nand the Transform card will be destroyed.) \N\N[SR][NORM]"
20323,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Fake \N\NChange Fake into any card type from 001 to 099. \NThe new card can be placed in a restricted pocket. \NBut it will not count toward Book completion, \Nand cannot be transformed into an item. \NIt also will not count toward card limit. \N\N[SR][NORM] effects of Transform or Fake, you can restore them to their original state."
20324,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Wow...
20325,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If we wear this, we won't have to \Nworry about losing any cards."
20326,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Memory Helmet...
20327,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Memory Helmet \N\NA player will always remember \Neverything seen or heard \Nwhile wearing this item. \NUnfortunately, helmet is \Nvery large and heavy."
20328,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Witch's Love Potion.
20329,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Witch's Love Potion \N\NIf player kisses a pill before \Nfeeding it to a target, target will \Nbecome beholden to player. \NEach pill will remain effective \Nfor one week. Each bottle \Ncontains 500 pills."
20330,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Risky Dice.
20331,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Risky Dice \N\NA 20-sided die. One side says \NBad Luck, while the other nineteen \Nsay Good Luck. If player rolls \NGood Luck, something good will \Nhappen. But if player rolls Bad Luck, \Nsomething bad will happen to cancel \Nout everything that was good."
20332,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,King Great White Beetle.
20333,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,King Great White Beetle \N\NA legendary insect that \Nreleases pheromones \Nwhich attract other insects \Nto start a massive colony.\NCan only leave the colony \Nfor brief evening walks.
20334,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Gold Dust Girl.
20335,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Gold Dust Girl \N\NA girl who releases golden dust. \NOne bath a day will net approx. 500 G. \NVery shy and quiet.
20336,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Paladin's Necklace \N\NWhen a player wears this, \Nall spells targeting player \Nwill be reflected. \NCan also dispel curses \Nplaced on any card \Ntouched by player."
20337,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Paladin's Necklace.
20338,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,A total of six different restricted slot cards!
20339,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Piece of cake!
20340,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Piece of cake?
20341,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Not in the least.
20342,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This was only possible because you \Nunderwent that grueling training.
20343,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
20344,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Yo. It's been a while, Gon."
20345,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Who are you?
20346,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You don't remember me?
20347,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Do you remember the player who took the Sword of Truth \Nfrom you in Antokiba?
20348,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What do you want?
20349,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Up for a trade?
20350,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I have #66, Witch's Diet Pill, \Nand #17, VIP Multi-Pass."
20351,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You can talk it over with your friends.
20352,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What do you think?
20353,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
20354,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's Tsezgerra.
20355,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You again?
20356,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Interested in trading your
20357,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Breath of Archangel for our Patch of Forest?
20358,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's an SS-rank card.
20359,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,No way.
20360,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I've already said I won't \Ndeal with you people.
20361,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What if I throw in a Clone?
20362,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I'm telling you that there's no deal here.
20363,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You already have ninety-two different cards.
20364,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"All that's left are the cards monopolized \Nby other players, yes?"
20365,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Actually, we have ninety-five..."
20366,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,And you probably have many items \Nthat you haven't used Gain on yet.
20367,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's possible that Breath of Archangel \Nis the final card you need.
20368,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If we give that to you, we'll lose."
20369,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Stop playing dumb.
20370,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I know that you're monopolizing both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade.
20371,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This game isn't over yet.
20372,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I see.
20373,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Good luck, then."
20374,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,But we'll never let you have these cards.
20375,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What if I offer three cards?
20376,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"We'll give you Patch of Forest,"
20377,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Patch of Forest \N\NThe entrance to an enormous \Nforest known as the Mountain \NGod's Garden. Many species \Nexist only in this forest. \NAll are friendly to humans.
20378,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hidden Hollow \N\NUpon entering and exiting hollow, \Nplayer will be transported to a \Ndesolate location. However, player can \Nreturn to original location \Nwithout spending any money."
20379,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hidden Hollow,"
20380,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Palmtop Dragon \N\NAs the name implies, this dragon \Nfits on your palm. Willingly obeys \Nits master. If raised lovingly, \Nit can learn to speak. and Palmtop Dragon."
20381,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"And you only have to give us Night Jade, \Nnot Breath of Archangel."
20382,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"We'd be giving you one SS-rank \Ncard and two S-rank cards, while you'd only give up one A-rank card."
20383,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I believe this deal is too good to pass up.
20384,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Give us some time to discuss this.
20385,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Just to be clear, this is our final offer."
20386,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We won't accept any further negotiation.
20387,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Book.
20388,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's gotta be a trap.
20389,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That offer's too good.
20390,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Tsezgerra is a careful man.
20391,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He wouldn't try to pick a fight.
20392,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"But at the same time, he would \Nnever make a losing deal."
20393,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Breath of Archangel \N\NAn angel who can cure any mortal \Ninjury or terminal disease with one breath. \NHowever, angel will appear only once."
20394,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Meaning that he thinks he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.
20395,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Does that mean they've assembled \Nall forty spell card types?
20396,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's possible.
20397,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So they're waiting for Gain to be \Nused on a Breath of Archangel.
20398,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Night Jade \N\NA jewel blessed by the devil. \NWhen the holder is in danger, \Nperil will be shifted to another."
20399,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"On the other hand, Night Jade is a card that we monopolized through hard work."
20400,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If one of the cards were to be destroyed, one of our jade jewels would \Nautomatically turn into a card."
20401,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Which means the A-rank \NNight Jade is much harder for them to get than the \NSS-rank Breath of Archangel.
20402,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This is a gamble.
20403,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Witch's Love Potion \N\NIf player kisses a pill before \Nfeeding it to a target, target will \Nbecome beholden to player. \NEach pill will remain effective \Nfor one week. Each bottle \Ncontains 500 pills."
20404,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,VIP Multi-Pass \N\NPresent this pass to gain \Nentry into any location. \NContains 1000 passes.
20405,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Book.
20406,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,See ya.
20407,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That was uneventful.
20408,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Kind of disappointing.
20409,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I was so nervous...
20410,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"But now we've gathered \Nseven types, in three days!"
20411,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We're making decent progress.
20412,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Okay, let's keep this up."
20413,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Are there any other events in the city \Nfor getting restricted slot cards?
20414,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Hmm... I think there are...
20415,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Prizes from the slot machines?
20416,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Should've expected as much from \NDorias, the City of Gambling."
20417,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You have a 0.01% chance of winning.
20418,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That's one in ten thousand tries.
20419,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So it all comes down to luck.
20420,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Pretty risky.
20421,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I know, Gon!"
20422,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Use that dice!
20423,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This is it...
20424,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If we get Good Luck, we can win!"
20425,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"But if you get Bad Luck, something bad will happen that cancels out everything good that's happened."
20426,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There's only a one in twenty \Nchance of getting Bad Luck.
20427,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,There!
20428,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Next, we try the slot machine!"
20429,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Awesome! One try!
20430,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Rainbow Diamond \N\NA diamond that glitters like \Na rainbow. If this diamond \Nis presented when proposing, \Nyou will never be turned down."
20431,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,A Rainbow Diamond! Score!
20432,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That's what I thought...
20433,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This die is the key to winning in this city.
20434,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"But if you roll Bad Luck, it could be scary."
20435,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Don't worry.
20436,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It can't kill me...
20437,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!"
20438,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I knew something was wrong.
20439,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row.
20440,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,And he was acting weird...
20441,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,He kept rolling a funny-looking die.
20442,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Yikes, his face is mush..."
20443,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Anyway, let's make the trade."
20444,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S \Nand above as quickly as possible."
20445,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Yeah.
20446,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,As for cards rank A and below...
20447,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Roll.
20448,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,S-Spare me...
20449,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,This is only your third time.
20450,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,You'll be fine.
20451,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I-I know someone who got \NBad Luck on the first roll and died!
20452,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If I roll Bad Luck,"
20453,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I'll be hit for every Good Luck \Nthat the other players rolled!
20454,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Not my problem.
20455,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Roll.
20456,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Or would you rather die right now?
20457,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Come on...
20458,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,See?
20459,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's pretty rare to get Bad Luck.
20460,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Now we use the Lottery card.
20461,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"We want #75, Lucky Alexandrite."
20462,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"If you obtain one, we'll set you free."
20463,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,C-Come on...
20464,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Lottery on!
20465,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Well?
20466,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,#76!
20467,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,So close!
20468,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Your luck sucks.
20469,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Okay, one more time!"
20470,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
20471,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Time for Motarike-kun to \Nshow us what he's got!
20472,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"No good, huh?"
20473,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, Gen."
20474,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Should we make the first move?
20475,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I already told you that combat \Nshould be our last resort.
20476,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's too early for that.
20477,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"No, we're trying to stay \None step ahead of them."
20478,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Though, once we commit, further negotiation will be impossible."
20479,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What do you have in mind?
20480,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Tax Collector's Gauntlet \N\NWhen equipped, player has \Nthe ability to cast Levy. But \Neach cast will destroy a random \Ncard from player's restricted \Nslots. (Cannot use Levy if \Nrestricted slots are empty.)"
20481,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"We use Tax Collector's Gauntlet, combined with Risky Dice."
20482,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I understand.
20483,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We use this to steal eight cards \Nfrom them immediately...

20486,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,But this job is too important to leave to them.
20487,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We can do this!
20488,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,We've come this far. \NLet's clear the game.
20489,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, Gen..."
20490,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What are you up to?
20491,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I've told you this many times.
20492,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"When taking a risk, we three share the danger."
20493,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,It's Tsezgerra.
20494,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Have you reached a decision?
20495,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Okay, you have a deal."
20496,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,I can do this...
20497,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,One more time!
20498,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"I said I can do this, so I'm gonna do it!"
20499,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Okay, let's move on to the next city!"
20500,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Gon's team has begun \Nworking to beat the game.

20506,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"When you use this card, \Nit changes into a random card."
20507,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,That's why it's effective to use with Risky Dice.
20508,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Continue!
20509,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,Next time: 15 X 15.
20510,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Hey, Killua, is this fifteen?"
20511,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,What did you think it was?
20512,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,One five.
20513,Strategy x And x Scheme.,66,"Cute, huh..."

20517,15 X 15.,67,Yes! Halfway there!
20518,15 X 15.,67,That makes fifty types!
20519,15 X 15.,67,15 x 15
20520,15 X 15.,67,"Genthru and his men have a plan in mind, as they prepare to trade \Nwith Team Tsezgerra."
20521,15 X 15.,67,"Let's get this over with, then."
20522,15 X 15.,67,"Okay, trade complete."
20523,15 X 15.,67,"No, hold on."
20524,15 X 15.,67,I cannot accept this.
20525,15 X 15.,67,This is an unfair trade.
20526,15 X 15.,67,What? Don't complain once it's done!
20527,15 X 15.,67,We gave you three cards!
20528,15 X 15.,67,What more do you want?
20529,15 X 15.,67,Wait a second... \NThat isn't what I meant.
20530,15 X 15.,67,I'm saying that it's unfair to you.
20531,15 X 15.,67,It's too skewed in our favor.
20532,15 X 15.,67,I dislike the idea of \Nbenefiting from charity.
20533,15 X 15.,67,"And it will continue to bother me, even if we clear the game first."
20534,15 X 15.,67,So I have a proposition.
20535,15 X 15.,67,Right or left.
20536,15 X 15.,67,I'll give you one of these cards.
20537,15 X 15.,67,"One is worthless, but the other is Breath of Archangel."
20538,15 X 15.,67,Good Luck
20539,15 X 15.,67,Okay!
20540,15 X 15.,67,Levy on!
20541,15 X 15.,67,Crap!
20542,15 X 15.,67,Return on.
20543,15 X 15.,67,To Masadora!
20544,15 X 15.,67,Let's go after them!
20545,15 X 15.,67,Wait!
20546,15 X 15.,67,"First, check your cards!"
20547,15 X 15.,67,I lost one of the #80 cards \Nwe were monopolizing.
20548,15 X 15.,67,As well as a #65.
20549,15 X 15.,67,"Hey, what did you lose?"
20550,15 X 15.,67,I lost #42 and #53.
20551,15 X 15.,67,I lost #29 and #24.
20552,15 X 15.,67,They got me good!
20553,15 X 15.,67,I lost two of the #85 \Ncards we were hoarding.
20554,15 X 15.,67,All the ones they took were \Nrestricted slot cards...
20555,15 X 15.,67,And they took both card types \Nthat we were monopolizing.
20556,15 X 15.,67,Damn!
20557,15 X 15.,67,They must have used Risky Dice.
20558,15 X 15.,67,We're not with them!
20559,15 X 15.,67,They used items to change our faces!
20560,15 X 15.,67,"Anyway, we have to pursue them!"
20561,15 X 15.,67,No!
20562,15 X 15.,67,"Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?"
20563,15 X 15.,67,"U-Uh, we don't know."
20564,15 X 15.,67,But he went like this with his hand and\Nblew the head off the guy I was with.
20565,15 X 15.,67,A power clearly meant for murder.
20566,15 X 15.,67,So he's a fighter.
20567,15 X 15.,67,It would be unwise to \Nfight them head-on.
20568,15 X 15.,67,But they took at least five\N different card types from us!
20569,15 X 15.,67,They could have completed \Ntheir collection!
20570,15 X 15.,67,List on!
20571,15 X 15.,67,#2!
20572,15 X 15.,67,"Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore. \NCurrently, 0 cards in play."
20573,15 X 15.,67,We're still okay.
20574,15 X 15.,67,"They haven't found #2, \NPatch of Shore, yet."
20575,15 X 15.,67,Our immediate priority is to find #2 before they do!
20576,15 X 15.,67,"We still have our voucher \Nfor Breath of Archangel, so we can still beat them."
20577,15 X 15.,67,"Right, let's find it first, then."
20578,15 X 15.,67,Accompany \N\NWarp all players within 20 meters \Nof caster to city (must have been visited) \Nor player of your choice (must have \Nbeen met inside the game). \N\N[SR][NORM]
20579,15 X 15.,67,Accompany on!
20580,15 X 15.,67,To Soufrabi!
20581,15 X 15.,67,We did it... A big success.
20582,15 X 15.,67,The Risky Dice and Levy \Ncombination paid off.
20583,15 X 15.,67,That puts us at ninety-three types.
20584,15 X 15.,67,"No, we used one up to \Nchange those faces, so it's ninety-two."
20585,15 X 15.,67,The important thing is that we took \Nthe cards they were monopolizing.
20586,15 X 15.,67,"And for two of the others, we're just \Nwaiting for someone to use Gain on them."
20587,15 X 15.,67,The biggest obstacle is #2.
20588,15 X 15.,67,But we know that it's in Soufrabi.
20589,15 X 15.,67,"All right, we'll go after #72,"
20590,15 X 15.,67,"#21, and #9 in that order."
20591,15 X 15.,67,"Then we'll make for \NSoufrabi, to find #2."
20592,15 X 15.,67,"For #75, we simply need to find \Nsomeone with it, then take it."
20593,15 X 15.,67,I think it's time we began thinking...
20594,15 X 15.,67,"About the three restricted \Nslot cards we want to keep, and how we want to spend the 50 billion."
20595,15 X 15.,67,"Hey, Killua..."
20596,15 X 15.,67,Something's been bugging me.
20597,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20598,15 X 15.,67,Aren't there hundreds of players?
20599,15 X 15.,67,Isn't it weird that we've been able to turn all our items into cards?
20600,15 X 15.,67,What do you mean?
20601,15 X 15.,67,Even B-rank restricted slot types \Nhave a thirty-card limit.
20602,15 X 15.,67,The players here before us should \Nhave already collected them.
20603,15 X 15.,67,That's true.
20604,15 X 15.,67,But you can also see it this way.
20605,15 X 15.,67,Fewer than thirty teams in this game \Nare capable of making real progress.
20606,15 X 15.,67,"Oh, I see."
20607,15 X 15.,67,Most players aren't worried \Nabout getting restricted slot cards.
20608,15 X 15.,67,They're just struggling to find \Na way out of the game.
20609,15 X 15.,67,"It would suck if you got to Masadora, \Nand there weren't any Leave cards."
20610,15 X 15.,67,"Yeah, that's why..."
20611,15 X 15.,67,I get it...
20612,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20613,15 X 15.,67,"If you guys got to Masadora, \Nbut there weren't any Leave cards, what would you do?"
20614,15 X 15.,67,Well...
20615,15 X 15.,67,I'd save money until a Leave showed up.
20616,15 X 15.,67,Yeah.
20617,15 X 15.,67,"Okay, then what if you acquired a super rare \Nspell card while waiting?"
20618,15 X 15.,67,Sell it and buy more spell \Ncards until a Leave came in.
20619,15 X 15.,67,Really?!
20620,15 X 15.,67,I would save it...
20621,15 X 15.,67,Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you \Nbought ended up being worthless?
20622,15 X 15.,67,"If you saved it, you might be \Nable to trade for a Leave—"
20623,15 X 15.,67,See?
20624,15 X 15.,67,Need a Leave?
20625,15 X 15.,67,Want to go back to the real world?
20626,15 X 15.,67,We've gotten four restricted \Nslot cards for three Leaves.
20627,15 X 15.,67,"Okay, that makes a total \Nof fifty-four types."
20628,15 X 15.,67,Score!
20629,15 X 15.,67,So the cards that wouldn't fit in \Nour binders reverted to items.
20630,15 X 15.,67,We're running out of free pockets.
20631,15 X 15.,67,Then we should organize them now.
20632,15 X 15.,67,We three have a total \Nof 135 free pockets.
20633,15 X 15.,67,We should each leave \Naround 5 pockets free.
20634,15 X 15.,67,"You keep the spell cards, Killua."
20635,15 X 15.,67,Bisky should also have \Na few defensive ones.
20636,15 X 15.,67,Wait! I have to use spell cards?
20637,15 X 15.,67,No way! I don't know how they work.
20638,15 X 15.,67,The hell? Then learn how they work!
20639,15 X 15.,67,Okay...
20640,15 X 15.,67,Book.
20641,15 X 15.,67,"We've been deliberately \Navoiding other players, but we'll have to take risks \Nto obtain the rarer cards."
20642,15 X 15.,67,Yeah.
20643,15 X 15.,67,"Well, let's get what we can ourselves, then negotiate aggressively\N with any players we come across."
20644,15 X 15.,67,Sound good?
20645,15 X 15.,67,Yeah.
20646,15 X 15.,67,Yep!
20647,15 X 15.,67,See ya.
20648,15 X 15.,67,Hold on.
20649,15 X 15.,67,This is worthless.
20650,15 X 15.,67,It's a transformed Fake.
20651,15 X 15.,67,Sorry about that. \NI gave you the wrong one.
20652,15 X 15.,67,Here's the real one.
20653,15 X 15.,67,"Man, you can't lower your guard \Naround any of these guys."
20654,15 X 15.,67,No kidding...
20655,15 X 15.,67,"Still, that necklace is quite useful."
20656,15 X 15.,67,"Hey, this necklace can \Nremove curses, right?"
20657,15 X 15.,67,Only from spell cards.
20658,15 X 15.,67,"Oh, so it won't work."
20659,15 X 15.,67,Did you have an idea?
20660,15 X 15.,67,I was wondering if a curse \Nwas behind the disease that all those villagers \Nwere suffering from.
20661,15 X 15.,67,Villagers?
20662,15 X 15.,67,"Oh, those people..."
20663,15 X 15.,67,The ones who took all your money.
20664,15 X 15.,67,But it won't work since \Nthey aren't cards.
20665,15 X 15.,67,No.
20666,15 X 15.,67,It's worth a shot.
20667,15 X 15.,67,Will you trust us with your lives?
20668,15 X 15.,67,You freely gave us everything you had.
20669,15 X 15.,67,We will trust you!
20670,15 X 15.,67,Sick Villagers \N\NVillagers struck by a \Ncontagion passing \Naround the island.
20671,15 X 15.,67,Healthy Villagers \N\NHealthy villagers who \Nrecovered from the contagion \Ngoing around the island.
20672,15 X 15.,67,It worked!
20673,15 X 15.,67,Thank you very much!
20674,15 X 15.,67,This treasure has been \Npassed down for generations.
20675,15 X 15.,67,Please accept this \Ntoken of our gratitude.
20676,15 X 15.,67,Awesome!
20677,15 X 15.,67,"Lucky Alexandrite \N\NOwner will enjoy \Nonce-in-a-lifetime experiences, \Nfor better or for worse."
20678,15 X 15.,67,Lucky Alexandrite! Score!
20679,15 X 15.,67,Another player has used \NContact to reach you.
20680,15 X 15.,67,"Yo, this is Kazsule."
20681,15 X 15.,67,I'd like to talk to you.
20682,15 X 15.,67,Could we meet in person?
20683,15 X 15.,67,About what?
20684,15 X 15.,67,Some people are close \Nto clearing the game.
20685,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20686,15 X 15.,67,"It's a team of three, \Nled by someone named Genthru."
20687,15 X 15.,67,Genthru!
20688,15 X 15.,67,"Thanks for coming, everyone."
20689,15 X 15.,67,Much appreciated.
20690,15 X 15.,67,Team Kazsule
20691,15 X 15.,67,"As I mentioned via Contact,"
20692,15 X 15.,67,Team Asta
20693,15 X 15.,67,Team Genthru is close \Nto completing the game.
20694,15 X 15.,67,Team Hanse
20695,15 X 15.,67,"I just checked the ranking,"
20696,15 X 15.,67,Goreinu and they're currently \Nat ninety-six types.
20697,15 X 15.,67,Team Yabibi
20698,15 X 15.,67,We must figure out a way to stop them.
20699,15 X 15.,67,Can I ask something?
20700,15 X 15.,67,What is it?
20701,15 X 15.,67,How do you check the ranking?
20702,15 X 15.,67,Well...
20703,15 X 15.,67,You don't know how to do that?
20704,15 X 15.,67,"If we answer all their questions, \Nwe'll be here till dawn!"
20705,15 X 15.,67,Just cut to the chase.
20706,15 X 15.,67,"Now, don't be so mean..."
20707,15 X 15.,67,We're all here to exchange information.
20708,15 X 15.,67,"They could have information \Nyou don't, Asta."
20709,15 X 15.,67,That's impossible.
20710,15 X 15.,67,Those kids are amateurs who don't even \Nknow how to use the Trade Shop.
20711,15 X 15.,67,"In the Trade Shop, there's a ranking that lists \Nplayers and their total restricted slot cards."
20712,15 X 15.,67,"If you pay a fee, you can even learn \Nthe numbers of their cards."
20713,15 X 15.,67,But getting a player's name from \Nthe ranking still won't let you use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.
20714,15 X 15.,67,Not until you actually meet them.
20715,15 X 15.,67,"Don't you feel smarter now, boys?"
20716,15 X 15.,67,"In other words, if we know \Nthe members of a team, we can determine how \Nmany cards they have."
20717,15 X 15.,67,"And Team Genthru is only missing #0,"
20718,15 X 15.,67,"#2, #9, and #75."
20719,15 X 15.,67,#75...
20720,15 X 15.,67,"There's a solid theory that #0 appears in an event after the other \Nninety-nine are collected, so they only need three."
20721,15 X 15.,67,"We propose to find one of those \Nthree types before they do and monopolize it, to prevent \Nthem from clearing the game."
20722,15 X 15.,67,There's gotta be something else.
20723,15 X 15.,67,We could deluge them with spell cards.
20724,15 X 15.,67,They already have a Paladin's Necklace.
20725,15 X 15.,67,So Levy is the only \Nspell that will work.
20726,15 X 15.,67,Levy \N\NTake 1 card at random from every \Nplayer within 20 meters of caster. \N\N[SR][SP]
20727,15 X 15.,67,And they can block Levy if \Ncertain conditions are met.
20728,15 X 15.,67,It's safe to assume that Genthru is willing to reveal \Nthat they have ninety-six types
20729,15 X 15.,67,Prison \N\NAll slotted cards on target page are \Nimmune to theft or destruction via spell card \Nuntil removed. \N(Only targets \Npages 1 - 11. \NFree slot pages \Ncannot be targeted.) \N\N[DEF][CONT] because their pages are \Nprotected by Prison.
20730,15 X 15.,67,That's possible...
20731,15 X 15.,67,Genthru was collecting \Na bunch of spell cards with the others who tried to recruit us.
20732,15 X 15.,67,It's a reasonable assumption.
20733,15 X 15.,67,We could always take \Ntheir cards by force.
20734,15 X 15.,67,Would you be willing to lead the attack?
20735,15 X 15.,67,We don't know what kind \Nof abilities they have.
20736,15 X 15.,67,Finding a card type to monopolize \Nis the most practical option.
20737,15 X 15.,67,I assume no one has objections.
20738,15 X 15.,67,Then let's get to business.
20739,15 X 15.,67,We'll need everyone here to cooperate.
20740,15 X 15.,67,I'm fine with the proposed plan.
20741,15 X 15.,67,But I have a problem with these members.
20742,15 X 15.,67,"Hold on, Asta."
20743,15 X 15.,67,I followed your condition...
20744,15 X 15.,67,Have over fifty types of cards.
20745,15 X 15.,67,These six teams met that condition.
20746,15 X 15.,67,I also said that they had to be \Npeople who could contribute.
20747,15 X 15.,67,I don't see how these kids \Ncan contribute anything.
20748,15 X 15.,67,You're the one being uncooperative.
20749,15 X 15.,67,You've got a smart mouth.
20750,15 X 15.,67,Then show me some proof \Nthat you can be useful.
20751,15 X 15.,67,We know Team Genthru's abilities.
20752,15 X 15.,67,We have one of the three \Ncards they're missing.
20753,15 X 15.,67,Still dissatisfied?
20754,15 X 15.,67,"No, that's good enough."
20755,15 X 15.,67,So tell us what their abilities are.
20756,15 X 15.,67,What about you?
20757,15 X 15.,67,Show us some proof you \Ncan be useful to us.
20758,15 X 15.,67,We have seventy-one types \Nof restricted slot cards...
20759,15 X 15.,67,Significantly more than you.
20760,15 X 15.,67,I'll give you an A-rank card in \Nreturn for the information.
20761,15 X 15.,67,You shouldn't have a problem with that.
20762,15 X 15.,67,I have a problem.
20763,15 X 15.,67,We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.
20764,15 X 15.,67,So give us two S-rank cards or \Nequally valuable information.
20765,15 X 15.,67,"Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing."
20766,15 X 15.,67,"Don't get too cocky, brat!"
20767,15 X 15.,67,"Did you hear that, everyone?"
20768,15 X 15.,67,These kids won't be any help.
20769,15 X 15.,67,They want two S-rank \Ncards from each team.
20770,15 X 15.,67,That's ten cards they'd take.
20771,15 X 15.,67,Don't be a fool.
20772,15 X 15.,67,I'm only taking cards from your team.
20773,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20774,15 X 15.,67,I'm fine with giving information \Nto the other four.
20775,15 X 15.,67,I'll let them decide \Nwhat to offer in return.
20776,15 X 15.,67,But I won't tell you anything \Nuntil you meet my condition.
20777,15 X 15.,67,You are a stupid brat...
20778,15 X 15.,67,"Throwing a tantrum because \NI didn't baby you, huh?"
20779,15 X 15.,67,"Stop this, both of you..."
20780,15 X 15.,67,We don't have time to \Nfight amongst ourselves!
20781,15 X 15.,67,I haven't agreed to \Nteam up with them yet!
20782,15 X 15.,67,"It's fine, Asta..."
20783,15 X 15.,67,Give them two cards.
20784,15 X 15.,67,We need to move on.
20785,15 X 15.,67,What?!
20786,15 X 15.,67,I have no problem with \Ngiving them cards!
20787,15 X 15.,67,But that kid's trying to pick a fight!
20788,15 X 15.,67,You're the one picking a fight!
20789,15 X 15.,67,"Hey, let's leave."
20790,15 X 15.,67,I don't want to team \Nup with these people!
20791,15 X 15.,67,"Come, now... \NThough I admit I'm a bit peeved."
20792,15 X 15.,67,But given the circumstances...
20793,15 X 15.,67,"Genthru has these two abilities, \NCountdown and Little Flower."
20794,15 X 15.,67,So it's best to keep \Nyour distance from him.
20795,15 X 15.,67,Seriously? He got me...
20796,15 X 15.,67,Same here.
20797,15 X 15.,67,He touched me when we \Nwere making a deal.
20798,15 X 15.,67,"Me, too..."
20799,15 X 15.,67,Sounds like a bunch of \Nthem might be victims.
20800,15 X 15.,67,A chance!
20801,15 X 15.,67,Isn't there any way to \Ndisable his technique?
20802,15 X 15.,67,"Yep, there is..."
20803,15 X 15.,67,"You have to touch Genthru and say, \N""I caught the Bomber."""
20804,15 X 15.,67,Stupid! Why did you tell them?
20805,15 X 15.,67,We could've gotten more \Ncards out of them!
20806,15 X 15.,67,That would have started another fight.
20807,15 X 15.,67,"The bombs can't be armed until Genthru \Nexplains how his ability works, so if you keep away from him, you should be safe."
20808,15 X 15.,67,Did you know there are \Ntwo ways to cast spells?
20809,15 X 15.,67,"Yep, I did."
20810,15 X 15.,67,A spell card is used up the\N moment you say its name aloud.
20811,15 X 15.,67,But it's possible to \Nkeep reusing a spell.
20812,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20813,15 X 15.,67,"For example, you know how a list of players you've met appears if \Nyou put Steal in your binder?"
20814,15 X 15.,67,"If you remove the card without \Npressing the select button, the spell card isn't used up, \Nso you can keep reusing it."
20815,15 X 15.,67,I never tried that.
20816,15 X 15.,67,Yeah.
20817,15 X 15.,67,You can buy all B-rank \Nrestricted slot cards at stores.
20818,15 X 15.,67,You simply need to buy from the \Nsame Trade Shop over fifty times.
20819,15 X 15.,67,"If you become a frequent customer, \Nthey'll start making you offers."
20820,15 X 15.,67,Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?
20821,15 X 15.,67,Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?
20822,15 X 15.,67,Is that enough information to satisfy you?
20823,15 X 15.,67,I'll give you another \Ncard if you're not happy.
20824,15 X 15.,67,"Nope, that's enough, thanks!"
20825,15 X 15.,67,"I'm up next, then."
20826,15 X 15.,67,I'm Goreinu.
20827,15 X 15.,67,Nice to meet you.
20828,15 X 15.,67,"Thanks, everyone!"
20829,15 X 15.,67,That was very educational.
20830,15 X 15.,67,The question now is which card \Nwe should try to monopolize.
20831,15 X 15.,67,It's probably impossible to \Nmonopolize the #75 we have.
20832,15 X 15.,67,"Each team can only obtain one, \Nand the limit is twenty, which is too high."
20833,15 X 15.,67,You obtained #75?
20834,15 X 15.,67,That's impressive.
20835,15 X 15.,67,List on!
20836,15 X 15.,67,#75.
20837,15 X 15.,67,"Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite. \NCurrently, 6 cards are in play."
20838,15 X 15.,67,So five other teams each have one.
20839,15 X 15.,67,Monopolizing this one \Nwill be impossible.
20840,15 X 15.,67,What about the other two?
20841,15 X 15.,67,List on!
20842,15 X 15.,67,#9!
20843,15 X 15.,67,List on.
20844,15 X 15.,67,#2.
20845,15 X 15.,67,No good.
20846,15 X 15.,67,There are three teams with #9.
20847,15 X 15.,67,"No one has #2, Patch of Shore..."
20848,15 X 15.,67,We can make it work!
20849,15 X 15.,67,Guide Post On.
20850,15 X 15.,67,#2.
20851,15 X 15.,67,I know where to find it...
20852,15 X 15.,67,Soufrabi.
20853,15 X 15.,67,I've been there before!
20854,15 X 15.,67,I have an Accompany card here.
20855,15 X 15.,67,"Okay, let's go."
20856,15 X 15.,67,Accompany on!
20857,15 X 15.,67,To Soufrabi!
20858,15 X 15.,67,This is Soufrabi?
20859,15 X 15.,67,It's a pretty big city...
20860,15 X 15.,67,Soufrabi
20861,15 X 15.,67,Let's head in and snoop around.
20862,15 X 15.,67,"Search every room, one by one."
20863,15 X 15.,67,"Some characters may not \Ngive you information until you visit multiple \Ntimes, so pay attention."
20864,15 X 15.,67,Okay!
20865,15 X 15.,67,Hey!
20866,15 X 15.,67,I found someone with information.
20867,15 X 15.,67,Fast!
20868,15 X 15.,67,The pirates rule this city...
20869,15 X 15.,67,There's a legend about \Nan underwater cavern called the Sea God's Grotto \Nlocated somewhere in this area.
20870,15 X 15.,67,Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.
20871,15 X 15.,67,"A few years ago, having heard of the \Nlegendary cavern and its treasure, fifteen pirates arrived in this city."
20872,15 X 15.,67,Razor and the fourteen devils...
20873,15 X 15.,67,The city fishermen were \Nall tortured and killed.
20874,15 X 15.,67,The pirates murdered anyone who \Nknew about Patch of Shore.
20875,15 X 15.,67,"If you get rid of the pirates, \NI'll tell you what I know."
20876,15 X 15.,67,"When we visited a few months earlier, \Nwe couldn't find a single clue."
20877,15 X 15.,67,This must be information only \Navailable at certain times.
20878,15 X 15.,67,Maybe an event that only \Noccurs at this time frame?
20879,15 X 15.,67,Razor and the fourteen devils...
20880,15 X 15.,67,It's possible that the event was triggered by the \Nnumber of players here.
20881,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20882,15 X 15.,67,There are fifteen pirates.
20883,15 X 15.,67,And it just so happens that \Nthere are fifteen of us.
20884,15 X 15.,67,So the event won't start until you \Nhave a party of fifteen or more?
20885,15 X 15.,67,But how would a game \Ncharacter know that?
20886,15 X 15.,67,"Oh, Accompany!"
20887,15 X 15.,67,"Yes, a group of fifteen or more must \Nreach Soufrabi with Accompany."
20888,15 X 15.,67,That's probably the \Ntrigger for this event.
20889,15 X 15.,67,Brutal...
20890,15 X 15.,67,Huh?
20891,15 X 15.,67,"Oh, nothing."
20892,15 X 15.,67,Let's go to the pirate's base!
20893,15 X 15.,67,Gon and his friends stand before \Nsome unpleasant looking pirates.
20894,15 X 15.,67,Will the fifteen allies be able \Nto obtain Patch of Shore?
20895,15 X 15.,67,G.I. Tutorial
20896,15 X 15.,67,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
20897,15 X 15.,67,"Today, we introduce the card \NTax Collector's Gauntlet."
20898,15 X 15.,67,"Tax Collector's Gauntlet \N\NWhen equipped, player has \Nthe ability to cast Levy. But \Neach cast will destroy a random \Ncard from player's restricted \Nslots. (Cannot use Levy if \Nrestricted slots are empty.)"
20899,15 X 15.,67,"If you turn this card into \Nan item and equip it, you can steal random cards from others."
20900,15 X 15.,67,And you can keep reusing it!
20901,15 X 15.,67,Clunk.
20902,15 X 15.,67,Continue!
20903,15 X 15.,67,Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.
20904,15 X 15.,67,Go!
20905,15 X 15.,67,I can't say that!
20906,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Who are you guys?
20907,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We booked this place for the night.
20908,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Get lost!
20909,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We're here to talk.
20910,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Would you please leave the city?
20911,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Been a long time since I heard those words.
20912,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Pirates x And x Guesses
20913,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Then no need for talk. \NUse force to make us leave.
20914,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I don't care how many of you attack at once.
20915,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If you can move me from this ring,"
20916,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'll take you to see our boss.
20917,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We just have to move you out of the ring?
20918,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If it's brawn you want, I'm your man."
20919,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This guy's terrible.
20920,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He's taking too long just to \N produce that degree of{\i0
20921,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You're pretty strong...
20922,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Stop it!
20923,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I lose... Let me go!
20924,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He admitted defeat.
20925,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why didn't you let him go?
20926,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I explained the rules.
20927,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You lose if you step outside the ring.
20928,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Anything else, including admitting\N defeat, is totally meaningless."
20929,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You kicked me, then stepped \Noutside the ring of fire."
20930,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You've lost.
20931,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Oh! Crap!
20932,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hold on! Give me another try!
20933,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Don't bother, Gon..."
20934,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You're probably looking to \Nuse your new technique.
20935,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But you shouldn't reveal it in \Nfront of all these people.
20936,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Just let me handle this.
20937,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What's this? You gonna pair up now?
20938,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'll be using this.
20939,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You wouldn't...
20940,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"There, I win."
20941,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,D-Damn little brat!
20942,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You made up the rules...
20943,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Don't get upset.
20944,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Yeah, my bad..."
20945,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Come with me.
20946,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'll take you to the boss.
20947,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Eh, so your boss is in here?"
20948,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Boss, we have visitors."
20949,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Who are these guys?
20950,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,They want to chase us out of town.
20951,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Chase us out?
20952,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Ah...
20953,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Let's have a contest.
20954,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If you win, we'll leave the island."
20955,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"However, we choose the contest."
20956,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,How does that sound?
20957,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What happens if we lose?
20958,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Nothing.
20959,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You'll just have to leave.
20960,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Okay, let's do this!"
20961,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,The theme of this battle is sports.
20962,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Each of these members will challenge \Nyou to a match in their best sport.
20963,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,One win per person!
20964,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,The first side to eight wins will be the victor.
20965,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'm up first... I'll go with boxing.
20966,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Well? Who's up?
20967,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I've got this.
20968,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's one special rule.
20969,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Nen{\i0
20970,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What?
20971,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You can't call that boxing!
20972,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Don't worry, I'll only use my fists."
20973,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That rule's for your benefit.
20974,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Wanna tag out?
20975,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"No, I'll do it."
20976,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Fight!
20977,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I know what's going on here...
20978,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's a reason you chose boxing!
20979,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You're also an Emitter, right?"
20980,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"We're fighting at close range, \Nwithin a finite space."
20981,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This is the ideal situation for an Emitter.
20982,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"However, you made one mistake!"
20983,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Not anticipating that my power \Ncould be stronger than yours!
20984,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Wow! He can't dodge that flurry!
20985,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Yes, he's down! Too easy!"
20986,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"No, it was a simultaneous hit."
20987,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What just happened?
20988,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why?
20989,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,These guys didn't see what happened?
20990,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He used teleportation.
20991,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Teleportation?
20992,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Of only his fist, with a short uppercut."
20993,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,His goal was to land a knockout counterstrike.
20994,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It was obvious.
20995,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Seems he's out cold...
20996,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's one win for us.
20997,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Damn.
20998,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Bah.
20999,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Reaching eight wins with these \Nmembers will be impossible.
21000,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Meaning...
21001,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Okay, I'm up next..."
21002,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'll go with juggling soccer balls.
21003,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Then I'm up...
21004,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Wait, Gon."
21005,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Indeed, that would be wise."
21006,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Okay, I'm up next!"
21007,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,A little girl?
21008,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Now I'll have to take care not to injure you.
21009,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Injure me with juggling?
21010,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Nen{\i0
21011,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Provided you don't touch \Nthe ball with your hands.
21012,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I understand.
21013,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Moving anywhere inside the building is allowed.
21014,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Whoever drops their ball first loses.
21015,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Right! Got it!
21016,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Okay, let's get started."
21017,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Ready...
21018,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Go!
21019,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What?
21020,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That was harder than I expected...
21021,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I lose.
21022,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"I'm up next, then."
21023,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You wanna go, big guy?"
21024,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You bet! Prepare yourself, brat!"
21025,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Ready, begin!"
21026,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'll crush you!
21027,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Oh, sorry about that..."
21028,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I stepped outside the ring.
21029,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Now I see... That's what they're doing.
21030,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's eight wins.
21031,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We're the victors.
21032,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Get out.
21033,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,And we can do as we please in this city.
21034,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Damn it, you brat! Come back here!"
21035,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We need to fight again!
21036,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"When you saw we couldn't \Nwin with this lineup, you decided to lose deliberately, \Nand gather information, huh?"
21037,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"But once a party has lost, \Nthey can't make another attempt."
21038,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But it's okay if we simply \Nswitch out one member.
21039,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It was a worthwhile risk.
21040,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You can count us out.
21041,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Huh?
21042,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"We've accomplished our original objective, keeping the Bombers from completing the game."
21043,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It will be impossible for them to \Nassemble a team of fifteen.
21044,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You should probably give up on this contest.
21045,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If you end up obtaining the card, \Nyou'll just become a target."
21046,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,They don't get it...
21047,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It makes sense to obtain this card quickly.
21048,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,To avoid potential internal conflict.
21049,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Exactly.
21050,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Huh?
21051,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You need at least fifteen people to participate.
21052,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Even if you use Clone,"
21053,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Clone \N\NTransform into a random card \Nselected from the restricted slots \Nof one target player. (If target has \Nempty restricted slots or max of \Nselected card has been reached, \NClone is used up without transforming. \N\N[LR][NORM] you can only obtain three \Ncopies of Patch of Shore."
21054,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This event was designed to incite infighting.
21055,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's what you meant.
21056,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Brutal...
21057,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"I had to think about that, since I \Ndidn't understand right away."
21058,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Assuming that we four are capable of winning, we still need four more up to the task."
21059,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"And ideally, they'd already \Nbe in a party of eleven."
21060,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Do you have any leads?
21061,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Book.
21062,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Looking at the names on my list, \NChrollo's probably the strongest."
21063,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But Kurapika said he's definitely a fake.
21064,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Who is it, then?"
21065,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Well, it's probably a member of the Troupe."
21066,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why would a member of the Troupe be here?
21067,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Maybe to beat the game?
21068,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But wouldn't they have used their own name?
21069,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's true.
21070,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We can use Sight Vision.
21071,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Huh?
21072,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If this person isn't here to beat the game, they won't bother to collect cards."
21073,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Oh, that's right."
21074,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,0 cards in restricted slots \N6 cards in free slots
21075,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This guy's not even trying.
21076,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,His only cards are for food and water.
21077,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That makes it easier to invite them.
21078,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"But if it really is a member of the \NTroupe, we won't invite them."
21079,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We'll just ask a few questions.
21080,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Then there's no point in bothering.
21081,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Since it's definitely one of them.
21082,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Finding out who they are is important, \Nbut I'd rather learn why they're here!"
21083,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Are you an idiot?!
21084,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You're gonna ask them why they're here?
21085,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,They aren't gonna tell you!
21086,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Yeah, I'm an idiot!"
21087,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"I'm an idiot, so I'm still gonna ask!"
21088,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Then go right ahead!
21089,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I sure will!
21090,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Will they be okay?
21091,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This is perfectly normal for them.
21092,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"I'm off, then!"
21093,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Knock yourself out.
21094,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Accompany on!
21095,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Chrollo Lucilfer.
21096,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,No way...
21097,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hisoka!
21098,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Well, well..."
21099,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I have unexpected visitors.
21100,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It's been a while.
21101,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,As I thought.
21102,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You've matured quite a lot.
21103,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It appears that you found \Nan excellent teacher.
21104,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"As I anticipated, you grow more \Nappetizing with every day."
21105,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Wh-Who is this pervy freak?
21106,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Are you their teacher?
21107,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"No, it doesn't seem to be him."
21108,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Stop it!
21109,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,She's the one?
21110,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"So what do you want with me... \NNo, with Chrollo?"
21111,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I have a question.
21112,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why are you here?
21113,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Well, what to do?"
21114,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If I talk, I know how they'll react."
21115,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,They'll do all they can to keep the spiders from the {\i0
21116,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That would certainly be entertaining.
21117,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But I have delayed my fight \Nwith Chrollo long enough.
21118,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'm looking for Chrollo.
21119,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's actually a way
21120,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Nen{\i0
21121,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You can purge it.
21122,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,So you knew?
21123,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Then that makes this easier.
21124,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"I'm looking for Chrollo,\Nto give him that information, but I have no leads."
21125,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's when I remembered that some of the spiders were \Ninterested in this game.
21126,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I thought that maybe they would \Nknow Chrollo's whereabouts.
21127,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"And by choosing this name, I ensure \Nthat they will come to me."
21128,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I get it.
21129,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He was just pretending to \Nbe a member of the Troupe.
21130,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Uh-huh.
21131,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Now, it is my turn for a question."
21132,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You didn't come here just \Nto ask that, did you?"
21133,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"No, I did."
21134,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Um...
21135,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Actually, we're looking for \Npeople who are really strong."
21136,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Won't you please join us?
21137,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hmm? Sure.
21138,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why are you looking for strong people?
21139,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Wait, h-hold on... I'm against this."
21140,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It's too dangerous!
21141,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Yeah, you don't know who this guy is, Bisky!"
21142,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Oh? That's not true.
21143,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I can sense that he's a kindred spirit.
21144,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He's lying.
21145,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"We should head to the \NCity of Love just ahead, Aiai."
21146,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It's a great place for new meetings.
21147,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Perhaps you can find strong people there.
21148,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What did you mean about him lying?
21149,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Technically, I should say he \Nwasn't speaking the truth."
21150,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,How could you tell?
21151,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I had a gut feeling.
21152,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,A gut feeling?!
21153,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"After lying for fifty years, \NI can recognize a fellow liar."
21154,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's a convincing argument.
21155,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Since he's hiding something, we'll keep him around to see what's up."
21156,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Plus, he really is strong, right?"
21157,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Uh-huh...
21158,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Hey, Hisoka!"
21159,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You walk in front!
21160,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"We need ten more members, correct?"
21161,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Yeah...
21162,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We hope to find others like you \Nwho aren't interested in cards.
21163,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Isn't everyone else here to beat the game?
21164,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I can't imagine there are too \Nmany eccentrics like myself.
21165,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He's definitely hiding something.
21166,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"By the way, did you use someone's power to warp to me?"
21167,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That was one of the spells in this game.
21168,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Oh, so that's what it was."
21169,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"You need to buy spells from stores, right?"
21170,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Something does seem fishy.
21171,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He isn't being honest.
21172,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"In other words, there's something \Ninconsistent in his story."
21173,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He came here to find spiders who \Nmight know Chrollo's location.
21174,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's something off about that explanation.
21175,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"City of Love, Aiai"
21176,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Where are my glasses?
21177,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Why not give them to her?
21178,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You might become friends.
21179,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hey...
21180,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Watch where you're going!
21181,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Be more careful.
21182,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,S-Sorry...
21183,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I'm gonna be late!
21184,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You weren't supposed to apologize... she{\i0
21185,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Stop it!
21186,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Release me! I'll scream...
21187,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Go ahead and scream.
21188,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,No one's coming to save you.
21189,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hold it!
21190,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Let go of her!
21191,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That hurt...
21192,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,How could you fall for such a cliché?!
21193,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,You want me to model for your hairstyling?
21194,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Please allow me to cut your long, lovely hair."
21195,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Of course.
21196,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's no point in hanging around this city.
21197,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Hisoka, let's head somewhere else."
21198,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Oh?
21199,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But we won't be bored here.
21200,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Bored...
21201,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's it!
21202,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's what was wrong.
21203,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This place...
21204,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,This place is the problem!
21205,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If I entered this game to find someone, what would I do?"
21206,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I would see how important \Nthe spell cards are.
21207,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Gon and Bisky ran into Hisoka while I was outside, taking the Hunter Exam."
21208,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That means they encountered him while they were training near Masadora.
21209,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hisoka's been to Masadora!
21210,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Right, normally it makes no sense \Nfor him to leave Masadora."
21211,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Because most players pass through \Nthe city, in search of spell cards."
21212,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If he were truly looking for the Troupe, \Nhe wouldn't have left Masadora."
21213,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,But we won't be bored here.
21214,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He's bored because he has nothing to do.
21215,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,So he isn't looking for anyone.
21216,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,No...
21217,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He's already found them!
21218,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That must be it!
21219,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's in line with what Bisky said.
21220,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Hisoka already met up with the Troupe, and he's waiting for something."
21221,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,What is he waiting for?
21222,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's obvious...
21223,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,The {\i0
21224,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,The {\i0
21225,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hisoka and the Troupe know this.
21226,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I can't tell Gon yet...
21227,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He can't keep a secret.
21228,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If Hisoka realizes we know, he'll disappear."
21229,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If he leaves, we'll be down a member."
21230,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,And we won't know what \Nthe Troupe is doing.
21231,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We can't let that happen.
21232,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Hey, Killua... I've been thinking."
21233,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We should probably try to recruit Tsezgerra.
21234,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Even if he doesn't join, \Nwe should meet with him, so he'll be on our binder list."
21235,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,It would be good to know what they're doing.
21236,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Binder? I can find out!
21237,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Hisoka, let me see your binder."
21238,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I want to see if Tsezgerra is on the list of players you've met.
21239,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,List?
21240,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,That's perfect!
21241,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If I asked questions, Hisoka would be suspicious."
21242,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"But Gon knows nothing, \Nso Hisoka won't suspect a thing."
21243,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Book.
21244,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"If Hisoka refuses to show us the screen, \Nthat'll support my theory."
21245,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There's Tsezgerra.
21246,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Really?
21247,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Yes, right here."
21248,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Huh?
21249,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,He showed us? No way!
21250,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,There aren't any Troupe members...
21251,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Was I being paranoid?
21252,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Is Hisoka actually still looking for them?
21253,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Then, Hisoka, recite this spell..."
21254,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,We'll do the talking.
21255,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Contact on.
21256,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Tsezgerra.
21257,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,My Texture Surprise really is so very useful.
21258,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Shizuku \N\NPhinks \N\NFranklin \N\NShalnark
21259,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Hisoka's ability fools Killua and his friends.
21260,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Is Hisoka a friend or foe?
21261,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,G.I. Tutorial
21262,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
21263,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Today, we introduce the card Paladin's Necklace."
21264,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Paladin's Necklace \N\NWhen a player wears this, \Nall spells targeting player \Nwill be reflected. \NCan also dispel curses \Nplaced on any card \Ntouched by player."
21265,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"This card can reflect enemy spells, \Nand tell you if other cards are real."
21266,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Are you real?
21267,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Huh?
21268,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Continue!
21269,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,Next time: A x Heated x Showdown.
21270,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,I win!
21271,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,One more time!
21272,Pirates x And x Guesses.,68,"Gon, where are you going?"
21273,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Together, there are five of you?"
21274,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yeah, this is all of us."
21275,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,There are two others in my group.
21276,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This only gives us a total of nine.
21277,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Where do you plan to find the rest?
21278,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"We'll need fifteen members, right?"
21279,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.
21280,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Invite players who want to return \Nto the real world but can't.
21281,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"They won't be able to help, but they won't care about \Nreceiving cards, either."
21282,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Meaning that the nine of us will \Nhave to win the contest.
21283,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"I don't know how strong our \Nopponents are, but can we?"
21284,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We can.
21285,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Even if we can't manage eight wins, we're allowed to switch members and try again."
21286,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,So whether we can win depends on you guys.
21287,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ren{\i0
21288,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We'll decide if we want you afterwards.
21289,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,A x Heated x Showdown
21290,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I see our roles have been reversed.
21291,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Very well.
21292,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Here I go!
21293,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Awesome!
21294,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If I use my full strength, I can fly higher."
21295,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"My record is sixteen meters, \Neighty centimeters."
21296,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Ready, and..."
21297,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,They shattered my record with ease.
21298,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Ha ha, I win."
21299,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,How much have they improved \Nin such a short period of time?
21300,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Darn!
21301,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I am impressed.
21302,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Although you still fall a bit \Nshort of my full height.
21303,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Okay! Let's go again!
21304,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,No way.
21305,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You won't stop until you win.
21306,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,One more time... Just once more!
21307,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Oh, you passed."
21308,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nice jump.
21309,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Sorry...
21310,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Once more!
21311,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"They're only kids, so let it slide."
21312,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Fine.
21313,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We believe that you guys are strong.
21314,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But it comes down to figuring out \Nwho to assign to which sport.
21315,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Killua, once more!"
21316,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"See, I knew it..."
21317,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,No more. I win!
21318,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Do we know all the sports they'll use?
21319,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We've managed to confirm these eight.
21320,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Beach Volleyball \NWrestling \NBoxing \NJuggling \NFree Throws \NSumo \NBowling \NPing Pong
21321,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Depending on our success, \Nthey may add additional sports."
21322,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I understand...
21323,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hey, this is bad!"
21324,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,What is it?
21325,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.
21326,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Then they're only missing...
21327,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!
21328,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Over the past week, we've run various simulations and have prepared accordingly."
21329,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Given Team Genthru's current situation, we can't afford to lose."
21330,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We have to win!
21331,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yes, we'll win."
21332,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This isn't too bad...
21333,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, let's go."
21334,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We'll begin with boxing.
21335,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll send you packing.
21336,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,His special ability is teleportation.
21337,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He can teleport his uppercut.
21338,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Fight!
21339,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,H-He's fast!
21340,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,An infighter?
21341,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If I'm close enough, his Emitter \Nadvantages are worthless."
21342,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"He'll be so busy guarding, he won't have a chance to use teleportation!"
21343,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nice!
21344,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The pattern depicted on the ring is a sacred symbol that boosts {\i0
21345,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Suggesting that he can only teleport while standing within the ring.
21346,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Essentially, he's revealing that \Nhe isn't all that strong."
21347,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,An opponent unworthy of us.
21348,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The winner is Barry!
21349,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Yes!
21350,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The winner is Rodriot!
21351,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The winner is Kess!
21352,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Yes!
21353,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That's three wins!
21354,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"In terms of combat strength, those six are very strong."
21355,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is getting interesting...
21356,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You guys can toss your matches.
21357,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll take it from here.
21358,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Roger that.
21359,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Wait!
21360,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm done following your orders.
21361,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll be doing things my own way now.
21362,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hey, brat! Let's step outside!"
21363,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?
21364,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm done playing around.
21365,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Want me to kill you here?
21366,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hey, Bobobo!"
21367,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That's a violation of our agreement.
21368,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?"
21369,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I don't give a damn!
21370,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm done playing this stupid game!
21371,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Anyone else with me?
21372,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If we team up, we can crush that bastard."
21373,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,And then we can use a ship \Nto get off this island!
21374,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.
21375,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Didn't I warn you?
21376,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Y-Yes, you did..."
21377,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?
21378,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, I'll go next."
21379,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hey, this looks bad."
21380,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We can't fight those guys...
21381,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"No, hold on."
21382,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We'll be doing the fighting.
21383,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We explained how this works.
21384,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories, you can just forfeit without fighting."
21385,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Really?
21386,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You guarantee we won't have to fight?
21387,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yeah, don't worry."
21388,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.
21389,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"And judging by the previous conversation, he must be a Game Master."
21390,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Can I ask something?
21391,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That guy's dead.
21392,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,What about the sumo match?
21393,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hmm? Oh, you get the win."
21394,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But we never decided who we were sending.
21395,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You're the one who said you \Nwere going to do the sumo.
21396,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I don't care who you give the win to.
21397,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Just give it to one of the guys \Nstanding in the back.
21398,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, you get the sumo win."
21399,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Eh? Wait, me?"
21400,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That gives us four wins.
21401,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Now, then..."
21402,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll go with an eight-on-eight game of dodgeball.
21403,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Pick the eight members you'll field.
21404,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I already have mine.
21405,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Hold on...
21406,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,How is this scored?
21407,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"It's one win per person, right?"
21408,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yes, one win per person."
21409,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,So the victorious team receives eight wins.
21410,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Simple enough, yes?"
21411,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,So that was the plan?
21412,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"No matter how many of his weaker members we defeat, he can still win \Nthe entire game alone."
21413,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Razor and the fourteen devils...
21414,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The devils are his{\i0
21415,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm against this...
21416,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If we have to field eight, you need two more!"
21417,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm not fighting that guy!
21418,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm leaving now...
21419,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Once the match begins, you can deliberately let yourself be hit—"
21420,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Screw that!
21421,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Didn't you see that?
21422,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!"
21423,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Oh, just so everything is clear, \Nwe'll be using a normal ball."
21424,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nen{\i0
21425,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is crazy... I'm outta here!
21426,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Sorry, but I don't want to die yet..."
21427,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,H-Hold on!
21428,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We'll think of something real quick.
21429,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is very bad.
21430,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We only have six players of any use.
21431,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,So we're forced to pick two \Nof these spineless wimps.
21432,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We'll do this by ourselves.
21433,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If our lives are on the line, we should only field willing players."
21434,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Do you have a problem if we only field six?
21435,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yes, actually, I can't let you do that..."
21436,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You will have to field eight members.
21437,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?"
21438,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Saying this to an in-game character \Nis probably pointless, but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?"
21439,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,What did he do to deserve death?
21440,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Burglary-murder and rape-murder.
21441,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Eleven confirmed counts alone.
21442,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is the real world.
21443,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"This place, Greed Island, is located \Nsomewhere in the real world."
21444,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This game takes place in the real world.
21445,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Revealing that information to a player who \Nbelieves they're inside a game is a taboo.
21446,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.
21447,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"This guy, Razor, is a Game Master, a real human."
21448,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Game Master?
21449,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,One of the people who made this game.
21450,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Huh?
21451,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Wait, then..."
21452,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Bobobo and the other pirates \Nare real death row criminals.
21453,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Not only did he disobey orders; \Nhe attempted to instigate an escape.
21454,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Execution was a fair consequence.
21455,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is the real world?
21456,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That is correct.
21457,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I never noticed.
21458,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I hadn't even considered that.
21459,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Well, it doesn't really matter."
21460,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Since this island is still isolated \Nfrom the rest of the world.
21461,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Wait a second.
21462,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If this is the real world, does that mean that Ging is here, on Greed Island?"
21463,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ging?
21464,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ah...
21465,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,So you must be Gon.
21466,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Yeah.
21467,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I was instructed not to go easy on you by your old man.
21468,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I've had enough...
21469,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I don't wanna die!
21470,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Count me out! I'm gone!
21471,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,H-Hey!
21472,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"It's okay, let them leave."
21473,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But then we can't have a match!
21474,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll count as three.
21475,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"You're doing the same thing, so it shouldn't be a problem."
21476,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yeah, that's fine."
21477,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Now it's eight-on-eight.
21478,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll explain the rules.
21479,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The game starts with one outside \Nplayer and seven inside.
21480,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The first team to run out of inside players loses.
21481,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Any player inside the court who's hit by \Na ball thrown by an opponent is out, and must move outside."
21482,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"However, you may bring one player inside \Nthe court again by saying ""Back."""
21483,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"And if the ball hits an area outside \Nthe court, without any players, the opposing team gets the ball."
21484,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Now, the important stuff..."
21485,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The rules regarding hits \Nemploy a cushion effect.
21486,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"For example, if I throw the ball \Nand it hits opposing player A, ricochets, and hits opposing player B \Nbefore hitting the floor, both A and B are out."
21487,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"But if player B in that scenario \Nis able to catch the ball, player A is safe."
21488,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Exactly.
21489,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"But if I throw the ball and it \Nhits opposing player A, ricochets, and hits my teammate, player C, \Nbefore hitting the floor, only player C is out."
21490,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Then if player C catches the ball, \Ndoes that mean player A is out?"
21491,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Indeed.
21492,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Uh...
21493,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Do you have a question?
21494,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If an outside player hits someone \Nwith the ball, is the hit player out?"
21495,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Naturally, they're out."
21496,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But only one player can return to the court using Back.
21497,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"I am Number 0, the ref."
21498,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Let's have a clean game.
21499,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We will now begin the game.
21500,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ready...
21501,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Go!
21502,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You can make the first move.
21503,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You sound quite confident.
21504,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Here's a little greeting, then!"
21505,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You got him!
21506,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Yes! That's one down!
21507,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Good!
21508,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Let's keep this up.
21509,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,There!
21510,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, that's two down!"
21511,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Oh, this is easy."
21512,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, all ready to go..."
21513,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Huh? What did you say?
21514,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm prepared to defeat you now.
21515,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Heh, that's funny."
21516,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Show us what you've got!
21517,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,H-He stopped it with one hand?
21518,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Right, then..."
21519,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Time to launch the counterattack.
21520,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He's standing so far back...
21521,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Is he going to pass it?
21522,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Fast!
21523,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Can I dodge it?
21524,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,No way!
21525,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Can I catch it and live?
21526,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,No!
21527,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll die!
21528,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Death
21529,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,White Goreinu!
21530,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nice rebound.
21531,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Goreinu's outside the court!
21532,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I see...
21533,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nen{\i0
21534,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The {\i0
21535,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This reflects what Goreinu imagined would \Nhappen when he saw Razor's attack.
21536,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He immediately grasped the gap between \Nour opponent's strength and his own.
21537,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He won't easily rid himself of that image.
21538,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It'll be impossible for him to \Nrecover during this match.
21539,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He's done.
21540,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nen{\i0
21541,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nen{\i0
21542,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"However, Back must be used to \Nbring Goreinu inside the court."
21543,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Damn... Is this how it ends?
21544,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"All right, let's move on!"
21545,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That pass is so fast!
21546,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I-It's too fast...
21547,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I can't follow the ball!
21548,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Tsezgerra!
21549,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Behind you!
21550,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It's heavy...
21551,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,As heavy as a bowling ball.
21552,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,This is gonna have insane power.
21553,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"He focused his aura in his back, \Nand avoided a lethal blow."
21554,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Hey, patch him up."
21555,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.
21556,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If a player is unable to continue \Nplaying, they're disqualified."
21557,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"They won't be allowed to play in or outside the court, \Nso keep that in mind."
21558,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Are you okay?
21559,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yeah, I've really lost it..."
21560,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Damn, in overall combat ability,"
21561,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I should still be stronger than they are.
21562,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"But when it comes to the basics like \Nagility and reflexes, they have me beat."
21563,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It's been a while since I've \Nhad to work really hard.
21564,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.
21565,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I don't think I've done any basic \Ntraining in the past few years.
21566,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Ideally, we could knock out \Neveryone on the other team without giving up the ball."
21567,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Hisoka...
21568,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, give me the ball."
21569,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Oh, that's right."
21570,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can \Nretrieve the ball after it hits!"
21571,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Now, do try to entertain me."
21572,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Surely this isn't everything you have.
21573,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Very well...
21574,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Okay, that's three down!"
21575,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"With Back, the other team still has five players!"
21576,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive."
21577,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,All that's left is the order we target them.
21578,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Question for the ref.
21579,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Can the last player inside the court use Back at the second he's hit?
21580,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That's not allowed.
21581,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"For a moment, there would \Nbe zero players in the court, so that team would lose."
21582,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But someone outside the court may use Back at the instant that the last player is hit.
21583,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Okay.
21584,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Hisoka...
21585,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yes, I understand."
21586,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,We leave him for last.
21587,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,He throws a strong ball.
21588,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it."
21589,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Nice and strong!
21590,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If we're lucky, we can take out \N6 and 7 at the same time!"
21591,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Th-They combined?
21592,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You're strong.
21593,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Is that allowed?!
21594,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It is.
21595,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"If you're allowed to combine, \Nare you allowed to split?"
21596,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum \Nnumber of players on the court."
21597,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Now!
21598,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It's my turn to attack again.
21599,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Now we have to retake the ball again.
21600,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,If we're going to stop his ball...
21601,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ken!
21602,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Their {\i0
21603,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,They must have trained hard.
21604,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"But if Razor throws the ball at full strength, won't be enough.{\i0"
21605,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,They must be prepared for casualties \Nwhen they recover the ball and try to defeat him.
21606,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Is it even possible?
21607,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ken{\i0
21608,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That means you won't die.
21609,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,However...
21610,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.
21611,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Here I come,"
21612,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Gon!
21613,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Bring it!
21614,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It won't work! Run away!
21615,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,You'll die!
21616,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ko!
21617,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Gon!
21618,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Where's the ball?
21619,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Crazy...
21620,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It's drilled in there.
21621,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Gon!
21622,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Are you okay?!
21623,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'm just fine!
21624,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,The hell you are...
21625,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Ko{\i0 but my legs couldn't take the impact.
21626,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"However, next time,"
21627,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,I'll catch it!
21628,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Gon is now fired up.
21629,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,G.I. Tutorial
21630,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
21631,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,"Today, we introduce the card Accompany."
21632,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Accompany \N\NWarp all players within 20 meters \Nof caster to city (must have been visited) \Nor player of your choice (must have \Nbeen met inside the game). \N\N[SR][NORM]
21633,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,It lets you warp everyone within 20 meters.
21634,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,What if a player is 21 meters large?
21635,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Continue!
21636,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Next time: Guts x And x Courage.
21637,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Receive!
21638,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Toss!
21639,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Attack!
21640,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,But we're using aura...
21641,A x Heated x Showdown.,69,Because we're Hunters!
21642,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Here I come,"
21643,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon!
21644,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Bring it!
21645,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Ko!
21646,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon!
21647,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Are you okay?!
21648,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm just fine!
21649,Guts x And x Courage.,70,The hell you are...
21650,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Ko{\i0 but my legs couldn't take the impact.
21651,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"However, next time,"
21652,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'll catch it!
21653,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Guts x And x Courage
21654,Guts x And x Courage.,70,An intense dodgeball match has begun.
21655,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon was injured by Razor's throw, but his eyes burn with fire."
21656,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Estimating the ball's likely drop point...
21657,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Play will resume with Team Gon's \Ninside players controlling the ball.
21658,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"But as the ceiling is considered \Nan extension of the floor,"
21659,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon is out.
21660,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm going to use Back.
21661,Guts x And x Courage.,70,But you're...
21662,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm doing it!
21663,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He won't listen to us...
21664,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Fine... However!
21665,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Don't use Back until we're \Ndown to two inside players!
21666,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Got it?
21667,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Now let's start.
21668,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon, get patched up."
21669,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"It isn't against the rules to keep \Npassing the ball like this, is it?"
21670,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That is okay.
21671,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"All right, I'm good now."
21672,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Hey!
21673,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.
21674,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Time for payback, Razor!"
21675,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Take this...
21676,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Black Goreinu!
21677,Guts x And x Courage.,70,So he can swap the black \None with other people?
21678,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You got me good...
21679,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That's what you get.
21680,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You're out of there!
21681,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"He's out, but he's still able to return inside."
21682,Guts x And x Courage.,70,At least we can force him to use up his Back.
21683,Guts x And x Courage.,70,And the ball is in our outside territory.
21684,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Huh?
21685,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What?
21686,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Goreinu!
21687,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You have an interesting ability.
21688,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You should use it wisely.
21689,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Hold on! What was that?!
21690,Guts x And x Courage.,70,There's no rule against passing \Nthe ball to an opponent.
21691,Guts x And x Courage.,70,And you're allowed to hit \Npeople in the face here.
21692,Guts x And x Courage.,70,So his attack was also legal.
21693,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out."
21694,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Once the user's unconscious, \Nthe {\i0"
21695,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"As I suspected, his ability works with \Nhis direct control, not automatically."
21696,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If he regains consciousness, the black ape may begin inside the court."
21697,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"I don't anticipate that happening, though."
21698,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If the interior players are reduced \Nto zero before Goreinu wakes up, the match will be decided."
21699,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It's impossible...
21700,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition"
21701,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Nen{\i0
21702,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Inside the court, it's three versus three."
21703,Guts x And x Courage.,70,But we're obviously outmatched.
21704,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Half our players are gone, and we only have one \Ninjured kid on the outside."
21705,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Our opponents have a solid outside team, \Nso they can attack from anywhere."
21706,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Razor is still inside, \Nwithout needing to use Back."
21707,Guts x And x Courage.,70,And the ball rebounded to our opponents.
21708,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We're at a clear disadvantage!
21709,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Well, then..."
21710,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Who is up next?
21711,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Me?
21712,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What do I do?
21713,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It's impossible! I can't catch that!
21714,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I have to dodge!
21715,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It made a sharp turn?
21716,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Hisoka!
21717,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Bungee Gum!
21718,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That bastard...
21719,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He got us good.
21720,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"He faked going for me, when his real goal was taking out \NBisky and Hisoka in a straight line."
21721,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Actually, he could have gambled that I'd dodge left."
21722,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Had I done that...
21723,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Bisky is out!
21724,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Move to the outside court.
21725,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What?
21726,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Didn't she dodge?
21727,Guts x And x Courage.,70,My own fault.
21728,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Huh?
21729,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"This means your clothes count \Nas part of your body, right?"
21730,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yes.
21731,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I was certain she'd dodged it...
21732,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We're down to two!
21733,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You can't let them get the ball!
21734,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Back!
21735,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon has used Back.
21736,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He may move back inside.
21737,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Can we really trust a kid with this?
21738,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's no ordinary kid...
21739,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's the only one who's even \Ntried to catch Razor's throw.
21740,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Are you all right?
21741,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21742,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Listen to me.
21743,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Do not overdo it!
21744,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21745,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What's one plus one?
21746,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21747,Guts x And x Courage.,70,This is hopeless.
21748,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Okay!
21749,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Beat him, even if it kills you!"
21750,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Osu.
21751,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You okay?
21752,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yep.
21753,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I've discovered something.
21754,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If the ball travels outside the court, \Nit becomes much less powerful."
21755,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Ko{\i0
21756,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Then if we avoid Razor's throws, we will avoid any significant damage."
21757,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Exactly so.
21758,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That won't be a victory.
21759,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Huh?
21760,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Don't be stupid...
21761,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If we can't win no matter what \Nwe do, all this is pointless!"
21762,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"You'd better cool down, stupid."
21763,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Aren't you mad?
21764,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Huh?!
21765,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If you'd dodged left, you could've died."
21766,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Right?
21767,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm really pissed off...
21768,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I won't settle for some cheap win.
21769,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We have to utterly destroy him!
21770,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You must have a plan in mind...
21771,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21772,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I've got this.
21773,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Killua, stand over there."
21774,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball."
21775,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Okay.
21776,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I get it!
21777,Guts x And x Courage.,70,First comes rock!
21778,Guts x And x Courage.,70,His aura just spiked!
21779,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Rock, paper..."
21780,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Rock!
21781,Guts x And x Courage.,70,First comes rock!
21782,Guts x And x Courage.,70,His aura just spiked!
21783,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Rock, paper..."
21784,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Rock!
21785,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Number 13 is out.
21786,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Catching the ball while touching the area \Noutside is illegal and does not count.
21787,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Play will resume with Team Gon's \Noutside players controlling the ball.
21788,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Wow!
21789,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He sent the biggest one flying.
21790,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Damn it...
21791,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That wasn't good enough!
21792,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He looks unhappy...
21793,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's actually upset.
21794,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That kid's really got guts.
21795,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Not enough yet...
21796,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Not enough to defeat the real Razor!
21797,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I need more power!
21798,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Okay, let's do it again."
21799,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Give it to Razor good!
21800,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21801,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"To beat Razor,"
21802,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'll need a lot more power.
21803,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Ren.
21804,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What?
21805,Guts x And x Courage.,70,His aura is immense.
21806,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You may have chosen the wrong sport.
21807,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He has all the time in the \Nworld to build up his power.
21808,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You might want to dodge this one.
21809,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You must be joking.
21810,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Focus all the refined aura into my fist.
21811,Guts x And x Courage.,70,First comes rock!
21812,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Take this, Razor!"
21813,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Rock!
21814,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Paper...
21815,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Rock!
21816,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Perfect!
21817,Guts x And x Courage.,70,No way he'll catch that!
21818,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's receiving it?
21819,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He used his own body to reduce its power.
21820,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Nice move.
21821,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That required perfect timing.
21822,Guts x And x Courage.,70,But he was able to pull it off.
21823,Guts x And x Courage.,70,This man truly is strong.
21824,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Amazing...
21825,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You can do more than just \Ndodge or catch the ball.
21826,Guts x And x Courage.,70,But I doubt that tip will help you.
21827,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"That ball was as strong as Razor's, but it didn't even reach the ceiling."
21828,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He managed to burn off enough \Nmomentum with that receive.
21829,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Now the ball's directly over him!
21830,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Bungee gum.
21831,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Too bad for you.
21832,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"You have to catch the ball, after all."
21833,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out."
21834,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Step to the outside.
21835,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Back.
21836,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Razor has used Back!
21837,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He remains inside.
21838,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Both teams have used Back, \Nand it's three-on-two!"
21839,Guts x And x Courage.,70,The tables have turned!
21840,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Really?
21841,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Our team is the one on the ropes.
21842,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.
21843,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"No, he probably can't even hold \Nthe ball with his right hand."
21844,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.
21845,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He should be starting to feel tired about now.
21846,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"For him to be able to make another, \Nequally strong throw is unlikely."
21847,Guts x And x Courage.,70,So Killua is the only uninjured \Nplayer left on the inside?
21848,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"No, you have it backwards."
21849,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's probably sustained the most damage of all.
21850,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What do you mean?
21851,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"You okay, Gon?"
21852,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Yeah, but we need one more... I think."
21853,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'll put everything into this one.
21854,Guts x And x Courage.,70,All right!
21855,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"This time, end it."
21856,Guts x And x Courage.,70,One more throw...
21857,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I can take it.
21858,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Just hold out!
21859,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"When Gon launched his ball,"
21860,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Nen{\i0
21861,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That's insane.
21862,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You saw the power of that launch...
21863,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Like a cannon opening fire!
21864,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Correct.
21865,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Essentially, he used his bare hands \Nto form the cannon's barrel."
21866,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Nen{\i0 his aura would have become a \Nbarrier against Gon's punch, reducing the power to the ball."
21867,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"In order to avoid weakening the ball,"
21868,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.
21869,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Killua's hands must be in far worse shape than Hisoka's right hand.
21870,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Damn... I'm a fool!
21871,Guts x And x Courage.,70,How could I not be over there?
21872,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I know the technique.
21873,Guts x And x Courage.,70,And I can do it faster than Killua.
21874,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"In the instant before Gon touches the ball, you can apply a lightning-fast coat of \Naura to your hands for protection!"
21875,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Wait!
21876,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Time out!
21877,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Ref, I have a question."
21878,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What is it?
21879,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Can inside players choose \Nto move to the outside?
21880,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"That doesn't violate any rules, but you can't return inside."
21881,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Right... Come here!
21882,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon, if you come outside, \NI can hold the ball for you."
21883,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.
21884,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I doubt he's in any condition \Nto hold the ball for you.
21885,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura in order to protect my hands.
21886,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"I'll hold the ball, and you can \Ntake Razor out from here."
21887,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It's our only way to win.
21888,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We can't do that.
21889,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yeah.
21890,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Wh-Why not?
21891,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Where's the problem?
21892,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It would be a cop-out.
21893,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Huh?
21894,Guts x And x Courage.,70,This isn't the time to worry about that!
21895,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Don't overdo it, pops."
21896,Guts x And x Courage.,70,You took a pretty big hit.
21897,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm doing fine.
21898,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm not hurting as much as you think.
21899,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Then show me your hands.
21900,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm all right.
21901,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Look!
21902,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He can't feel anything but pain.
21903,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I can do this!
21904,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I can take one more ball.
21905,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon, I can do this!"
21906,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It's impossible!
21907,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon, help me convince him."
21908,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I already knew...
21909,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I knew Killua's hands were messed up.
21910,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Tsezgerra-san,"
21911,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"I'm sorry, but I won't move outside."
21912,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I need Killua to hold the ball.
21913,Guts x And x Courage.,70,He's the only one who can do it!
21914,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"If Bisky or Hisoka held it, \NI probably couldn't use my full strength."
21915,Guts x And x Courage.,70,The only reason I can focus \Nwholly on hitting the ball is because Killua's holding it for me.
21916,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"So, got it now, pops?"
21917,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Go get some rest.
21918,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I understand.
21919,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I'm counting on you!
21920,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Hisoka, give me the ball."
21921,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We will now resume the match.
21922,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!"
21923,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Now we're even.
21924,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Brilliant!
21925,Guts x And x Courage.,70,She hit him at just the right angle \Nso the ball would rebound to us.
21926,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Number 2 is out!
21927,Guts x And x Courage.,70,That leaves only...
21928,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Razor alone!
21929,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Gon, we need to regain \Nthe ball from Razor first."
21930,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Of course.
21931,Guts x And x Courage.,70,One sec.
21932,Guts x And x Courage.,70,I understand. That sounds interesting.
21933,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"I'm not sure it'll work, though..."
21934,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Oh, but I would so love to try it."
21935,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Let's give it a shot, Killua."
21936,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Okay.
21937,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Then it's settled.
21938,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Man, you always come up \Nwith the craziest ideas."
21939,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Counting on you, Killua."
21940,Guts x And x Courage.,70,We will resume the match now.
21941,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.
21942,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What sort of team play will emerge when their friendship is backed \Nby the addition of Hisoka?
21943,Guts x And x Courage.,70,G.I. Tutorial
21944,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
21945,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Today, we introduce the card Contact."
21946,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Contact \N\NCommunicate with one target \Nplayer (encountered within the \Ngame) via your Book. (Connection \Nmaintained for a maximum \Nof 3 minutes. May only be \Nbroken by player who uses card.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
21947,Guts x And x Courage.,70,It uses your Binder to let you \Ncontact any player you've met.
21948,Guts x And x Courage.,70,What are you doing?
21949,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Contacting aliens.
21950,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Wow, it worked!"
21951,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Continue!
21952,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Next time: Bargain x And x Deal.
21953,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Let's do this, Killua!"
21954,Guts x And x Courage.,70,"Are you ready, Hisoka?"
21955,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Yes.
21956,Guts x And x Courage.,70,Unite!
21957,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We will now resume the match.
21958,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Razor's Nen beasts...
21959,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Are vanishing.
21960,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He drew the aura he'd \Ndispersed back into himself.
21961,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,So his next throw will use his true strength.
21962,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Bargain x And x Deal
21963,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The match begins once again.
21964,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,What is Gon's plan to retake the ball from Razor?
21965,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I didn't expect I'd need to use this...
21966,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It's been a long time since I've felt this good!
21967,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He threw the ball straight up?
21968,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Does that mean...
21969,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He's going for a spike?
21970,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Hey, over there."
21971,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They're literally going to...
21972,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Combine!
21973,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I see what you're attempting.
21974,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Then it's a contest to determine the winner!
21975,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Their plan is for Gon to catch the ball.
21976,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,For Hisoka to smother it...
21977,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And for Killua to provide support!
21978,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They did it!
21979,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They stopped it!
21980,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Way to go!
21981,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I have to applaud them for that.
21982,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They overcame my power using their wits.
21983,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And the key to their success was that boy Killua.
21984,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gon focused aura on his \Nhands to catch the ball.
21985,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The incredible concentration and focus \Nit took to pull that off deserve my praise.
21986,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"The moment Gon caught it,"
21987,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Hisoka used his power to smother the ball's \Nmomentum so Gon wouldn't drop it.
21988,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Had his technique been less than perfect, the ball would have flown off."
21989,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And Killua...
21990,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"He was stuck between them, \Nacting as both a cushion and a brace, balancing his aura between \Noffensive and defensive."
21991,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If the aura around his body had been too weak, he would have failed to work as a cushion, and all three of them would have taken \Nmajor damage from the ball's impact."
21992,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But if he hadn't used enough aura on his legs, he would have failed to act as a \Nbrace, and the ball would have knocked all three of them outside the court."
21993,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He needed to analyze how to balance his aura between body and legs \Nwithin one-percent accuracy.
21994,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,A feat that demanded both experience and talent.
21995,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But Killua managed to compensate for \Nhis inexperience with his prodigious talent, allowing him to overcome such a difficult task."
21996,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,His talent is scary.
21997,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I didn't reach that point until \NI was in my late twenties...
21998,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I have to beat them before they can combine.
21999,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Right after their attack, my chance will come."
22000,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If I can get them at that moment, \Nthey won't have time to combine."
22001,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Certainly, Gon's throw is powerful, but now I have the power to catch \Nit without being pushed back."
22002,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Then I can pick them off one at a time.
22003,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I need more power...
22004,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,More...
22005,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,More!
22006,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He didn't use his full strength earlier?
22007,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Unbelievable...
22008,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He's a monster.
22009,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Ging, you should be happy."
22010,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,This kid is definitely your son.
22011,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Killua, I'm going all-out."
22012,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You'd better!
22013,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If you don't, I'll smack you!"
22014,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,First comes rock!
22015,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Rock, paper..."
22016,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Rock!
22017,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,More powerful than anticipated.
22018,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But I can catch it!
22019,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"However, the momentum will force me out of bounds!"
22020,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"So catching isn't an option, but I can't dodge, either!"
22021,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Come...
22022,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Trying to receive it again?
22023,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Fool, that'll let Hisoka grab it!"
22024,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I wouldn't be so sure...
22025,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That depends on the direction in which I direct it!
22026,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He bounced it back!
22027,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Gon, dodge!"
22028,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You'll still win!
22029,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"No, he won't dodge."
22030,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That isn't how he wants to win.
22031,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"During this match, I've learned \Nthat much about him."
22032,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He's unconscious?
22033,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Oh, right."
22034,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It was the aura he expended...
22035,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He truly used every ounce of strength.
22036,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You can take pride in this.
22037,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"You've won, Gon."
22038,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Not quite yet.
22039,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Why would you do that?!
22040,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"He desired total victory. \NRight, Gon?"
22041,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He bounced it back again!
22042,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Interesting.
22043,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Are we just rallying now?
22044,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It'll come down to stamina!
22045,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The ball is stuck...
22046,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Bungee Gum possesses the properties \Nof both rubber and gum.
22047,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Razor, catching the ball while touching the \Narea out of bounds is against the rules."
22048,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You're out!
22049,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Which makes Team Gon \Nthe winner of this match!
22050,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,All right!
22051,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"That was amazing, guys!"
22052,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Huh?
22053,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,What happened at the end?
22054,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They beat me good...
22055,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Oh, so Hisoka finished the job."
22056,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"In the end, he stole all the glory."
22057,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It was only possible with all of your help.
22058,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Call this a victory for the team.
22059,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That doesn't sound like you at all.
22060,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You beat me.
22061,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"As promised, we'll leave the city."
22062,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Oh, yeah..."
22063,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That was this game's purpose.
22064,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But first,"
22065,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I will answer your question about Ging.
22066,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Ow!
22067,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Honestly, you were so reckless!"
22068,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Your hands are a total mess.
22069,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Hey, are you listening?"
22070,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The answer is that Ging isn't here.
22071,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Nor do I know where he is.
22072,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Oh...
22073,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Well, I was expecting that."
22074,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But I can tell you some stories that I know.
22075,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Yes, please!"
22076,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"I, too, was a death row convict."
22077,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I was a murderer.
22078,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"I'd been arrested, jailed, and sentenced to die, when Ging hired me to come here."
22079,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Ging taught me it took only one person, one person in the entire world who will trust you, to save you."
22080,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,My son will come here one day.
22081,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"When that happens, give him a good beating."
22082,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
22083,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Don't get too cocky.
22084,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He is my son.
22085,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Then, I'm counting on you, Razor."
22086,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I always thought your old man was insane.
22087,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"He'd spend hours with a death \Nrow convict going on and on about a game he made, like a kid would."
22088,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And then he hired that convict \Nto fight his own son.
22089,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Scum! Who do you think is letting you live?
22090,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Hey...
22091,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You!
22092,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Over there!
22093,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Oh, that..."
22094,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Then, I'm counting on you, Razor."
22095,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It felt like no one had ever \Ncalled me by name before.
22096,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Ging believed in your strength, \Nso he left you to me."
22097,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"And I believed in your strength, which is why I didn't hold back."
22098,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Yeah, but I couldn't have won \Nwithout everyone else."
22099,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That was some good teamwork.
22100,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Yeah.
22101,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Gon, go find Ging."
22102,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Yep!
22103,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,This is the place.
22104,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,A window?
22105,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We can see the shore from here.
22106,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,How do we reach the Sea God's Grotto from here?
22107,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Directly below the point on the \Nsurface the light points to.
22108,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,There's a grotto down there.
22109,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But there isn't any treasure there.
22110,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm sorry I deceived you.
22111,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Really?
22112,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"It's a sacred cavern, so only a few fishermen know the location."
22113,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,All other stories you heard were \Nrumors made up by others.
22114,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Including the stories of treasure.
22115,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But Razor and his gang wouldn't believe us.
22116,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Those who make their living on \Nthe sea can never defile it.
22117,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"So they said before they were all killed, \Ntaking the secret with them."
22118,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Hey...
22119,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"You get that this is a story in a game, right?"
22120,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I can finally see the ocean again from here.
22121,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The sunrise...
22122,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The boats returning with their hauls...
22123,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The water sparkling in many colors.
22124,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"In my mind, this view is the true treasure."
22125,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Patch of Shore \N\NThe entrance to an \Nunderwater cavern known \Nas the Sea God's Grotto. \NThe cavern changes \Nevery time you enter.
22126,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Yes! We got Patch of Shore!
22127,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Let's use Clone to make two copies.
22128,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We're fine with taking the copies.
22129,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Yes, you've earned the right to the original."
22130,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Hisoka, you really don't want anything?"
22131,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"No, it was quite fun."
22132,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Why don't you join us?
22133,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm curious about the Troupe's actions.
22134,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm not interested in collecting cards.
22135,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Should anything else come up, \Nuse Contact to reach me."
22136,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'll use Accompany or Magnetic \NForce to come at once.
22137,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Huh?
22138,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That liar!
22139,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Huh?
22140,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"We haven't used Magnetic Force \Nat all since Hisoka joined, right?"
22141,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That means he already knew about \Nspell cards before he ran into us!
22142,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Killua, there are liars who only lie \Nwhen there's a reason to, and there are liars who also lie without reason."
22143,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You and I are the former.
22144,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He is the latter.
22145,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You won't get anywhere by fretting over it.
22146,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
22147,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It's been a while.
22148,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Do you know who this is?
22149,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Genthru?
22150,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,What do you want?
22151,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"First, I'd like to congratulate you."
22152,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,What are you talking about?
22153,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Don't bother playing dumb.
22154,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I promise to spare your lives.
22155,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"In return, hand over Patch of Shore."
22156,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Don't be ridiculous.
22157,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Well, I am somewhat interested \Nto see if you can beat us."
22158,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If you're willing to deal, come alone to Masadora's entrance in one hour."
22159,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If you don't, we'll take the card by force."
22160,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You cannot escape us.
22161,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We have many copies of Accompany.
22162,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,How?
22163,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"I knew he'd find out, but not this soon!"
22164,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Asta, Amana, Manheim,"
22165,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Nick Cue, Souheil, Kazsule..."
22166,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They were all members of \Nyour party of fifteen.
22167,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Isn't that right?
22168,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Check your Binder.
22169,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They're no longer with us.
22170,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Book!
22171,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,This means they're either dead \Nor no longer in the game...
22172,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Genthru!
22173,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Who are you?
22174,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gon Freecss!
22175,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'll take you on!
22176,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gon?
22177,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,So you're one of those three kids.
22178,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It appears you have Lucky Alexandrite.
22179,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Once I'm done with Tsezgerra, I'll come for you."
22180,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Or do you want to give up the card now?
22181,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You come here this instant!
22182,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'll fight you!
22183,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I also have—
22184,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Tsezgerra, can you move somewhere else?"
22185,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
22186,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,This is Phinks.
22187,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We found him.
22188,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm heading your way.
22189,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Wouldn't it be faster to target the kids?
22190,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They probably have a copy of Patch of Shore.
22191,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But it would be a card created by Clone.
22192,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That's true.
22193,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Once those kids see Tsezgerra \Nsurrender, they'll give up."
22194,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If we go after the kids first,"
22195,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Tsezgerra will have time to recover, \Nand that will just give us more trouble."
22196,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,He is a Single Star Hunter.
22197,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And we don't know what his power is.
22198,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Genthru doesn't know your strength.
22199,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,So he believes that we are carrying \Nthe original Patch of Shore.
22200,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"They want the original card... \Nthey want ""our"" card."
22201,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We'll try to buy as much time as possible.
22202,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Use the time to regain your strength.
22203,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If you want to beat this game, you'll \Nhave no choice but to fight them."
22204,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And you are the only ones \Nwith a chance to win.
22205,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But, Gon..."
22206,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Just now, your actions were \Nboth selfish and foolish."
22207,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If they'd accepted your challenge and come, what would have happened \Nto Killua, given his injuries?"
22208,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"You endangered not only yourself, but your friends too, by losing \Ncontrol of your emotions!"
22209,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm sorry.
22210,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Very well.
22211,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It will all come down to Accompany.
22212,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If we evade their use of Accompany, \Nwe should be able to buy plenty of time."
22213,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But if too much time passes, they may decide to switch and target you."
22214,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I estimate we have a one-week limit.
22215,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Past that, we can't make guarantees."
22216,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,One week...
22217,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That isn't long.
22218,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And that's probably optimistic.
22219,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They may well switch to us after three days.
22220,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'll go with Tsezgerra.
22221,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,What about you guys?
22222,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If we're buying you time, \Nthat implies we have an alliance."
22223,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"No, wait."
22224,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,There is little benefit from an alliance with them.
22225,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The enemy already knows the \Neight of us have teamed up.
22226,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,So we won't be able to act as decoys \Nwhile you take out Genthru.
22227,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"That means leaving the original versions of the last two cards they seek,"
22228,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"#2 and #75, with any one \Nparty would be dangerous."
22229,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,So my offer to buy time isn't an alliance.
22230,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I'm offering a deal.
22231,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,A deal?
22232,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Three weeks...
22233,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That's the amount of time we can buy.
22234,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If we succeed, will you give \Nus #75, Lucky Alexandrite?"
22235,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That doesn't make sense.
22236,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,You just said one week was the limit.
22237,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That's assuming we stay on the run.
22238,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If necessary, I can force a stalemate of sorts."
22239,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,I see.
22240,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"But for #75, we could just \Ntell you how to obtain it."
22241,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"No, we already know how."
22242,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But Goreinu and the rest of us have few empty slots left.
22243,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It's no longer reasonable to turn \Nall our cards over to the villagers.
22244,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Three weeks.
22245,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,That isn't enough time for \NKillua's hands to heal.
22246,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,And it certainly isn't enough to close the \Ngap between Genthru's abilities and ours.
22247,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Which means we should use the \Ntime to come up with a plan.
22248,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Exactly.
22249,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Devise a scenario in which \Nyou can defeat Genthru.
22250,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Identify the required circumstances, \Nand prepare to carry out that plan."
22251,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Got it.
22252,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Good...
22253,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,We'll leave to delay Team Genthru now.
22254,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Keep this in mind, Gon..."
22255,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,They've already killed over \Nfifty players in this game.
22256,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"If you want to beat the game, \Nyou'll have to fight them."
22257,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Accompany on!
22258,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,To Masadora!
22259,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Three weeks... That isn't much time.
22260,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Killua, you focus on healing and thinking of a plan to defeat Genthru."
22261,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Right.
22262,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Gon, you train with me."
22263,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,The first necessity is that you be \Nable to avoid his Little Flower.
22264,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Osu!
22265,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gon has won his match against Razor.
22266,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,But the bombers remain stronger \Nfighters than Gon's group.
22267,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Will they be able to devise a viable plan?
22268,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,G.I. Tutorial
22269,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
22270,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Today, we introduce the card Clone."
22271,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Clone \N\NTransform into a random card \Nselected from the restricted slots \Nof one target player. (If target has \Nempty restricted slots or max of \Nselected card has been reached, \NClone is used up without transforming. \N\N[LR][NORM]"
22272,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,It transforms into one random card from the player's restricted slots.
22273,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gold Dust Girl \N\NA girl who releases golden dust. \NOne bath a day will net 500G. \NVery shy and quiet.
22274,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Wow, Gold Dust Girl!"
22275,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Gain!
22276,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Continue!
22277,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Next time: Chase x And x Chance.
22278,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Battera!
22279,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Sabazushi!
22280,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Battera.
22281,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,Barazushi.
22282,Bargain x And x Deal.,71,"Zushi, Zushi, osu!"
22283,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Where is our friend?
22284,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.
22285,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He's just up ahead.
22286,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.
22287,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're willing to pay any price he asks.
22288,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it."
22289,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I understand.
22290,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise..."
22291,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Chase x And x Chance
22292,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's him.
22293,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How did you find him?
22294,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Hell if I'll tell you, fool."
22295,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"You in the shadows, was it through your power?"
22296,Chase x And x Chance.,72,En{\i0
22297,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Are you some kind of freak?
22298,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I recently completed a very entertaining battle.
22299,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I'm quite sensitive at the moment...
22300,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"To calm myself down,"
22301,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I rather feel like messing up \Na complete stranger.
22302,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Damn.
22303,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Come on out.
22304,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Zetsu{\i0
22305,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"No, it was perfect."
22306,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This guy is just insanely perceptive.
22307,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Here is Troupe member #4.
22308,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"In other words, your replacement."
22309,Chase x And x Chance.,72,My name is Kalluto.
22310,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"I cannot tell you how my power works, \Nbut we found him by using it."
22311,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Ah...
22312,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You look very appetizing as well.
22313,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Be careful.
22314,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He certainly isn't picky.
22315,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Hisoka, you'd better succeed."
22316,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You people are so tedious.
22317,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"I certainly shall, for my own benefit."
22318,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Are you serious about fighting the boss?
22319,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Of course I am.
22320,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Would you prefer that I survive, \Nor that Chrollo survives?"
22321,Chase x And x Chance.,72,A stupid question.
22322,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Once you finish your job here, \Nyou can die, for all I care."
22323,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"And if I kill Chrollo, then what?"
22324,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That would be impossible.
22325,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But I'll answer your question.
22326,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I would pursue you to the ends \Nof the Earth to kill you.
22327,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I like the sound of that...
22328,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Our objective is to obtain Breath of Archangel, \Ncurrently monopolized by Team Genthru."
22329,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"We must force them to transform a card, or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher."
22330,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And that's where Team Gon comes in.
22331,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"While they may not have the \Nstrength to win outright, they are highly likely to deal serious \Ndamage to a member of Team Genthru."
22332,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,"
22333,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Voucher\N\NA voucher that can be \Nexchanged for Breath \Nof Archangel. Can only \Nbe obtained when \NBreath of Archangel \Nhas attained its card \Ntransformation limit. our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.
22334,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Breath of Archangel \N\NAn angel that cures any \Nmortal injury or terminal \Nillness with one breath. \NBut angel only appears once.
22335,Chase x And x Chance.,72,After that...
22336,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We only need Lucky Alexandrite!
22337,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"And if we can buy three weeks for those kids, they'll trade the card to us!"
22338,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Yes.
22339,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Right, it's time."
22340,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Let's get going.
22341,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Cards Needed\N\NPatch of Shore\NLucky Alexandrite
22342,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I believe I told you to come alone.
22343,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"We weren't able to make a decision,"
22344,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Cards Needed\N\NBreath of Archangel\NLucky Alexandrite\NBlue Planet so we kept discussing it on our way here.
22345,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And we've finally reached a consensus.
22346,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We choose to fight!
22347,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Levy on!
22348,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22349,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Antokiba!
22350,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Book.
22351,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Check your cards.
22352,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Book!
22353,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It's okay.
22354,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They only stole some useless \Ncards from my free slots.
22355,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Same here.
22356,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I didn't lose anything important.
22357,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Guess that settles it.
22358,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We take their cards and kill them.
22359,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They'll put up a fight.
22360,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Huh?
22361,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I don't know what's happened to them...
22362,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But their resolve was written all over their faces.
22363,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Six copies of Accompany, twenty-four of Return, nine copies of Castle Gate, and two of Magnetic Force."
22364,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I spent all our money on them.
22365,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, then we'll meet up in three days."
22366,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Use that time to earn money \Nand buy the cards we need.
22367,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Got it.
22368,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Do you think they'll come after us?
22369,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Not immediately.
22370,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We now have nearly twice the number \Nof Accompany cards as Genthru.
22371,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that."
22372,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Just you watch, Genthru..."
22373,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.
22374,Chase x And x Chance.,72,A Few Days Later
22375,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Gyo!
22376,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Too slow!
22377,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.
22378,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Act the second you feel my touch!
22379,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Osu!
22380,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Too slow.
22381,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Osu!
22382,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You're still too slow!
22383,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Osu!
22384,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, let's take a ten-minute break."
22385,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Next, we'll start Emitter training."
22386,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Osu.
22387,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He's building his stamina...
22388,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"But in the mere two weeks we have left,"
22389,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I can only help him bolster his defense.
22390,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We need another weapon before we can fight.
22391,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Emitter training, level two."
22392,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Elevation!
22393,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"You must maintain this stance, \Nwhile staying perfectly still, and only by releasing aura."
22394,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If you can elevate around \Nat least that high, you pass."
22395,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Okay!
22396,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"That training is a lot harder, given that it's only a level higher."
22397,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Naturally... Because this is \Nreally level-five training.
22398,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Five?
22399,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Are you sure you should skip levels like that?
22400,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Well, it's a gamble."
22401,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted \Nthe three weeks we were given."
22402,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If we followed the proper sequence, \Nhe could reach level three easily."
22403,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But that wouldn't do him any \Ngood in actual combat.
22404,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He needs an Emitter attack that \Ncan push an opponent back several meters with a direct hit.
22405,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It must be that strong for \Nhim to use it as a weapon.
22406,Chase x And x Chance.,72,So you jumped to level five...
22407,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"But even if he clears the training, the ability to send enemies flying \Nisn't a desicively lethal weapon."
22408,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Exactly right.
22409,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It's only meant to give him more options.
22410,Chase x And x Chance.,72,So have you made any progress on a plan?
22411,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"First, can you tell me what your power is?"
22412,Chase x And x Chance.,72,My job will be easier with that information.
22413,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I'll introduce you to my power.
22414,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.
22415,Chase x And x Chance.,72,She specializes in providing \Nmassages of pure pleasure.
22416,Chase x And x Chance.,72,She'll burn off excess fat and guide both \Nyour body and your soul to paradise.
22417,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"When her aura, transformed into \Nspecial lotion, is applied to the skin, it makes your skin look younger."
22418,Chase x And x Chance.,72,She can also use acupressure massage \Nto cleanse your body internally.
22419,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills... \Nany anomaly you have will vanish!"
22420,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's it?
22421,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Of course not!
22422,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"She can also do chiropractic massages, \Nmeditative massages, rolling massages..."
22423,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And there's still much more!
22424,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Are you an idiot?!
22425,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's totally worthless!
22426,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What are you talking about?!
22427,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's the most useful power in the world!
22428,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This is why you're just a stupid old hag!
22429,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I dare you to say that again!
22430,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Return on!
22431,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Soufrabi!
22432,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Wait up!
22433,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Was it them again?
22434,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Damn, they're getting pretty blatant..."
22435,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're definitely targeting us!
22436,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That isn't the issue.
22437,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How do they know where to find us?
22438,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they were using Accompany or Magnetic \NForce to move straight to us, we'd know, but that isn't the case."
22439,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"They're using hit and run tactics, \Nthen making clean escapes."
22440,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"We immediately move to a different location, \Nbut before long, they find us."
22441,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Nen{\i0
22442,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they aren't using a spell, \Nlike homing or tracking,"
22443,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Nen{\i0
22444,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We can't defend against that!
22445,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What do we do?
22446,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We'll just have to use some force.
22447,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's one copy of Accompany...
22448,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Take all his C-rank cards.
22449,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder..."
22450,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He hasn't met them before.
22451,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Then he's clean.
22452,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Hey, have you heard of the bombers?"
22453,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Yes, I've heard the rumors..."
22454,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We are the bombers.
22455,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I just set a bomb on you.
22456,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish."
22457,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If you don't want to die, \Nbring me the cards I request."
22458,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Hey, here's another Accompany!"
22459,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I'll set Steal in here....
22460,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Kess \N\NTsezgerra \N\NRodriot
22461,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Uh-oh!
22462,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Too bad!
22463,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You're out!
22464,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Crap...
22465,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What are those bastards thinking?!
22466,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're camping outside the spell card store.
22467,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And they're attacking every player who \Nwalks out with newly bought cards.
22468,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Contact \N\NCommunicate with one target \Nplayer (encountered within the \Ngame) via your Book. (Connection \Nmaintained for a maximum \Nof 3 minutes. May only be \Nbroken by player who uses card.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
22469,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This is pure speculation.
22470,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But they must be aware of me.
22471,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They've realized that someone new is \Nproviding cards to Team Tsezgerra.
22472,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"So to flush me out, they check the binders of \Nanyone who exits the store, disposing of everyone who's met one of you."
22473,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They also steal their cards.
22474,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're primarily focused on obtaining \NAccompany and Magnetic Force.
22475,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And any players that they free \Nonce cleared of suspicion are forced to collect cards for them.
22476,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"By eliminating suspects and taking their cards, they also cut off our supply."
22477,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're killing three birds with one stone.
22478,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Got it.
22479,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We'll try to track their movements.
22480,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Get away from there and \Nwait for us to contact you.
22481,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Silent Worker: Fly on the Job
22482,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.
22483,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, next we check their cards."
22484,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Together, those three have sixteen copies of Accompany \Nand two of Magnetic Force."
22485,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's a significant increase...
22486,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"At this pace, they'll catch up \Nto us in four to five days."
22487,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But we expected that.
22488,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're saying they won't move \Nuntil they have enough cards.
22489,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Everything is going well.
22490,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Twelve days left.
22491,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It's not working...
22492,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Listen to me.
22493,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"While training, see yourself firing a water pistol."
22494,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"You build up aura within your body, \Nthen shoot it from your palm!"
22495,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"The greater your power, \Nthe stronger the aura you fire."
22496,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You want to release all the aura \Nyou've kept closed up inside.
22497,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"The total amount of refined \Naura you apply to the attack, and the speed, power, and timing \Nyou apply to the release..."
22498,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You need all of those elements \Nto land the attack you'll require.
22499,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It's too hard!
22500,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I just don't get how you push the aura \Nin your body out of your hand...
22501,Chase x And x Chance.,72,He hasn't made any progress for ten days.
22502,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Maybe you should have let \Nhim start from level two.
22503,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We still have ten more days...
22504,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.
22505,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal."
22506,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite, they'll only be missing two cards."
22507,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We still need over thirty...
22508,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We can just take them from Genthru by force.
22509,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Gon would never accept that...
22510,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And we still have to figure out \Nhow to defeat Genthru first.
22511,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's true.
22512,Chase x And x Chance.,72,So is this big enough?
22513,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Yeah.
22514,Chase x And x Chance.,72,A Few Days Later
22515,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.
22516,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If you total their Accompany, Return, and Magnetic Force cards, \Nthey only have forty-five cards."
22517,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Now they can't evade us.
22518,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.
22519,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22520,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Tsezgerra!
22521,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're on the move!
22522,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're coming our way at an incredible speed!
22523,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We move according to the plan!
22524,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22525,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Masadora!
22526,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22527,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Tsezgerra!
22528,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22529,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Soufrabi!
22530,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22531,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Tsezgerra!
22532,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22533,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Masadora!
22534,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22535,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Tsezgerra!
22536,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I'm out now.
22537,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Barry!
22538,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Roger that.
22539,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Accompany on!
22540,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Soufrabi!
22541,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Damn, we only have five days left..."
22542,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Don't you have any advice that \Ncould help him break through?
22543,Chase x And x Chance.,72,The sensation of aura flowing through the body is different for everyone.
22544,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If I give him advice from my own perception \Nand he makes incorrect assumptions, it could end up hurting more than helping."
22545,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How many do we have left?
22546,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Seven copies of Accompany.
22547,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They aren't coming...
22548,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Did they give up?
22549,Chase x And x Chance.,72,No way.
22550,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're taking their time to throw us off.
22551,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If we run out of Accompany, \Nwe'll have to use Return."
22552,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Understood.
22553,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.
22554,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How's it going over there?
22555,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Let's find out.
22556,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Contact on.
22557,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Goreinu.
22558,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This is Tsezgerra.
22559,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How's it going there?
22560,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You were right.
22561,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Sub and Bara have appeared.
22562,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Most likely the real ones.
22563,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're speculating that I'll try to buy \Ncards while they're playing tag.
22564,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Which means it's Genthru and a couple \Nof fakes that are chasing you.
22565,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!
22566,Chase x And x Chance.,72,The same trick won't work again.
22567,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Right now, Genthru is alone, \Nwhile there are four of us."
22568,Chase x And x Chance.,72,This is our chance!
22569,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"No, I would prefer better odds for a fight."
22570,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We'll stick to the original plan.
22571,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Here they come.
22572,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're back on the run!
22573,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Gon...
22574,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Time's up.
22575,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Your training's over.
22576,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We still have five days!
22577,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Change in plans.
22578,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I came up with a plan for defeating them.
22579,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But... But...
22580,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Uh, well..."
22581,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I think I've almost got it.
22582,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Maybe...
22583,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"No, it isn't happening."
22584,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And I can't use an unreliable \Ntechnique in my plan...
22585,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Give up.
22586,Chase x And x Chance.,72,So the plan is...
22587,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To use this.
22588,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Huh?
22589,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You'll have to learn this the hard way.
22590,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Until you get it down to perfection.
22591,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're out of Accompany cards...
22592,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Use Return!
22593,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Return on!
22594,Chase x And x Chance.,72,To Aiai!
22595,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're out of Accompany cards?
22596,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're finally getting close.
22597,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Sub, Bara..."
22598,Chase x And x Chance.,72,How's it going? Catch anyone?
22599,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Only one, and it was someone new to the game."
22600,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Word's out that the bombers are hunting players around here, so everyone's staying away."
22601,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Could he have been someone \Nwe already disposed of?
22602,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Perhaps...
22603,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, come back."
22604,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I'm in Soufrabi now.
22605,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They're out of bullets.
22606,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Leave \N\NSend one target player \Noff the island. \N\N[SR][NORM]
22607,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're finally down to our last card.
22608,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they follow us outside the game, \Nwe can fend them off at the mansion."
22609,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"If they don't follow us, we just have \Nto wait until the time limit is up."
22610,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It's perfect...
22611,Chase x And x Chance.,72,All that's left is choosing the \Nthree to keep for winning.
22612,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.
22613,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Okay, let's go!"
22614,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Leave!
22615,Chase x And x Chance.,72,No one's here.
22616,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What's going on?
22617,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Weren't armed guards standing by?
22618,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Sabazushi, where are you?"
22619,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Answer if you're there!
22620,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Sabazushi!
22621,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Keep it down...
22622,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I was taking a nap.
22623,Chase x And x Chance.,72,A nap?
22624,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What happened to everyone else?
22625,Chase x And x Chance.,72,They left.
22626,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.
22627,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We received an intermediary fee \Nand a cancellation fee.
22628,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But I stayed behind because I \Nthought I should inform you.
22629,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Canceled?
22630,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Mr. Battera!
22631,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What is the meaning of this?!
22632,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're so close!
22633,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're close to beating the game!
22634,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It doesn't matter...
22635,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Doesn't matter anymore.
22636,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Doesn't matter?!
22637,Chase x And x Chance.,72,That's crap!
22638,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What about all the time and effort we've spent?
22639,Chase x And x Chance.,72,My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.
22640,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You can do whatever you want with the cards.
22641,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"So now, just leave me alone..."
22642,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Damn!
22643,Chase x And x Chance.,72,What's going on?
22644,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I don't know.
22645,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Why did this happen?
22646,Chase x And x Chance.,72,We're free to kill them out here.
22647,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Since their ring data won't disappear.
22648,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his \Nfriends the time that they promised.
22649,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But awaiting them was a \Nsituation they didn't expect.
22650,Chase x And x Chance.,72,G.I. Tutorial
22651,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
22652,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Today, we introduce the card Fake."
22653,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Fake \N\NChange Fake into any card type from 001 to 099. \NThe new card can be placed in a restricted pocket. \NBut it will not count toward Book completion, \Nand cannot be transformed into an item. \NIt also will not count toward card limit. \N\N[SR][NORM]"
22654,Chase x And x Chance.,72,It can transform into any card from 001 to 099.
22655,Chase x And x Chance.,72,But it doesn't count toward binder completion.
22656,Chase x And x Chance.,72,And it can't be transformed into an item.
22657,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Funny face!
22658,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity.
22659,Chase x And x Chance.,72,"Hey, Gon, want to see my special attack?"
22660,Chase x And x Chance.,72,I sure do!
22661,Chase x And x Chance.,72,You'll have to wait till next week!
22662,Chase x And x Chance.,72,Are you insane?
22663,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Tsezgerra \NRodriot \NBarry \NKess
22664,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Today is the tenth day.
22665,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"If they don't return, their data will be erased."
22666,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Well, I guess we have to wait \Nfor Goreinu to contact us."
22667,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yes! I got it!
22668,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Look, I've got this down pat."
22669,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?
22670,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,No!
22671,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"You might have it down, but you're \Nstill off by a tenth of a second."
22672,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.
22673,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Now start!
22674,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Man...
22675,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
22676,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Insanity x And x Sanity
22677,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,It's Goreinu.
22678,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Sorry to keep you waiting.
22679,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What's going on?
22680,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?
22681,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yeah.
22682,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I can tell you now they won't be returning.
22683,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why not?
22684,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Genthru's team is camping the starting point.
22685,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We decided beforehand that they \Nwouldn't return to the game until I sent an all clear signal.
22686,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I understand.
22687,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But their card data will disappear.
22688,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.
22689,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?
22690,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They'll notice if none of the four \Nhave any important cards!
22691,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?"
22692,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Yeah, in five more minutes, \Ntheir card data will be wiped."
22693,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Essentially, they'll be out of it."
22694,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10."
22695,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But do you really think they've given up?
22696,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Absolutely.
22697,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Given that they took Battera and ran.
22698,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,It was a desperate attempt to \Nkeep us from the reward.
22699,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But they spent years collecting \Nthose ninety-six cards.
22700,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Also, I'm wondering why Battera \Nwould send his guards packing."
22701,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,No idea... Guess something happened.
22702,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,No point in speculating about it now.
22703,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Oh, it's 3:10."
22704,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Time's up.
22705,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yay!
22706,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!"
22707,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Fake?
22708,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Yeah, we switched about thirty of their \Nninety-six cards with fakes."
22709,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm the one actually holding \Nthe ninety-six cards.
22710,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"For such a cautious man, this is the \Nbiggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life."
22711,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,So I want to make sure it pays off.
22712,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"I'm sorry, but I won't be able to \Nhelp you face Genthru's crew."
22713,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Understood.
22714,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,When do you want us to give you the card?
22715,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.
22716,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Good luck.
22717,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany \N\NWarp all players within \N20 meters of caster to city \N(must have been visited) \Nor player of your choice \N(must have been met \Ninside the game). \N\N[SR][NORM]
22718,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Now it's time to go after those kids.
22719,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"It wasn't in the plan, but we can \Nget Patch of Shore from them."
22720,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"First, we need more copies of Accompany."
22721,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Okay.
22722,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They're on the move.
22723,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Where are you right now?
22724,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Near Soufrabi.
22725,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They're heading toward Masadora.
22726,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Once they're prepared, they'll come for you."
22727,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Are you ready?
22728,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Absolutely.
22729,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We have you guys to thank.
22730,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We need more time.
22731,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.
22732,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Gon!
22733,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Did you let our conversation \Ndistract you and lose track?
22734,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Please explain what this is about.
22735,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"I realize that I was being intrusive, but I took a look."
22736,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Your daughter?
22737,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Or perhaps your granddaughter?
22738,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,My lover.
22739,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She'd been hospitalized for a long time.
22740,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She was in a coma.
22741,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"A few days ago, she passed away in her sleep."
22742,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"I suppose she didn't want people \Nthinking she wanted my money, because she returned every gift I gave her."
22743,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But she loved this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.
22744,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,All we ever needed was one other.
22745,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We swore that we would never be apart...
22746,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Until the accident that put her into a sleep from \Nwhich she'd never wake...
22747,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Indeed...
22748,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She appeared to only be sleeping...
22749,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Greed Island{\i0
22750,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Breath of Archangel \N\NAn angel that cures any \Nmortal injury or terminal \Nillness with one breath. \NBut angel only appears once.
22751,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"If I beat that game, I could obtain the one thing that I need most, like a dream come true."
22752,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I was prepared to spend my \Nfortune on copies of that game.
22753,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But it doesn't matter any longer...
22754,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,It doesn't matter...
22755,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,The kids have four copies of \NAccompany among them.
22756,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We have six.
22757,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Shall we go, then?"
22758,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yeah.
22759,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Whenever you're ready.
22760,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.
22761,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Assuming we need to resort to force.
22762,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Sub, take the slant-eyed kid."
22763,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Bara, you take the girl."
22764,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany on!
22765,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Gon!
22766,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What do you want?
22767,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Don't be so hostile.
22768,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We're here to propose a deal.
22769,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,A deal?
22770,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We aren't interested!
22771,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Right, don't let them notice that we've been waiting for them, \Ncompletely prepared."
22772,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,It's not a bad deal.
22773,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.
22774,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What is it?
22775,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Interested now?
22776,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Stop! Talk from where you are!
22777,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Yes, that's good."
22778,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We must act like we're at a \Nsignificant disadvantage.
22779,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We have to convince them that we're being forced into this position.
22780,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,It's quite simple.
22781,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf, \Nthen everyone returns to the real world."
22782,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And we'll split Battera's reward.
22783,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I find that hard to believe.
22784,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We've had a change of heart.
22785,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And Tsezgerra has already left the game.
22786,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But that doesn't prove that \Nhe agreed to your offer.
22787,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You have a valid point.
22788,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Then, what now?"
22789,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Do you want to die?
22790,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Stop whining, and hand over your cards!"
22791,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Otherwise, we'll slaughter you!"
22792,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You've revealed your true colors.
22793,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book!
22794,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany on!
22795,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,To Soufrabi!
22796,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Three more times.
22797,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Two more times.
22798,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,One more time...
22799,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Return \N\NWarp to a city \Nof your choice. \N(Must be a city \Nyou have visited.) \N\N[LR][NORM]
22800,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Return on!
22801,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,To Masadora!
22802,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Masadora?
22803,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Are they trying to obtain more spell cards?
22804,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They might try to escape to the \Nreal world through the port.
22805,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany on.
22806,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Gon!
22807,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They're not here.
22808,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Are they hiding and concealing their presences?
22809,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Check at the store.
22810,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We don't want to let them buy any spell cards.
22811,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They haven't been here.
22812,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Did they head for the port?
22813,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Tsk, guess we have no choice."
22814,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany on!
22815,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Gon!
22816,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Don't lose sight of them!
22817,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We're out of Accompany cards!
22818,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Now why don't you give up, \Nand hand over your cards?"
22819,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,No way!
22820,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,We'll never let you have them!
22821,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Everything's gone to plan.
22822,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,They mean to fight us one-on-one.
22823,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"If we have to hand over our \Ncards, we'd rather fight!"
22824,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Wait, Gon!"
22825,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Damn...
22826,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Good.
22827,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Now we only need to separate them.
22828,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Bisky, you run for it!"
22829,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,B-But...
22830,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Just run!
22831,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Wait!
22832,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Hey, you aren't getting away."
22833,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm counting on you guys.
22834,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're up against me!
22835,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You know that I'm the Bomber?
22836,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I heard it from Tsezgerra.
22837,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And who told you how my power works?
22838,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Incredible.
22839,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,That moment was enough for him to know what I'm watching out for and why...
22840,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,This is the difference in experience between us!
22841,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,There aren't too many people who know about my power \Nand are still alive.
22842,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book!
22843,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I can't let him control things.
22844,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I don't like people just taking \Ncards from other players!
22845,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,So let's make a deal.
22846,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Whoever surrenders first has \Nto give up all his cards.
22847,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You seem to have the wrong idea.
22848,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're in no position to make demands.
22849,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,This is your last chance to make a deal.
22850,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Otherwise, you're nothing more than a thief."
22851,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'd rather die than hand \Nover my cards to a thief!
22852,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"You can kill me, but I still \Nwon't take out my binder!"
22853,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're insane.
22854,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And I don't mean my kind of insane.
22855,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Very well.
22856,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You have a deal.
22857,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book.
22858,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm holding one hundred thirty-one cards.
22859,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I have ninety-seven of the restricted slot cards.
22860,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I have one hundred and two cards.
22861,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And seventy-one of the restricted slot cards.
22862,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book.
22863,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"You have #2 and #75, correct?"
22864,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yeah.
22865,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book.
22866,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,That's all I need.
22867,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,An excellent show of {\i0
22868,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"But clearly, he has much \Nroom for improvement."
22869,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Offense is the strongest defense.
22870,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're strong enough that a single explosion won't be \Nenough to finish you off.
22871,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,So stay on the attack!
22872,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,This kid has skill.
22873,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But his use of aura is sloppy at best.
22874,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Not sure why he was so confident.
22875,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"At this point, you're nowhere near his level."
22876,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You won't be able to deal significant damage.
22877,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But continue to attack!
22878,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Because he will still defeat you.
22879,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You still haven't answered my question.
22880,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Who told you about my power?
22881,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Well, it isn't important now."
22882,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,My point is that I don't need my ability to deal with you.
22883,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,All according to plan.
22884,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Once he's seen how much stronger he is, we'll begin to lure him into our trap!"
22885,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Osu!
22886,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,That's how I'd like to respond...
22887,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But I don't like the idea of \Nbeing totally manhandled.
22888,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'll make him use his power...
22889,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'll carry out the plan afterwards!
22890,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Looks like you need a little more pain!
22891,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Use your power.
22892,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I have a surprise for you!
22893,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I see what you're thinking.
22894,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I won't use it!
22895,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Damned kid!
22896,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She's faster than I expected.
22897,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Book!
22898,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She should be out of teleportation spells.
22899,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What's she doing?
22900,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,She used Transform to hide \Nit as a different card?
22901,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany on!
22902,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,To Soufrabi!
22903,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Accompany?
22904,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why?
22905,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I don't get it...
22906,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why would you go to all this \Ntrouble to be alone with me?
22907,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,One reason...
22908,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.
22909,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Huh?
22910,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I have no idea what you're talking about.
22911,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're such a fool...
22912,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm telling you that I'm stronger.
22913,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Damned brat!
22914,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Your attacks are too weak...
22915,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You can't defeat me!
22916,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I won't hold back...
22917,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,So don't blame me.
22918,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,That's what I was going to say.
22919,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"I was being nice, so I let you hit me once."
22920,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.
22921,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And I end up killing my opponents!
22922,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Oh, you're alive?"
22923,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I'm impressed.
22924,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why would you... hide your power?
22925,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Two reasons...
22926,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...
22927,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"And more than anything, I hate the way I look."
22928,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Too macho!
22929,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Don't you agree?
22930,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,He can't hear me anymore?
22931,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I have a slight advantage in martial \Nskill and physical strength.
22932,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But he has me beat in aura capacity.
22933,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I probably won't be able to hurt \Nhim with any normal attack.
22934,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Which makes him perfect to experiment on.
22935,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Damn...
22936,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I felt that hit inside my head.
22937,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I can't afford to fool around.
22938,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Wrong.
22939,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Experiment #1...
22940,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Lightning Palm!
22941,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Lightning Palm
22942,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.
22943,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.
22944,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Okay.
22945,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Experiment #2...
22946,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,A yo-yo?
22947,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Let's do this.
22948,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What's he up to?
22949,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,What's that thing made of?
22950,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.
22951,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"It weighs around fifty kilograms, so it packs quite a punch!"
22952,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Whoa!
22953,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Damn...
22954,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Between the weight and centrifugal \Nforce, that really hurts."
22955,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,He always leaves his right side exposed when I attack a certain way!
22956,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed, he'll make the same mistake!"
22957,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,My chance!
22958,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,There!
22959,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Yes!
22960,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Time to crush you!
22961,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Oh?
22962,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?
22963,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Wow, you're still conscious?"
22964,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Did you know that when you kick me, you raise your \Nguarding arm on the other side?"
22965,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You're creating your own blind spot.
22966,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,He used my blind spot to pull \Nout a yo-yo and attack?
22967,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Then your defensive habit...
22968,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Was a fake to make you \Nkick me with your left leg.
22969,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,And when you released your first yo-yo...
22970,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I knew you picked up something to throw at me.
22971,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why did you use Accompany to \Ndraw me away from the others?
22972,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"To make you focus on a one-on-one chance, \Nso you'd lose track of your surroundings."
22973,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I don't believe it..
22974,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You set three traps during that brief exchange?
22975,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Three?
22976,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You must be joking...
22977,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Every move I made was a trap.
22978,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Experiment complete!
22979,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Both work.
22980,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Why won't you accept your fate?
22981,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You can't beat me.
22982,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,No way.
22983,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I...
22984,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I haven't lost yet!
22985,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I was mistaken.
22986,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I take back what I said.
22987,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,You are strong...
22988,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I will show you my power.
22989,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"This battle is mental, not physical."
22990,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,I must crush his will.
22991,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"His will to fight, his will to stand, his will to resist."
22992,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat..."
22993,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"To win, I must swallow my \Npride and play it smart."
22994,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Let me demonstrate that all your hard \Nwork and confidence mean nothing!
22995,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Here he comes.
22996,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,The devilish man has unleashed his true power.
22997,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Can Gon emerge victorious?
22998,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,G.I. Tutorial
22999,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Coming up, it's the \NGreed Island Tutorial!"
23000,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel."
23001,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Breath of Archangel \N\NAn angel that cures any \Nmortal injury or terminal \Nillness with one breath. \NBut angel only appears once.
23002,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,A card that can cure injury and disease.
23003,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Mito-san used this all the time.
23004,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Huh?
23005,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"Boo-boos, begone!"
23006,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Continue!
23007,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Next time: Victor x And x Loser.
23008,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Ow! That hurts...
23009,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,"What's wrong, Killua?"
23010,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,My tooth hurts...
23011,Insanity x And x Sanity.,73,Good kids always brush their teeth.
23012,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I must crush his will.
23013,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"His will to fight, his will to stand, his will to resist..."
23014,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Let me demonstrate that all your hard \Nwork and confidence mean nothing!
23015,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Victor x And x Loser
23016,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He's fast...
23017,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I had no time to dodge!
23018,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But I can still block his attacks!
23019,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Oh? He used {\i0
23020,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"The moment I grasped his arm, he focused his aura there to block my attack."
23021,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Idiot!
23022,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You think you've outwitted me now?!
23023,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What's the matter?
23024,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That was just a body blow.
23025,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If you focus your aura where I grab you, you leave yourself open everywhere else."
23026,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It's futile...
23027,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"In fact, you're only making \Nit harder on yourself."
23028,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Bisky was right!
23029,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You won't be smiling much longer!
23030,Victor x And x Loser.,74,One more hit to send you to hell!
23031,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Impossible!
23032,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That was the hardest hit so far!
23033,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He shouldn't have been able to counter.
23034,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"But since he did, that means he \Nkept the damage to a minimum."
23035,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"In other words, he blocked me \Nwithout relying on aura."
23036,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?
23037,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"No, that wasn't a guess."
23038,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Hey, Bisky..."
23039,Victor x And x Loser.,74,How does Genthru avoid being \Nburned by his own bombs?
23040,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That's quite simple.
23041,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He shrouds his hand in aura that's \Nstronger than the explosion.
23042,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Oh... I get it.
23043,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It's a technique that requires \Na large aura reserve.
23044,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This is a good opportunity.
23045,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"By now, you should be able to tell."
23046,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Excellent reaction!
23047,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You've almost perfected {\i0
23048,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"One more time, then."
23049,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Huh?
23050,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Could you tell the difference?
23051,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Yeah, you used less aura the second time."
23052,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Okay, you pass."
23053,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You'll have an easier time with him \Nif you can tell the difference.
23054,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"When Genthru prepares Little Flower, \Nhe will shroud his hand with {\i0"
23055,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If he's just faking and planning \Nto attack you somewhere else, he probably won't use{\i0"
23056,Victor x And x Loser.,74,If you can tell if his hand is covered \Nwith{\i0 it'll be simpler for you to know \Nwhich attack you should block.
23057,Victor x And x Loser.,74,So that's it.
23058,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gyo{\i0
23059,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Cunning.
23060,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Let me repeat myself.
23061,Victor x And x Loser.,74,The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.
23062,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If you're caught by Little Flower when \Nyou aren't using enough aura to defend, a hit to the face will blow off your eyes, \Nnose, and mouth with no hope of repair."
23063,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin, \Nseverely damaging any nerves or muscle."
23064,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You'll have no fingers or toes left.
23065,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gyo{\i0
23066,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Now what?
23067,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm not interested in continuing this.
23068,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Fighting you has made me see something...
23069,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You have talent and a promising future.
23070,Victor x And x Loser.,74,And many other chances.
23071,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Don't you think it's meaningless to throw \Nall that away just for your pride?
23072,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Just give up, stupid kid!"
23073,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If he makes like he's going to use \Nboth hands to blow you up, that's a red light."
23074,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.
23075,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Sorry, Bisky and Killua."
23076,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm gonna be selfish here.
23077,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I have to give it a try...
23078,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Because I just had a great idea!
23079,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If you seriously mean that, you should surrender, Genthru!"
23080,Victor x And x Loser.,74,A shame...
23081,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Let me show you that there are some things worse than death.
23082,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'll blow up both your arms.
23083,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gyo{\i0
23084,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"After that, I'll blow up your \Nremaining arm and left leg."
23085,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gyo{\i0
23086,Victor x And x Loser.,74,And so on...
23087,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Until you're out of limbs.
23088,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Go ahead and try!
23089,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Very well.
23090,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Take this!
23091,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Wh-What happened?
23092,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Blood?
23093,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Damage?
23094,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He landed a hit?
23095,Victor x And x Loser.,74,First comes rock!
23096,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Crap...
23097,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Move... Dodge!
23098,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock...
23099,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Paper...
23100,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock!
23101,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Did he hit me?
23102,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"No, I tripped."
23103,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What was that?
23104,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What just happened?
23105,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Now I understand...
23106,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Th-This kid...
23107,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He sacrificed both hands!
23108,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!
23109,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"He probably gave up completely on his left hand, protected his right hand with 30% of his aura, and focused the remaining 70% on his legs... to attack me!"
23110,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I use aura both to explode targets and \Nto shield my hand from the blast.
23111,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If I use it on both hands,"
23112,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I won't have much left for the rest of myself.
23113,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He took advantage of that!
23114,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Still, no one sane would actually try that!"
23115,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I gave him a pretty good scare!
23116,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Damn...
23117,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This hurts like hell.
23118,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But...
23119,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm going for it!
23120,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm done...
23121,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He's done?
23122,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Is he giving up?
23123,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Of course...
23124,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That makes sense.
23125,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"He's lost his left hand, \Nand his right is badly injured."
23126,Victor x And x Loser.,74,And he managed to land a hit on me.
23127,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He must be satisfied now.
23128,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm done being selfish...
23129,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Time to get serious!
23130,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Let's do this, Genthru!"
23131,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Th-This kid's totally insane!
23132,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Book!
23133,Victor x And x Loser.,74,A card?
23134,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He shouldn't have anything to concern me.
23135,Victor x And x Loser.,74,The card transformed?
23136,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Paladin's Necklace?!
23137,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What is he planning?
23138,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This is your last chance to surrender.
23139,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Once I use this, you could end up dead."
23140,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You're clearly bluffing!
23141,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Now wait...
23142,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This is my chance.
23143,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Book.
23144,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I give up.
23145,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Obviously, you're never going to surrender."
23146,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Take them.
23147,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'll silence him.
23148,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Crushing his windpipe and \Nknocking him out would be best.
23149,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Then I can take the cards from his binder.
23150,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I have one request.
23151,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What is it?
23152,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Could you leave me this card?
23153,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Bah...
23154,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gyo{\i1
23155,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But I did manage to crush his windpipe!
23156,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.
23157,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Genthru...
23158,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You have made the worst mistake you could make.
23159,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gasoline \N\NA glass container \Nfilled with fuel. \NHighly flammable.
23160,Victor x And x Loser.,74,One minute!
23161,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What's that smell?
23162,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He can't use Little Flower any longer.
23163,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm going to take him down!
23164,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Book.
23165,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Oh, so this is gasoline..."
23166,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Very clever.
23167,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"True, I cannot use Little Flower now..."
23168,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"However, I have another ability,"
23169,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Countdown.
23170,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"The ability that lets me set a bomb when I touch someone and say ""Bomber."""
23171,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"The bomb can only be disarmed \Nby touching me and saying,"
23172,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"""I caught the Bomber."""
23173,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.
23174,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Nen{\i0
23175,Victor x And x Loser.,74,All the activation requirements have been met.
23176,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If I touch you and say, ""Bomber,"" \Nthe countdown will begin."
23177,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Try to run away...
23178,Victor x And x Loser.,74,If you still have the strength.
23179,Victor x And x Loser.,74,The requirements have been met... for me!
23180,Victor x And x Loser.,74,First comes rock...
23181,Victor x And x Loser.,74,This is his earlier attack...
23182,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If get too close, I'm done for."
23183,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Is he trying to keep me back?
23184,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock...
23185,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Paper...
23186,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock!
23187,Victor x And x Loser.,74,A pitfall?
23188,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But he's falling with me!
23189,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It's deep...
23190,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I can't climb back up.
23191,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But he should be in the same boat.
23192,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He's ended up cornering himself.
23193,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He's gone.
23194,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Genthru...
23195,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If a card is removed from \Nthe binder for a minute, it reverts to an item."
23196,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Large Rock
23197,Victor x And x Loser.,74,A rock?!
23198,Victor x And x Loser.,74,First comes rock...
23199,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock...
23200,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Paper...
23201,Victor x And x Loser.,74,W-W-Wait!
23202,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I surrender! I surrender!
23203,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Rock!
23204,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Osu!
23205,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Are you awake?
23206,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Summon your binder.
23207,Victor x And x Loser.,74,We want you to return the cards you stole from the people you backstabbed.
23208,Victor x And x Loser.,74,On one condition...
23209,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Use Archangel to heal Bara.
23210,Victor x And x Loser.,74,We have a Clone card.
23211,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Don't worry.
23212,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That was always part of the plan.
23213,Victor x And x Loser.,74,We brought six copies of Clone.
23214,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Book...
23215,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gain!
23216,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What is your wish?
23217,Victor x And x Loser.,74,We need you to heal his hands and throat.
23218,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?"
23219,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Easily done.
23220,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Then I shall heal his body.
23221,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm healed!
23222,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Then, farewell."
23223,Victor x And x Loser.,74,All right!
23224,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Okay, here's the extra Archangel."
23225,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Gain!
23226,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Next up is Killua.
23227,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Genthru, we're going to use your binder."
23228,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Go ahead.
23229,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Clone on!
23230,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Breath of Archangel has reached \Nits maximum card limit.
23231,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Clone will be destroyed.
23232,Victor x And x Loser.,74,W-W-Wait!
23233,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What's going on?!
23234,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Did I do something wrong?
23235,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"No, it's Goreinu."
23236,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Huh?
23237,Victor x And x Loser.,74,He used Clone or Transform to increase the \Nnumber of Breath of Archangel vouchers.
23238,Victor x And x Loser.,74,So two of his vouchers became \NBreath of Archangel cards.
23239,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Another player has used Contact to reach you.
23240,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Yo, it's Goreinu."
23241,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Looks like you won.
23242,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But I don't approve of this.
23243,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If you plan to use Breath of Archangel \Nto heal these murderers, the trade is off!"
23244,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You okay with using it on me?
23245,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Of course.
23246,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I am an assassin.
23247,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Eh?
23248,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I've killed more people than these guys.
23249,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Each player in this game risks their \Nlife in one way or another.
23250,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That doesn't make it okay to kill others.
23251,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But all the people I've killed were \Nnot nearly as prepared to die.
23252,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm worse than these guys.
23253,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"No, you aren't like them."
23254,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"I like you, but I hate their guts!"
23255,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That isn't a valid reason!
23256,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I don't need a reason...
23257,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What counts is how I feel.
23258,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Aren't you guys the same way?
23259,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But we don't think it's right to let them die because we hate them.
23260,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"In battle, both sides risk their lives, and are prepared to kill."
23261,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.
23262,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I haven't forgiven Genthru for \Nkilling all those players...
23263,Victor x And x Loser.,74,But the three of us agreed before the fight that we'd bring six Clone cards.
23264,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"I don't really remember why we decided that, but it wasn't based on logic or reason."
23265,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It was just the decision that came naturally to us.
23266,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Once the fight was over and we'd \Nobtained Breath of Archangel, we planned to heal everyone."
23267,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"All three of us made the decision, \Nso we wanted to stick to it."
23268,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"But I understand how you feel, \Nand we can't change your mind."
23269,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Sorry, Killua..."
23270,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Could you wait a little longer?
23271,Victor x And x Loser.,74,No problem.
23272,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'll recover on my own in a while.
23273,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"The situation's changed, so we \Ncan't use Clone anymore."
23274,Victor x And x Loser.,74,There's only one Breath of Archangel left.
23275,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Only one? Isn't that the original?
23276,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Use it on Genthru.
23277,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I'm fine...
23278,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora."
23279,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Yeah.
23280,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Hey, wait up..."
23281,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel."
23282,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Huh?
23283,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Really? Are you sure?
23284,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Yeah, actually..."
23285,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Before you told me all this, \NI planned to give it to you."
23286,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Not just Archangel, but all of our cards."
23287,Victor x And x Loser.,74,What?!
23288,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed."
23289,Victor x And x Loser.,74,We've decided to give up on the game.
23290,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Wow, I'm completely healed!"
23291,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Oh, so Mr. Battera..."
23292,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his \Nteam for breaking his promise."
23293,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I got four billion out of it.
23294,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Four billion?!
23295,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Hey...
23296,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Share some of the wealth!
23297,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Wh-What are you talking about?
23298,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Each of the four of us gets one billion!
23299,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Eh?!
23300,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It's only fair...
23301,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I couldn't have done this on my own.
23302,Victor x And x Loser.,74,It was only possible because \NI teamed up with you guys.
23303,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I can't believe it...
23304,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You're such a nice guy!
23305,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Anyway, you can take all the cards."
23306,Victor x And x Loser.,74,On one condition!
23307,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You must be the first players to beat the game.
23308,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Yep!
23309,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Not a problem.
23310,Victor x And x Loser.,74,That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.
23311,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Leaving only #0.
23312,Victor x And x Loser.,74,One card to go...
23313,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Yeah.
23314,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Ninety-seven, ninety-eight..."
23315,Victor x And x Loser.,74,And this is...

23324,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Please wait with your binders open.
23325,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?"
23326,Victor x And x Loser.,74,I get it.
23327,Victor x And x Loser.,74,The questions are probably \Ndesigned so that players who mainly stole cards can't answer them.
23328,Victor x And x Loser.,74,Someone's coming!
23329,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"Wait, more over here!"
23330,Victor x And x Loser.,74,The long battle has finally \Nreached its final stage.

23344,Victor x And x Loser.,74,You'll be fine.
23345,Victor x And x Loser.,74,"If your eyes meet, you're friends."
23346,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Don't worry.
23347,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,We aren't here to get in your way.
23348,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"In fact, you could say we're here to help."
23349,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Help?
23350,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah.
23351,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"If we get the top score on \Nthe quiz and win the card, we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion."
23352,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,That's only five percent of your reward.
23353,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"It's a reasonable price, yeah?"
23354,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Oh, right..."
23355,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,They haven't heard about Battera yet.
23356,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Sure, if you get the top score."
23357,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Everyone else is here for the chance \Nto sell us the final card, too?"
23358,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"With the game ending, they're all hoping to share in the reward."
23359,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,It looks like they're going \Nto take the quiz in teams.
23360,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What should we do?
23361,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What? We should do it by ourselves.
23362,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah.
23363,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Whoever scores lower gets penalized.
23364,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Okay, I'm in!"
23365,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Honestly... They've got guts.
23366,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"They just came from a fight to the death, and now they're facing the final event \Nin the game with such confidence."
23367,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I bet those two enjoyed this \Ngame more than anyone.

23395,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,The quiz is over.

23397,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"With a score of 87 out of 100 points, our top scoring player is Gon."

23406,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,How many points did I get?
23407,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Ruler's Invitation?
23408,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Ruler's Invitation \N\NAn invitation from \Nthis island's ruler. \NThe envelope contains \Na map that shows the \Ncastle and a badge. \NPlayer must have badge \Nto enter the castle.
23409,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Looks like only the one with \Nthe badge is invited.
23410,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,So Limeiro is the capital?
23411,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I have to go alone?
23412,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,We'll wait for you by the castle.
23413,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Hey, he really got it."
23414,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,That kid really collected all the cards.
23415,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Hey, let's have a contest with \Nall your cards at stake."
23416,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Sorry, but you don't have a choice."
23417,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Then I'll take an Accompany card.
23418,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Wait, that won't work."
23419,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,We haven't been to Limeiro before.
23420,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,So we should use Drift...
23421,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Since we've been to the other cities before.
23422,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Drift \N\NTransports you to a \Npreviously unvisited city. \N(If all cities have been \Nvisited, Drift is used, \Nwithout transporting player.)\N[SR][NORM]"
23423,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro, then come back for you guys."
23424,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Accompany will work after that.
23425,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Drift on!
23426,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Bingo!
23427,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Accompany \N\NWarp all players within 20 meters \Nof caster to city (must have been visited) \Nor player of your choice (must have \Nbeen met inside the game). \N\N[SR][NORM]
23428,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Let's go, Gon."
23429,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yep.
23430,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Accompany on!
23431,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Limeiro!
23432,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Those kids are amazing.
23433,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.
23434,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Of course...
23435,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,They even defeated the bombers.
23436,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"It's true, those boys are much stronger \Nthan when I first met them."
23437,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,But they're still weaker than \NGenthru in raw power.
23438,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,They must have executed a brilliant plan...
23439,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Well, no matter."
23440,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.
23441,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Magnetic Force on.
23442,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Chrollo Lucilfer.
23443,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Nen{\i0
23444,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I wonder what he's feeling.
23445,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What he's feeling?
23446,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"He might meet Ging, after all."
23447,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,The father he's been searching for all this time.
23448,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Welcome to Greed Island Castle.
23449,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Come in.
23450,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This place is a dump!
23451,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun."
23452,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!"
23453,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I hear you're Ging's son?
23454,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Why don't you have a seat?
23455,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Uh...
23456,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Where should I sit?
23457,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Isn't there any open space?
23458,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Clear some space, then..."
23459,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Like this!
23460,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Uh...
23461,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Wait, where did I put it?"
23462,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Oh! Here it is!
23463,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,There you go.
23464,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Ruler's Blessing \N\NCastle awarded to the \Nwinner of the quiz. \NComes with capital city \N(population 10,000). \NThe city's residents \Nwill obey any laws or \Ncommands you give."
23465,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Ruler's Blessing, the reward for the top scorer."
23466,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,How about it?!
23467,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Isn't it cool?
23468,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Are you amazed? Well?
23469,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"There are 10,000 people in this city."
23470,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,One of them could be...
23471,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Wait, did I get your hopes up?"
23472,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Well?
23473,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Or were you just thinking that \NGing could be the ruler?
23474,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I was not!
23475,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I never considered that Ging might be here.
23476,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Oh, really now?"
23477,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"That's good, then..."
23478,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Since he's not.
23479,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Dwun-san, can we get to business?"
23480,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Oh, my bad."
23481,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Listen up.
23482,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You've collected all one hundred cards.
23483,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Which triggers a new event.
23484,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Hmm...
23485,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Oh, here it is!"
23486,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This is it.
23487,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Open it up.
23488,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You can place three restricted \Nslot cards in this binder.
23489,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You can then take those three back \Nfor use in the real world.
23490,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,However!
23491,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You cannot take multiple \Ncopies of the same card.
23492,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You must choose three different restricted \Nslot cards from the hundred in your binder.
23493,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Okay, you've reached the ending..."
23494,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Do you want the normal ending, \Nor the ending just for you?"
23495,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Just for me?
23496,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yep, that's right."
23497,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Which one do you want? Well?
23498,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Then I'll take the normal one.
23499,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Why would you choose that one?
23500,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's the normal ending, my friends \Ncan watch with me, right?"
23501,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I see...
23502,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Dwun-san?
23503,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Huh?
23504,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Would you stop teasing him?
23505,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I'm sorry...
23506,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,There's no such thing as an ending just for you.
23507,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What? Really?
23508,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"However, there's a message we've been told \Nto give you only after you beat the game."
23509,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.
23510,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I'm List.
23511,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,He's Dwun.
23512,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"As you probably know, \Nwe're friends of your old man."
23513,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This game was created by Ging \Nand ten of his friends.
23514,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"The name ""Greed Island"" was created from the first letter in each of their names."
23515,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Your father was in charge, so we wanted a word that began \Nwith ""G,"" and settled on ""Greed."""
23516,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Have you met Razor?
23517,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"He's the ""R,"" and I'm the ""L."""
23518,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,The girl who explains the game at the start is the twin of the girl you see \Nwhen leaving the island.
23519,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Eeta and Elena.
23520,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Both names begin with ""E."""
23521,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"And then, we have ""D""!"
23522,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Wanna hear my story? Well?
23523,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
23524,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Y-Yeah...
23525,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Okay, pay attention."
23526,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"You see, that Ging... was a totally mean guy!"
23527,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Totally mean!
23528,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,My name is Dwun!
23529,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What do you think is the first letter?
23530,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Huh? Isn't it ""D""?"
23531,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Even you, huh?"
23532,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Of course you'd think so...
23533,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"After all, you're Ging's son."
23534,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Weren't we talking about ""D""?"
23535,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"It's ""W!"" ""W!"""
23536,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,W-d-w-u-n-e.
23537,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Wdwune!
23538,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,That was my name!
23539,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"But even my oldest friends \Nthought it began with ""D."""
23540,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"So when we decided on the \Ngame's name, I was clear..."
23541,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"That my name began with ""W."""
23542,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What do you think Ging said?
23543,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Really?
23544,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Then, ditch the ""W."""
23545,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n..."
23546,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Dwun.
23547,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Can you believe him?
23548,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,He changed my name without asking.
23549,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Just so the title of the game would work!
23550,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What's really amazing is that Ging had legally changed \Nthe name a minute later.
23551,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,He only needed a phone and a computer.
23552,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"What's worse is that he even removed \Nthe ""E"" because he got confused!"
23553,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,But your luck has been better as a result.
23554,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I guess! Ever since...
23555,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Once I've chosen the three cards, \NI'm supposed to go to the port."
23556,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Did they tell you about your father?
23557,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yeah, but they don't know \Nwhere he is right now."
23558,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Oh...
23559,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,So I guess the game didn't have any clues.
23560,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Well, that's what the starting message said."
23561,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yeah, that's true."
23562,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"So, what will you do for the three cards?"
23563,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,How about we each pick one?
23564,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Blue Planet \N\NA gemstone with an \Nincomparable blue shine. \NIts composition matches \Nno known minerals, \Nso it's named for its \Notherworldly nature."
23565,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Then I want Blue Planet!
23566,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This is still the best one!
23567,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I can't wait to see the real thing...
23568,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Which one do you want, Killua?"
23569,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I'm still thinking.
23570,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Have you decided, Gon?"
23571,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yeah, I think so."
23572,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Really? Which one?
23573,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Let's see...
23574,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This one.
23575,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Which one?
23576,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Wait, why this one?"
23577,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I get it.
23578,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,That makes sense.
23579,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You're only allowed to take \Nrestricted slot cards...
23580,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yep, that sounds fun!"
23581,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,When did you have the idea?
23582,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,The moment I saw this card.
23583,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Paladin's Necklace \N\NWhen a player wears this, \Nall spells targeting player \Nwill be reflected. \NCan also dispel curses \Nplaced on any card \Ntouched by player."
23584,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,But this one won't be enough.
23585,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Right, we also need this one."
23586,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Transform \N\NChange one card in your possession into any \Nother card in your possession. (Card will now \Ncount against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen, \Nand the Transform card will be destroyed.) \N\N[SR][NORM]"
23587,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Eh?
23588,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Do you think this will work?
23589,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah.
23590,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,And this is the only way to do it!
23591,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Wait, what is this?"
23592,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What are you talking about?
23593,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?"
23594,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Let me in on this!
23595,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Congratulations on clearing the game.
23596,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Please choose three restricted \Nslot cards from your binder.
23597,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,"
23598,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Patch of Shore \N\NThe entrance to an \Nunderwater cavern known \Nas the Sea God's Grotto. \NThe cavern changes \Nevery time you enter.
23599,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Blue Planet \N\NA gemstone with an \Nincomparable blue shine. \NIts composition matches \Nno known minerals, \Nso it's named for its \Notherworldly nature."
23600,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"#81, Blue Planet,"
23601,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Paladin's Necklace \N\NWhen a player wears this, \Nall spells targeting player \Nwill be reflected. \NCan also dispel curses \Nplaced on any card \Ntouched by player. and #84, Paladin's Necklace."
23602,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Are you sure these are the three cards you want?
23603,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yep.
23604,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Then I will now return your ring.
23605,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Good work.
23606,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Thank you...
23607,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Uh, Elena-san!"
23608,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,You remembered my name?
23609,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Thank you.
23610,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Goodbye.
23611,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Welcome back!
23612,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah.
23613,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,We're back in the real world now?
23614,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I can't tell.
23615,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Well, the game was part of the real world."
23616,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Hey, hurry up!"
23617,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Bring out your binder...
23618,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Book.
23619,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Gain!
23620,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This is it!
23621,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,This is what I wanted!
23622,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!
23623,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I'm so happy!
23624,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,What should I name it?
23625,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Pla-chan?
23626,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Maybe Blue-chan?
23627,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Planet-chan?
23628,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!"
23629,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"So, are you sure about the two you picked?"
23630,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Yeah, these are the best ones, right?"
23631,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yep.
23632,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Then let's give it a go!
23633,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah!
23634,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Gain!
23635,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Give it to me, Killua."
23636,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yes! It worked!
23637,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Okay!
23638,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I see.
23639,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"You used Transform to make \NAccompany a restricted slot card, then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it."
23640,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,That's clever thinking...
23641,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"But I'm surprised you'd do \Nall that for an Accompany, rather than choose a restricted slot card."
23642,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah...
23643,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Well, if I hadn't been the first \None of us to enter the game,"
23644,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I probably wouldn't have noticed.
23645,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Remember when we played \Nrock-paper-scissors here?
23646,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Rock-paper-scissors?
23647,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Yeah.
23648,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I was the first to enter the game.
23649,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"And while I was waiting for Killua, \Nno one else was around."
23650,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Which means the first person I met in the game should have been the second \None to go in, Goreinu-san."
23651,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"But when I checked my binder, there was someone I met before him."
23652,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,Nigg \N\NGoreinu

23655,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"My guess is that when I was a \Nbaby, I came here with Ging."
23656,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,He was probably trying to tell me this:
23657,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,"
23658,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,I have to get strong enough \Nto clear the game...

23669,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,It doesn't take much to make me cry...
23670,Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.,75,"Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?"

23723,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"You should be grateful, you idiot!"
23724,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,An ant?
23725,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Are you hurt?
23726,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Is that Ging?
23727,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That isn't Ging...
23728,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Hey...
23729,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,What was that about?
23730,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"First you push us down, then you fire at us!"
23731,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Enough fooling around!
23732,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Fooling around?
23733,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I was being dead serious.
23734,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"If I hadn't opened fire, \Nyou would have been attacked."
23735,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,By what?!
23736,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,The ant you shot?
23737,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ow!
23738,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,What is this?
23739,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Idiot!
23740,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That's no ordinary ant.
23741,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It's a Chimera Ant.
23742,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,A Chimera Ant?
23743,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"An aggressive, carnivorous insect, \Ncurrently under class-1 quarantine."
23744,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"From time to time, they even attack humans."
23745,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,You were standing right in front of their nest.
23746,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Had I not fired, a Chimera Ant army would \Nhave consumed you by now."
23747,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I feel like this has happened before...
23748,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Don't worry, it's not serious."
23749,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Apply this.
23750,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It's an antibiotic.
23751,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,What? That's it?
23752,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Let's go nuts, man!"
23753,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Shut up... Go away.
23754,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"You should leave, as well."
23755,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Damn...
23756,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Because of this interruption, \NI'll need to start over."
23757,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,But the nest was destroyed.
23758,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Man, forced to take another life..."
23759,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ah!
23760,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Man, forced to take another life..."
23761,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Are you...
23762,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Are you the one who saved me back then?
23763,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Back then?
23764,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"On Whale Island, after I stumbled into \Nthe territory of a Foxbear with its cub."
23765,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Whale Island?
23766,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"That time, too, you had to kill, in order to protect me."
23767,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Oh, yes. I remember now."
23768,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I never expected to run into you again here.
23769,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"You've grown, Gon."
23770,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,How do you know my name?
23771,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"I heard it from your dad,"
23772,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging-san.
23773,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Old man, you know Ging?"
23774,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Old...
23775,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yeah, my name is Kite."
23776,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging-san was my master.
23777,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?"
23778,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?"
23779,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Call me Kite.
23780,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It's awkward being addressed \Nformally by my master's son.
23781,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Okay.
23782,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Then, you're one too, Kite?"
23783,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yeah, Ging-san was the one who \Nmade me a top-class Hunter."
23784,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He was my teacher and benefactor.
23785,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"If I hadn't met Ging-san,"
23786,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum."
23787,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Wait up!
23788,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Damned brat!
23789,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He swiped the bread that \NI'd managed to find...
23790,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He isn't escaping today.
23791,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,My bread!
23792,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Bastard, you won't get away today!"
23793,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ow!
23794,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,What is this?
23795,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,What are you doing?
23796,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Stop it...
23797,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,You live with these guys?
23798,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That sounds fun.
23799,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That was how you met Ging?
23800,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Yeah...
23801,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging-san said that good Hunters \Nare well-liked by animals.
23802,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"He said I had potential, so I got interested."
23803,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,And you became his student?
23804,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I had to force him to teach me.
23805,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...
23806,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,So I was never his student officially.
23807,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,But I was a stubborn one...
23808,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I kept bugging him.
23809,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Nen{\i0 and he began teaching me to hunt.
23810,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"As a result, I was able to pass the \NHunter Exam with little difficulty."
23811,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"But before Ging-san was satisfied, \NI had to clear another hurdle."
23812,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Can you guess what it was?
23813,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I think I might know.
23814,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Oh?
23815,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"No, I definitely know."
23816,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,This is what Ging would have said...
23817,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"""Try to catch me."""
23818,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Exactly. You're right.
23819,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I knew it! I figured that was it!
23820,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"But as far as I knew, he was \Nthe world's greatest Hunter."
23821,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.
23822,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,There were no clues or leads to begin from.
23823,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.
23824,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He'd managed to completely erase \Nhis existence from this world.
23825,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Like a super-powered form of{\i0
23826,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,So...
23827,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,So what happened in the end?
23828,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue, so I went to his home."
23829,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,To Whale Island.
23830,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"That was when I met you, Gon."
23831,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"But back then, I didn't realize that you were Ging-san's son."
23832,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san and told him about what had \Nhappened on Whale Island.
23833,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That was my kid... His name is Gon.
23834,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Thanks for hitting him.
23835,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It's common sense to avoid
23836,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Foxbear territory when they're raising young.
23837,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Ging-san wasn't surprised that I went to Whale Island, \Nor that I met you there."
23838,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It was almost as though he'd expected it.
23839,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Looking back, it may be that everything's gone \Naccording to Ging-san's plans."
23840,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Are you saying he set all this up?
23841,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Well, I can't prove it."
23842,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,You might be right.
23843,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Razor was waiting for me.
23844,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,And Dwun and List.
23845,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Razor? Dwun?
23846,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed Island{\i0
23847,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,It's a long story.
23848,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"In the game, a guy named Razor was \Nwaiting for me, at Ging's request."
23849,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,My son will come here one day.
23850,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"When that happens, give him a good beating."
23851,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
23852,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Don't get too cocky.
23853,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He is my son.
23854,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Then, I'm counting on you, Razor."
23855,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends
23856,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed Island{\i0
23857,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Oh, Razor was also one of them..."
23858,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Anyway, those three were waiting for me."
23859,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"When I learned that, I realized something."
23860,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed \NIsland{\i0 meeting Bisky and the others may have \Nbeen another part of his plan.
23861,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"In that case, it's possible that Ging also planned \Nthat you'd meet Kite here."
23862,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Huh?
23863,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Oh, that's right!"
23864,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed Island{\i0
23865,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Me?
23866,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yeah, did you register under the name ""Nigg""?"
23867,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Nigg?
23868,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"No, I don't recall that name."
23869,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Wait...
23870,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I do remember Ging-san taking \Nme inside a game...
23871,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I knew it!
23872,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed Island{\i0
23873,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yes, I believe that was its title."
23874,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,But I can't remember if I used an alias.
23875,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That must be it...
23876,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.
23877,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Damn! He tricked me!
23878,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?"
23879,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Are you sure this was the right decision,"
23880,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging?
23881,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Can you make it so that using \NMagnetic Force will send Gon to me, while using Accompany will send him to Kite?"
23882,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I can...
23883,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Why do you want me to do that?
23884,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on \Nhis own, I'm willing to meet with him."
23885,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,But I can't meet him if he's so gutless \Nthat he has to bring friends.
23886,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?
23887,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I don't understand.
23888,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Never mind... Just do it!
23889,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,You'd probably just be \Nembarrassed if he brought a crowd.
23890,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Shut up! Just do it!
23891,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,He's so weird...
23892,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Shy and stubborn.
23893,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I feel sorry for Gon-kun.
23894,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I understand.
23895,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Greed Island{\i0
23896,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Only Gon, really."
23897,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I just tagged along for the ride.
23898,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"That may have been part of Ging's plan, too."
23899,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Even me?
23900,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Nah, that's impossible."
23901,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"However, it appears that our meeting \Nhere wasn't coincidence."
23902,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yeah, I agree."
23903,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,There must be a deeper meaning to this.
23904,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Meaning?
23905,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Razor waited inside the \Ngame to make you stronger, so one would think Ging must \Nhave some role for Kite to play."
23906,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,A role...
23907,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Your final test was finding Ging, right?"
23908,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Yeah.
23909,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,That sounds like a daunting task.
23910,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"The best Hunters in this world are masters of not only hunting, \Nbut concealing themselves as well."
23911,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Yet you were able to find him.
23912,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Oh...
23913,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Yeah, that's true."
23914,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Once you cleared your final test,"
23915,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging must have decided you were \Nworthy of handling this.
23916,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Handling this? Handling what?
23917,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Handling what? Basically...
23918,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Thanks for hitting him.
23919,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Say, Gon..."
23920,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Want me to tell you Ging-san's \Ncurrent whereabouts?
23921,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"No, I'll find him on my own."
23922,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,A good response.
23923,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Anyway, tell me about Ging."
23924,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Tell me everything you know!
23925,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,How to help two-headed wolves breed?
23926,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging is involved in that stuff?
23927,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Sure, Ging-san is involved with a \Nwide range of Hunter activities."
23928,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"He's never formally applied \Nbecause he doesn't want to expend the energy, but he's as \Nqualified as a Triple Star Hunter."
23929,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Triple Star?
23930,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Stars are awarded to Hunters who \Nperform extraordinary tasks.
23931,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Those responsible for historical discoveries or global \Nachievements receive three stars.
23932,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,There are fewer than ten of \Nthese Hunters in the world.
23933,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"The title ""Triple Star Hunter"" \Nis reserved for the very best."
23934,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,So Ging is as good as the best!
23935,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Kite...
23936,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.
23937,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Ging-san is also famous for discovering the Lurka Ruins \Nand the Kongo gold vein.
23938,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!"
23939,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Kite, student of Ging..."
23940,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,While his meeting with Gon and Killua signaled the \Nbeginning of a new adventure...
23941,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"On the Yorbian continent, in the \Nsouthernmost of the Balsa Islands, a prologue to unparalleled fear was quietly but steadily unfolding."
23942,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Not enough.
23943,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"These creatures are not enough, \Nno matter how many I eat."
23944,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,But I cannot move...
23945,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Stay calm.
23946,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Focus on recovering my energy.
23947,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I must heal before I can take the next step.
23948,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I have a duty to fulfill...
23949,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I must give birth to the King!
23950,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,I am the Queen!
23951,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,Next time: Unease x And x Sighting.
23952,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,"Are you uneasy, Killua?"
23953,Reunion x And x Understanding.,76,D-Don't embarrass me!
23954,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I have a duty to fulfill...
23955,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I must give birth to the King!
23956,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I am the Queen!
23957,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Unease x And x Sighting
23958,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"After using Accompany,"
23959,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Gon and Killua were transported \Nto Ging's student, Kite."
23960,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"After Gon remembered having \Nmet Kite years before, he felt that Ging intended \Nfor this meeting to occur, and his interest in Kite grew."
23961,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?"
23962,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Biological surveying.
23963,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I focus on discovering and \Nresearching new species.
23964,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?"
23965,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Camp Tiger?
23966,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They can use fire.
23967,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They use branches that have been \Nignited by lightning as live kindle.
23968,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Other than certain Magical \NBeasts that walk on two legs, they're the first of their kind: animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw."
23969,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Wow, they're really cooking it."
23970,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They really are using fire!
23971,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Hey, what else is there?"
23972,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, yeah..."
23973,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You said the thing that attacked \Nme was a Chimera Ant?
23974,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, a Chimera Ant."
23975,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Under a class-1 quarantine.
23976,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Normally, no one would be allowed \Nnear such a dangerous insect."
23977,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Did you discover them?
23978,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"No, I specialize in larger creatures."
23979,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"But currently, I'm investigating these insects."
23980,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Something has been bothering me...
23981,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"But it appears that now, I'll have \Nto move to a different location."
23982,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I must make a call, but I'm not \Ngetting any reception here."
23983,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,A call?
23984,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm working with others.
23985,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Seven of us are working as a team.
23986,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I guess I must wait for their arrival.
23987,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Once they're here, I'll introduce you."
23988,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters."
23989,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Oh?
23990,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Ah, speak of the devil."
23991,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Kite, who are these kids?"
23992,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My friends.
23993,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They dropped by for a visit on their travels.
23994,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, it's a pleasure to meet \Nyou all the way out here."
23995,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm Spinner Clow.
23996,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Call me Spin!
23997,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Nice to meet you.
23998,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm Gon Freecss.
23999,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Nice to meet you, Spin."
24000,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Freecss...
24001,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Wait, is this..."
24002,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, Ging-san's son."
24003,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Really?!
24004,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"And you? Not you, too?"
24005,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"No, not me."
24006,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My name is Killua Zoldyck.
24007,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Zoldyck...
24008,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you \Npart of the famous family of assassins?"
24009,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yeah, but I quit."
24010,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Additionally, they are both pro Hunters."
24011,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,So you should show some respect.
24012,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Wow!
24013,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Man, that was a shock!"
24014,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"We've been conducting biological \Nsurveys with Kite for three years, but this is the most incredible \Norganism we've ever seen!"
24015,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yeah, no kidding..."
24016,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I don't think we finished our introductions.
24017,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm Monta Yuras.
24018,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,But call me Mon.
24019,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Nice to meet you, Mon."
24020,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm Stick Dinner.
24021,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I handle the cooking.
24022,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Know why?
24023,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Because my name is Dinner.
24024,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Nice meeting you.
24025,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My name is Banana Kavaro.
24026,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Good to meet you.
24027,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We have two others on our team.
24028,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Where are Podungo and Lin?
24029,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They're both headed toward \Nthe area of the sighting.
24030,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They always move so fast.
24031,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, and you were right, Kite..."
24032,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,This looks just like the claw \Nof a Chimera Ant queen.
24033,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"We ran some computer analyses, \Nand the result was a 99% match."
24034,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Can I see it?
24035,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Sure.
24036,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,This is a Chimera Ant claw?
24037,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's as big as a human finger.
24038,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Does that mean there are huge ants?
24039,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We don't know.
24040,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Maybe one mutated and grew really big?
24041,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"That's possible, though it may also belong \Nto a completely different species."
24042,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Regardless, we just don't know right now."
24043,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That's why we're investigating.
24044,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It all started with the wonkiest little thing...
24045,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,His name was Won!
24046,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,He was a Kakin official.
24047,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,What's Kakin?
24048,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Right here.
24049,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"It's this wild land, in the middle \Nof the Azian continent."
24050,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We had just completed a biological \Nsurvey they had requested when...
24051,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Magnificent.
24052,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You've completed two hundred years' \Nworth of work for this agency...
24053,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"To be honest, I regret that I am \Nunable to pay you a bonus."
24054,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Don't say that, Won-san."
24055,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We enjoyed ourselves.
24056,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"In lieu of that,"
24057,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'll be sure to recommend you \Nto other friendly nations.
24058,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We appreciate it.
24059,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, that's right!"
24060,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'm going to ramble a bit.
24061,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I believe part of a very strange species was \Nbrought to the Southern Piece auction...
24062,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"There's suspicion that it's from \Nan unidentified organism, so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog, but since they'd have to donate it \Nto a government agency otherwise, they hoped a licensed Hunter would \Nbuy it from them for a high price."
24063,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Here you are.
24064,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Well, Lin?"
24065,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Th-This clearly belongs to an \Nunidentified organism, yes."
24066,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"F-From what I can see, \Nit resembles an insect's leg..."
24067,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.
24068,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And the claw exhibits traits \Nnot found among insects...
24069,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"A leg typically has two claws, but this has six."
24070,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It almost looks as though the tarsi \Nevolved into something like fingers?
24071,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, and this part is spiny, \Nso it could be the tibia."
24072,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"If we take a sample and study \Nit further, we'll learn more."
24073,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Could you give us a small part?
24074,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Since Won-san referred you \Nto us, we cannot refuse."
24075,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Let's look into this, then."
24076,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"We'll send you any results, once we have them."
24077,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Appreciated.
24078,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Chimera Ant...
24079,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Where did Lin and Podungo go?
24080,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Somewhere south of Yorknew City.
24081,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,The person who found the insect leg \Napparently lives in a city by the ocean.
24082,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath, \Nbut we should hurry after them."
24083,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Hey, can we come with you?"
24084,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Hmm?
24085,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Sure.
24086,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Yes!
24087,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Glad to have you.
24088,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.
24089,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And this is Ging-san's son and \None of the Zoldyck family!
24090,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, sorry..."
24091,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's no big deal.
24092,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?"
24093,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We weren't born with the talent...
24094,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Talent, talent... Guess I have a \Ntalent for saying ""talent,"" huh?"
24095,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"In this brief period of time, \Nthey've become friends."
24096,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
24097,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And also blessed with good friends.
24098,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Gon might be the real deal...
24099,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"He'll find you soon, Ging-san."
24100,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Not enough... Not enough...
24101,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I need more, bigger food."
24102,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's been days...
24103,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"No, it's been months since it last rained here."
24104,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,The weather is unusual this year.
24105,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's possible that this is affecting \Nthe wildlife in some way.
24106,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,So the insect with the large leg could have been a mutation \Ninfluenced by those conditions.
24107,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,But why would it have grown larger?
24108,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"In order to survive, right?"
24109,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"If it's bigger, it'd have a better \Nchance of securing food."
24110,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"But that would mean it'd need more, as well."
24111,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Being larger doesn't always aid survival.
24112,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I believe that this is related to the Chimera Ant's unique \Nnature, not to the environment."
24113,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I agree.
24114,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Because they reproduce in a way \Nnot found in any other organism.
24115,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,What do you mean?
24116,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They reproduce through a special \Nprocess known as phagogenesis.
24117,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Phagogenesis?
24118,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,What's that?
24119,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Phagogenesis
24120,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms, she is able to pass traits on from those organisms to the next generation."
24121,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And she can also eat multiple species to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.
24122,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs."
24123,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"The first generation of births has \Nno reproductive capability, so they become worker or soldier ants."
24124,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,They work in service to the queen \Nand her eventual successors.
24125,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Those successors are the king and \Nqueen of the next generation.
24126,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"The queen is thus always looking to \Nconsume the genes of strong organisms, so she can pass them to her offspring."
24127,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And she may consume any species she \Nparticularly likes to extinction.
24128,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,To extinction?!
24129,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her to consume her own weight many \Ntimes over, in a single day."
24130,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That's why Chimera Ants are \Nunder a class-1 quarantine.
24131,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?"
24132,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Judging from the size of that claw, \Nher length is at least two meters."
24133,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That thing could devour a human in no time.
24134,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, you are correct."
24135,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Stay back! Go away!
24136,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,B-Big Brother...
24137,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Reina, stay close to me."
24138,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Take that!
24139,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's okay now.
24140,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Thank you!
24141,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You can count on your big brother.
24142,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'll always keep you safe!
24143,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Yeah!
24144,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Okay, let's go home."
24145,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Hey, my brother was amazing!"
24146,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"There was a big snake, but he was like,"
24147,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"""Stay back! Go away!"""
24148,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Whack!
24149,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Come now, don't wave your spoon around."
24150,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's bad manners.
24151,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,But that's what he did.
24152,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yes, yes. I know."
24153,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That was very brave.
24154,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"If a big snake showed up, \Nyour mother might be too scared to move."
24155,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"You're truly a young man, Kurt."
24156,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yeah, I guess."
24157,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You're already nine...
24158,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And a reliable big brother.
24159,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You must continue to look after Reina.
24160,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I'm counting on you, Kurt."
24161,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I'm counting on you, Brother."
24162,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Yeah, you can count on me!"
24163,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'll keep you both safe forever!
24164,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,This area is about to hatch.
24165,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Soldiers, hear me!"
24166,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My duty is to give birth to the King.
24167,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"In order to give birth to a strong king,"
24168,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.
24169,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Search out the best food you can find!
24170,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,This area will also hatch soon.
24171,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I require a large nest in \Nwhich to birth a strong king.
24172,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I also need time to rest, free from concerns \Nof outside disturbances, during the pregnancy."
24173,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"In order to give birth to a strong \Nking, I need strong soldiers."
24174,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Are you okay?
24175,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Uh-huh, thank you..."
24176,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Hey, Brother..."
24177,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you."
24178,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Sure.
24179,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Let's wake up early tomorrow \Nand go fishing at the river.
24180,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Yeah.
24181,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.
24182,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Uh-huh, I can't wait."
24183,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,This is enough fish for a feast.
24184,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Yep.
24185,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,B-Big Brother...
24186,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Big Brother!
24187,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Reina, it's okay."
24188,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'll...
24189,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Your big brother will protect you!
24190,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I promised Mom!
24191,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I'll keep you safe!
24192,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Go away...
24193,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Go away!
24194,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"This is delicious, and very nutritious..."
24195,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,The ultimate food.
24196,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I need more of this species.
24197,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"They're the ones I mentioned on \Nthe phone, Gon and Killua."
24198,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, I'm Lin Koshi."
24199,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,N-Nice to meet you.
24200,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My name's Podungo Lapoy.
24201,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Glad to have you on board.
24202,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san."
24203,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Hey.
24204,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Let's get down to business.\NWhere was the leg discovered?
24205,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,On the beach over there.
24206,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"A-According to the locals, it washed up on sh-shore."
24207,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,There's a forest right behind us...
24208,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It'll be difficult to find the \NChimera Ant if it ran in there.
24209,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We can't be certain that it's still alive.
24210,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We don't even know if it ended up \Non the same island its leg drifted to.
24211,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Let's find out, then."
24212,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Here, remember this scent."
24213,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I'll help, too!"
24214,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Huh?
24215,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,His nose is as sharp as a dog's.
24216,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,He can't find anything...
24217,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,The scent may have disappeared.
24218,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It was raining.
24219,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"I couldn't find anything, either."
24220,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.
24221,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It may have washed ashore elsewhere.
24222,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,In which direction do the currents flow here?
24223,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's complicated...
24224,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,The direction is reversed\Nbetween day and night.
24225,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,And it also changes with the seasons.
24226,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I've even heard it's different on certain days.
24227,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...
24228,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,It's too early to give up.
24229,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Let's split up and search.
24230,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,You're right.
24231,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,No luck...
24232,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Continuing to search blindly is pointless.
24233,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Let's return to Yorknew City.
24234,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,We may be able to find a new lead.
24235,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Her length is at least two meters.
24236,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That thing could devour a human in no time.
24237,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,A voracious appetite...
24238,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Phagogenesis.
24239,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Your Majesty...
24240,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"Oh, you can speak?"
24241,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,"So that I may fully receive, understand, and execute your orders."
24242,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,That pleases me.
24243,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I assign you to be a squadron leader.
24244,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I am most grateful.
24245,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,I already have your mission.
24246,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Lead all the soldiers here on a mission to capture my food...
24247,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Capture more of those highly \Nnutritious organisms for me.
24248,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,At once!
24249,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.
24250,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Kite's worst fears have been realized.
24251,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,Next time: Very x Rapid x Reproduction.
24252,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My name is Gon Freecss.
24253,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,My name is Killua Zoldyck.
24254,Unease x And x Sighting.,77,What's your name?
24255,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Lead all the soldiers here on a mission to capture my food...
24256,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Capture more of those highly \Nnutritious organisms for me.
24257,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,At once!
24258,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Very x Rapid x Reproduction
24259,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Class-1 quarantined insects and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.
24260,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Once they've evolved beyond \Ntwo meters in length, humans no longer stand a chance."
24261,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Hey, what's that?"
24262,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,M-M-Monsters!
24263,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Listen carefully!
24264,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Target the fully grown ones. \NThey will provide the most nutrition.
24265,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Now go!
24266,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,A Chimera Ant queen moves repeatedly until she \Nfinds a place she likes.
24267,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"As she does, she births more and more \Nsoldier ants to build her own army."
24268,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Once she's chosen a location, she births a large number of carpenter ants, \Nwhich construct her castle with incredible speed."
24269,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"From then on, the queen remains \Nwithin the castle until death."
24270,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"So if a Queen grew to two meters tall and were to set her sights on humans, there should be entire villages \Nor towns of missing people."
24271,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I don't see anything...
24272,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"I just checked the past six months, and the largest group only numbered ten."
24273,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Say, can we look up missing people individually?"
24274,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Don't be ridiculous.
24275,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You know how many hundreds of thousands \Nof people go missing worldwide?
24276,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,We should be able to see which areas \Nhave the highest concentrations.
24277,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,No good... The data's two years old.
24278,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.
24279,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If someone saw a two-meter insect, \Nthey'd make a big fuss."
24280,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"We tried that, of course."
24281,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,But we couldn't find anything.
24282,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...
24283,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Yeah.
24284,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Bring up the tidal data from \Nthe day the arm was found.
24285,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,The arm was discovered here...
24286,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Now go back ten days.
24287,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Locate any currents that may have carried \Nthe arm to that location in that time.
24288,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What do you mean?
24289,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's possible that the arm was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.
24290,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That makes sense.
24291,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...
24292,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Including the Mitene Union.
24293,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,The Mitene Union...
24294,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is."
24295,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yes, as well as East Gorteau."
24296,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,There's no getting information \Nout of those two countries.
24297,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What's this NGL?
24298,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life."
24299,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"It's a country founded by people who wanted to \Nlive in nature, away from machine civilization."
24300,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Here.
24301,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,NGL Autonomous Region \N{\3c&H8F5AB8&
24302,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They primarily communicate by letter.
24303,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Primary means of transportation is by horse.
24304,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Anyone knowingly bringing technology into \Nthe country is subject to execution.
24305,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"In '87, a three-man TV crew was caught trying \Nto enter the country to get a story."
24306,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"One was executed, and the \Nother two remain in prison."
24307,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Of its 2.17 million population, \N99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party, with the rest being support volunteers."
24308,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there, how would the NGL citizenry react?"
24309,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They probably wouldn't do anything.
24310,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"When a deadly epidemic spread throughout \Nthe area, they let nature run its course, refusing to admit international doctors."
24311,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"And even if they tried to contact the outside, \Nit would be too late by the time word arrived."
24312,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen, she may have already begun to build her nest."
24313,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,A contest?
24314,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Yeah...
24315,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Between you and me.
24316,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.
24317,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I challenge you!
24318,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Hmph.
24319,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What?
24320,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You're running away?
24321,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Hey, accept my challenge!"
24322,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Accept?
24323,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Are you issuing an order?
24324,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Why should I follow an order from you?
24325,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I can only follow the Queen's orders.
24326,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You're just scared of losing.
24327,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.
24328,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I can beat any squadron in this castle!
24329,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Oh, I know..."
24330,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.
24331,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If we all compete, we'll capture more prey."
24332,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,More prey?
24333,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I see...
24334,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I agree with that idea.
24335,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased."
24336,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Okay, that settles it."
24337,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"However, I believe that the \Nprey's quality also matters."
24338,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,We must ensure that the Queen \Neats highly nutritious humans.
24339,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That guy's such a stiff...
24340,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That's what makes him endearing.
24341,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,He is dedicated and loyal.
24342,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I presume the human he was created \Nfrom was also quite earnest.
24343,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Hey, wait!"
24344,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Weren't you supposed to get some rest?
24345,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I'll bring her back.
24346,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Don't bother, it won't help."
24347,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"But she goes to the forest every morning, and she spends the whole day searching."
24348,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Right, she'll probably collapse soon..."
24349,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,But she can't stop looking.
24350,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That's what it means to be a parent.
24351,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,How many days has it been since \NKurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?
24352,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's like spirits whisked them away.
24353,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Big bugs...
24354,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Huh?
24355,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,We haven't raided this area yet.
24356,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Mom!
24357,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It must be them...
24358,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Those monsters must have stolen your children!
24359,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Excellent.
24360,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,This should suffice to please the Queen.
24361,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Wh-What's happening?
24362,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Exterminate the insects quickly.
24363,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That's Gyro's order.
24364,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Gyro? What's that?
24365,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Our king's name!
24366,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Damn!
24367,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.
24368,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"But to reach NGL, we have to take an airship to the neighboring \NRepublic of Rokario, and travel by land from there."
24369,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"It ""ant"" gonna be easy to get into \Na country of such nasty rumors."
24370,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Just kidding.
24371,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Nasty rumors?
24372,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What do you mean?
24373,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Have you heard of D²?
24374,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,D²?
24375,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly \Nthroughout urban areas worldwide.
24376,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"It's derived from the bila tree, \Nnative to the Mitene Union."
24377,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,And they claim that over 80% of the world's \Nbila trees are located in NGL.
24378,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,So the nasty rumors are saying that the \Ndrug is being manufactured in NGL?
24379,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They're only rumors.
24380,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,No one has been able to publicly prove it.
24381,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"After all, the country's locked down tight."
24382,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"When people try to get in to \Ninvestigate, they're executed."
24383,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Executed...
24384,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,He wasn't executed?
24385,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"No, if he'd been captured trying \Nto uncover NGL's secrets, he'd have probably been executed \Nlike that TV crewman."
24386,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"But this reporter was wearing a wire, from which we intercepted the final message."
24387,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,When the message was played...
24388,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,M-Monsters...
24389,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Giant bugs!
24390,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Giant bugs?
24391,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What do you think?
24392,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That isn't enough information to be sure...
24393,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"As a Magical Beast Hunter, \NI'll have to see for myself."
24394,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Then that settles it.
24395,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I'll get three tickets.
24396,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Make it four.
24397,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Ponzu...
24398,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I'm coming with you.
24399,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You can't.
24400,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"This is too dangerous, and you don't have a professional license yet."
24401,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,And we're talking about NGL...
24402,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That's why I should come.
24403,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.
24404,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If they discover you with cell phones \Nor wireless communicators, you'll be arrested right away."
24405,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"So if there's any trouble, you'll need me..."
24406,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Or rather, you'll need them."
24407,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They can carry a letter anywhere.
24408,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I get it.
24409,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They'll certainly come in handy.
24410,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"It may be a bit late to ask, but are you sure you want to come?"
24411,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Of course!
24412,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"You weren't kidding about the ""late"" part."
24413,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.
24414,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"There may very well be a swarm \Nof giant Chimera Ants already, hunting humans down."
24415,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If that turns out to be the case, my priority will be saving them."
24416,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,So I may not be able to help you.
24417,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You must be able to protect yourselves.
24418,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If you want to come, that's the requirement."
24419,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Okay, got it."
24420,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,We'll be fine.
24421,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"And if I'm the one who's in danger, you should escape without me."
24422,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Got it?
24423,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,A pretty good haul.
24424,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,But it's not even half the size of \Nwhat my squadron delivered...
24425,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,My focus was quality.
24426,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,And I wasn't competing against you.
24427,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Whatever.
24428,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Anyway, did you hear?"
24429,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That turtle guy ran into human resistance.
24430,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Resistance?
24431,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Hmm, those were probably guns."
24432,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Guns?
24433,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Put simply, it's a barrel that launches \Nmetal projectiles called bullets using the explosive force of gunpowder."
24434,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's one of the most commonly \Nused human weapons.
24435,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,No idea what you're talking about...
24436,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If you want the details, read books."
24437,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Books are wonderful.
24438,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"You can learn about how these \Nhuman creatures think, behave, and function as a society."
24439,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Can you answer my question, then?"
24440,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Do humans have armies too?
24441,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Armies?
24442,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yes, that was an army."
24443,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"They belong to a military body \Nled by an authoritative figure, much like ourselves!"
24444,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Ah, I have another question."
24445,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They mentioned something about a name.
24446,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,A name?
24447,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I can't blame you for not understanding.
24448,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Because it's a human idea \Nwe do not make use of.
24449,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Put simply...
24450,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,So it seems there are humans capable of more than running and crying.
24451,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I don't know why that should surprise you.
24452,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Given how different you and I are, it's only natural that individual humans \Nwould have unique traits as well."
24453,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"After all, their blood flows through us."
24454,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
24455,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
24456,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,The Queen summons us.
24457,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Assemble, squadron leaders!"
24458,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Do you get a headache when \Nthe Queen calls to us?
24459,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yeah, my ears start ringing."
24460,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.
24461,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I shall now begin preparations \Nfor the King's birth.
24462,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Every day, provide me with fifty humans."
24463,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yes, Majesty!"
24464,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Your Majesty, may I ask a question?"
24465,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Permitted. Speak.
24466,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves, with weapons to use against us."
24467,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"We must fortify our defenses, in preparation for any potential attack."
24468,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I have a few ideas... \NWould you care to hear them?
24469,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I shall let you decide your course.
24470,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I must focus entirely on my son.
24471,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yes, and one more thing..."
24472,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Would you allow us to have names?
24473,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What is a name?
24474,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,It's like a code that can be \Nused to identify each of us.
24475,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Very well, do as you like."
24476,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I am truly grateful!
24477,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,How peculiar.
24478,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,They speak their minds and \Nrequest to use these names.
24479,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"While bettering the race, they compete for glory, leading to a stronger sense of individuality."
24480,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I suppose I am also peculiar to \Nfind this change fascinating.
24481,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Perhaps I, too, have traces \Nof human blood within me."
24482,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Regardless, I feel quite confident now."
24483,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"I can see you already, as though \Nrecalling a memory from my past."
24484,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,My King...
24485,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You shall stand atop this world!
24486,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Names... Quite amusing.
24487,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,The King's three Royal Guards.
24488,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I shall name you myself.
24489,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,What did you just decide?
24490,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Remember what Kite said before we left?
24491,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That we should escape without \Nhim if he's in danger.
24492,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Yeah, I don't think it was a choice..."
24493,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Yeah.
24494,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"That's why neither of us said anything, but I've been thinking."
24495,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect, to be in that much danger?"
24496,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You said that Ging had a reason for \Nbringing Kite and me together...
24497,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Yeah.
24498,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You're probably right.
24499,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"I don't know the reason, but I can't give up halfway, \Nno matter what's going on."
24500,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging."
24501,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Of course, I could never forgive myself, either."
24502,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,So I won't run away.
24503,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,That's what I've decided.
24504,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Man, you had this totally serious expression, so I was expecting something big."
24505,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,But it's just business as usual.
24506,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Huh? I thought about this a lot.
24507,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...
24508,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon."
24509,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"If someone said you should abandon them, you'd never do it."
24510,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You make it sound like I wasted \Nmy time considering it.
24511,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Then what about you?
24512,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think \Nabout it when the time comes."
24513,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,You mean you might run away?
24514,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Depends.
24515,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I can't say until it actually happens.
24516,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Say for instance...
24517,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I can't tell you what I'd do in \Na hypothetical situation.
24518,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,I don't decide until it's time.
24519,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"The airship carrying the group \Nheads for the Mitene Union, still unaware of the cruel fate \Nthat lies in wait for them..."
24520,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Next time: No x Good x NGL.
24521,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,"Ready, start!"
24522,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur...
24523,Very x Rapid x Reproduction.,78,And there's your outtake!
24524,No x Good x NGL.,79,Would you allow us to have names?
24525,No x Good x NGL.,79,What is a name?
24526,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's like a code that can be \Nused to identify each of us.
24527,No x Good x NGL.,79,Names... Quite amusing.
24528,No x Good x NGL.,79,The King's three Royal Guards.
24529,No x Good x NGL.,79,I shall name you myself.
24530,No x Good x NGL.,79,No x Good x NGL
24531,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yorknew City
24532,No x Good x NGL.,79,Mitene Union
24533,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Seeking the giant Chimera Ant,"
24534,No x Good x NGL.,79,Mitene Union: \N\N{\3c&H42C095&
24535,No x Good x NGL.,79,Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.
24536,No x Good x NGL.,79,{\3c&H42C095&
24537,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region."
24538,No x Good x NGL.,79,"NGL, huh?"
24539,No x Good x NGL.,79,They believe living naturally is always better.
24540,No x Good x NGL.,79,"They may be weird for living there, but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too."
24541,No x Good x NGL.,79,"No idea what's going on, but I've already driven in about \Nten similar groups today alone."
24542,No x Good x NGL.,79,Ten groups?!
24543,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yeah.
24544,No x Good x NGL.,79,Then it sounds like we're \Namong the last to arrive.
24545,No x Good x NGL.,79,They're probably other pro Hunter teams.
24546,No x Good x NGL.,79,All looking for the giant insects?
24547,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Yeah, those veterans are good."
24548,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Somehow, they've managed \Nto obtain this information."
24549,No x Good x NGL.,79,But are there really bugs large enough to attack humans?
24550,No x Good x NGL.,79,"It defies common sense, but that voice they heard over the transmitter..."
24551,No x Good x NGL.,79,M-Monsters...
24552,No x Good x NGL.,79,Giant bugs!
24553,No x Good x NGL.,79,It could be some other kind of organism.
24554,No x Good x NGL.,79,"NGL is one big nature reserve, so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms \Nthat haven't been reported in academic circles."
24555,No x Good x NGL.,79,It wouldn't be strange if there are \Ninsects that attack humans.
24556,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Even if there aren't any giant bugs, this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the \Nexistence of any unidentified organisms."
24557,No x Good x NGL.,79,"As a new Magical Beast Hunter, \NI need to produce results."
24558,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Now that I'm here, I have \Nto accomplish something."
24559,No x Good x NGL.,79,"According to the scouts that \Nwent out first thing this morning, a new human village has been discovered in sector MA18, in the southwest."
24560,No x Good x NGL.,79,"There are twelve houses, with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents."
24561,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Hey, that's pretty big."
24562,No x Good x NGL.,79,Guess there are still a few large villages left.
24563,No x Good x NGL.,79,I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.
24564,No x Good x NGL.,79,Then I will add this village to our \Nlist of targets for the day.
24565,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Colt, could you make the trip?"
24566,No x Good x NGL.,79,Roger.
24567,No x Good x NGL.,79,"What's this, Peggy?"
24568,No x Good x NGL.,79,You aren't sending me?
24569,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Cheetu, I need you to go northwest, \Nas originally planned."
24570,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Zazan, you accompany him."
24571,No x Good x NGL.,79,There aren't any large villages \Nleft in the northwest.
24572,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Even if there were, there probably \Naren't any strong, young humans."
24573,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's more fun when I get to chase them around.
24574,No x Good x NGL.,79,Cheetu!
24575,No x Good x NGL.,79,We do not hunt for amusement.
24576,No x Good x NGL.,79,We serve the Queen.
24577,No x Good x NGL.,79,We need only capture the \Nrequested number of humans.
24578,No x Good x NGL.,79,"I know that, Colt."
24579,No x Good x NGL.,79,We'll get the job done.
24580,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Right, Zazan?"
24581,No x Good x NGL.,79,I'll fulfill the quota.
24582,No x Good x NGL.,79,But I don't need you telling \Nme how to hunt my prey.
24583,No x Good x NGL.,79,I'll do things my own way.
24584,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's fun to hunt humans when \Nthey're running around.
24585,No x Good x NGL.,79,What did you say?
24586,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Well, there you go."
24587,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Let's go, Zazan."
24588,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Colt, don't get too worked up."
24589,No x Good x NGL.,79,You'll have an easier time if you learn to relax.
24590,No x Good x NGL.,79,They dare do things their own way?
24591,No x Good x NGL.,79,"At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!"
24592,No x Good x NGL.,79,"While the use of names is convenient for leading the troops, we don't want to encourage too much individuality."
24593,No x Good x NGL.,79,Their behavior could lead to \Na breakdown in command.
24594,No x Good x NGL.,79,We must take steps.
24595,No x Good x NGL.,79,I agree that something must be done.
24596,No x Good x NGL.,79,Meleoron and Yunju have yet to \Nshow themselves at a war council.
24597,No x Good x NGL.,79,Meleoron!
24598,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Stop hiding, and show yourself!"
24599,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Just to be clear, it isn't my fault Yunju is absent."
24600,No x Good x NGL.,79,You were hiding because you \Nthought you'd be blamed?
24601,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're supposed to be a squadron leader.
24602,No x Good x NGL.,79,Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?
24603,No x Good x NGL.,79,See? I'm the one getting yelled at.
24604,No x Good x NGL.,79,That's why I didn't want to come out.
24605,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's always my fault.
24606,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.
24607,No x Good x NGL.,79,And further...
24608,No x Good x NGL.,79,I'll talk!
24609,No x Good x NGL.,79,It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.
24610,No x Good x NGL.,79,He's the one who ran off on \Nhis own to hunt humans.
24611,No x Good x NGL.,79,What? Toward which sector?
24612,No x Good x NGL.,79,Was a new village discovered?
24613,No x Good x NGL.,79,That's not it!
24614,No x Good x NGL.,79,You remember the humans who fought back?
24615,No x Good x NGL.,79,The ones who were armed with guns.
24616,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yunju was all worked up about making them his pets.
24617,No x Good x NGL.,79,Come on! What are you doing?
24618,No x Good x NGL.,79,I accidentally stepped on you.
24619,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're supposed to entertain us more!
24620,No x Good x NGL.,79,That's right!
24621,No x Good x NGL.,79,Run for your lives!
24622,No x Good x NGL.,79,Until you're dead.
24623,No x Good x NGL.,79,This is the border with NGL.
24624,No x Good x NGL.,79,Those two huge trees serve as \Nthe checkpoint and embassy.
24625,No x Good x NGL.,79,"What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?"
24626,No x Good x NGL.,79,These people are all so weird.
24627,No x Good x NGL.,79,Stay alert.
24628,No x Good x NGL.,79,"The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is \Nmore than a nature-loving organization."
24629,No x Good x NGL.,79,Got it.
24630,No x Good x NGL.,79,What brings you here?
24631,No x Good x NGL.,79,We're on a hunt.
24632,No x Good x NGL.,79,A quarantined organism may \Nhave invaded this country.
24633,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you are pro Hunters, then we cannot deny you entry."
24634,No x Good x NGL.,79,Follow me.
24635,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're using computers and machines.
24636,No x Good x NGL.,79,This place isn't within NGL's borders.
24637,No x Good x NGL.,79,This area is used for foreign relations \Nand information exchange.
24638,No x Good x NGL.,79,Are there any facilities similar \Nto this within the country?
24639,No x Good x NGL.,79,"No, not a single one."
24640,No x Good x NGL.,79,No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.
24641,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Naturally, visitors are also not allowed to bring any inside."
24642,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Which means that you'll need \Nto remove all metallic, petroleum, glass, or other \Nsuch goods on your person."
24643,No x Good x NGL.,79,D-Does that include my glasses?
24644,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yes.
24645,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If your clothes, belts, shoes, or \Nunderwear contain any plastic, chemicals, or metal, you must remove them."
24646,No x Good x NGL.,79,That isn't funny.
24647,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're telling us to strip naked?
24648,No x Good x NGL.,79,Don't worry.
24649,No x Good x NGL.,79,There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.
24650,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Also, if there are any bolts inside \Nyour body, dental implants, gold, silver, or silicon enhancements that cannot be removed, \Nyou will not be allowed to enter."
24651,No x Good x NGL.,79,Shop
24652,No x Good x NGL.,79,Only the five of us are left?
24653,No x Good x NGL.,79,I want you to stand by in the closest town.
24654,No x Good x NGL.,79,We'll return here within two \Nweeks and contact you.
24655,No x Good x NGL.,79,Got it.
24656,No x Good x NGL.,79,The checkpoint is over there.
24657,No x Good x NGL.,79,"There will be a physical exam and interview, as well as metal, x-ray, and ultrasound scanning."
24658,No x Good x NGL.,79,The security is rather strict.
24659,No x Good x NGL.,79,Some people have smuggled in guns by \Nhiding the parts inside their bodies.
24660,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's common for people to hide cameras \Nor cell phones in their rectums.
24661,No x Good x NGL.,79,Some people even trained animals to bring them laptops once they were inside.
24662,No x Good x NGL.,79,All of you are clean.
24663,No x Good x NGL.,79,Thank you for your patience.
24664,No x Good x NGL.,79,Please pass through.
24665,No x Good x NGL.,79,Welcome to NGL.
24666,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Okay, let's begin the hunt."
24667,No x Good x NGL.,79,Horse Rental \N12000 per day
24668,No x Good x NGL.,79,Any sightings of giant insects?
24669,No x Good x NGL.,79,I haven't heard anything.
24670,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Even if there were any such creatures, the citizens in this country wouldn't \Nmake much of a fuss."
24671,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If we are attacked and killed by animals, that is simply nature taking its course."
24672,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Anyway, we should follow the \Ncoast and check the villages."
24673,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If we go through all of them \Nand nothing turns up, it probably isn't in this country."
24674,No x Good x NGL.,79,That's assuming those guys \Nwere telling the truth.
24675,No x Good x NGL.,79,"They're still following us, aren't they?"
24676,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yeah...
24677,No x Good x NGL.,79,They claim to be here in case we encounter unknown tribes and \Nrequire interpreters or intermediaries.
24678,No x Good x NGL.,79,But they're obviously here to watch us.
24679,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Well, I never expected the people \Nhere to be of any help."
24680,No x Good x NGL.,79,My gut tells me that it's here.
24681,No x Good x NGL.,79,Don't move.
24682,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you die, it won't be my fault."
24683,No x Good x NGL.,79,A-A mere animal shouldn't order \Na superior human around!
24684,No x Good x NGL.,79,Mere animal? Superior human?
24685,No x Good x NGL.,79,I don't understand...
24686,No x Good x NGL.,79,How are you and I different?
24687,No x Good x NGL.,79,Shut up!
24688,No x Good x NGL.,79,Good grief...
24689,No x Good x NGL.,79,Didn't your parents ever teach you to answer a question when you're asked?
24690,No x Good x NGL.,79,"There's no hope for you, old-timer."
24691,No x Good x NGL.,79,Try harder in your next life.
24692,No x Good x NGL.,79,Now you've done it.
24693,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you kill him, we aren't able to store him."
24694,No x Good x NGL.,79,I can make meatballs to serve \Nto the Queen within the day.
24695,No x Good x NGL.,79,People like him irritate me.
24696,No x Good x NGL.,79,They don't know their place.
24697,No x Good x NGL.,79,I prefer to see them running around in fear.
24698,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Yesterday, you shot one in \Nthe back when they ran."
24699,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you'd let me handle this, I could secure \Nour prey in a smarter fashion."
24700,No x Good x NGL.,79,"When you said, ""Don't move,"" \Nthat was meant for me, right?"
24701,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?"
24702,No x Good x NGL.,79,Don't get too cocky.
24703,No x Good x NGL.,79,"I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide."
24704,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you enjoy killing so much, you should \Nvolunteer for the feeding squad."
24705,No x Good x NGL.,79,No hope...
24706,No x Good x NGL.,79,Damn that Yunju.
24707,No x Good x NGL.,79,Shut up!
24708,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you don't shut up, I'll eat you right here!"
24709,No x Good x NGL.,79,Rammot!
24710,No x Good x NGL.,79,What are you doing?
24711,No x Good x NGL.,79,What am I doing? \NI'm transporting the food.
24712,No x Good x NGL.,79,Isn't that obvious?
24713,No x Good x NGL.,79,Be more selective with your prey!
24714,No x Good x NGL.,79,How often do I have to repeat myself?
24715,No x Good x NGL.,79,That human won't serve any purpose.
24716,No x Good x NGL.,79,And we've already met our quota for the day.
24717,No x Good x NGL.,79,You're wasting your time.
24718,No x Good x NGL.,79,Then I'll eat it!
24719,No x Good x NGL.,79,What?
24720,No x Good x NGL.,79,"It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway."
24721,No x Good x NGL.,79,"This is an order, Rammot."
24722,No x Good x NGL.,79,Damn.
24723,No x Good x NGL.,79,Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.
24724,No x Good x NGL.,79,Huh?
24725,No x Good x NGL.,79,I don't see any problem.
24726,No x Good x NGL.,79,I enjoy what I do.
24727,No x Good x NGL.,79,You want to take this one?
24728,No x Good x NGL.,79,"I guess it's dead, so you can't."
24729,No x Good x NGL.,79,Which squadron are you from?
24730,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Oh, Zazan..."
24731,No x Good x NGL.,79,That nasty woman.
24732,No x Good x NGL.,79,You have my sympathy.
24733,No x Good x NGL.,79,You could join Yunju's team.
24734,No x Good x NGL.,79,I hear that they're allowed to \Nkill any humans they want.
24735,No x Good x NGL.,79,"If you take this as a gift, they'll probably let you join on the spot."
24736,No x Good x NGL.,79,What is this?
24737,No x Good x NGL.,79,It's terrible...
24738,No x Good x NGL.,79,Who did this?
24739,No x Good x NGL.,79,A gun?
24740,No x Good x NGL.,79,People are fighting with guns!
24741,No x Good x NGL.,79,Who could it be?
24742,No x Good x NGL.,79,Guns aren't allowed in NGL!
24743,No x Good x NGL.,79,They're members of the NGL \Nunderground that manufactures D².
24744,No x Good x NGL.,79,Huh?
24745,No x Good x NGL.,79,I don't think these wounds \Nwere inflicted by humans.
24746,No x Good x NGL.,79,Does that mean...
24747,No x Good x NGL.,79,I can't be certain yet...
24748,No x Good x NGL.,79,"But if the monster we seek \Nwas responsible for this, we won't be able to handle it \Nwith our current members."
24749,No x Good x NGL.,79,Th-There they are!
24750,No x Good x NGL.,79,Monsters!
24751,No x Good x NGL.,79,Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!
24752,No x Good x NGL.,79,Run on my signal.
24753,No x Good x NGL.,79,Got it?
24754,No x Good x NGL.,79,Rainbow!
24755,No x Good x NGL.,79,Seven Spectrum Array
24756,No x Good x NGL.,79,Red Arrow
24757,No x Good x NGL.,79,Red Arrow!
24758,No x Good x NGL.,79,Now!
24759,No x Good x NGL.,79,No hope.
24760,No x Good x NGL.,79,Over here!
24761,No x Good x NGL.,79,Are you okay?
24762,No x Good x NGL.,79,Yes...
24763,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Anyway, we should contact \Nthe other pro Hunters."
24764,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Can you handle that, Ponzu?"
24765,No x Good x NGL.,79,Got it.
24766,No x Good x NGL.,79,What? That's it?
24767,No x Good x NGL.,79,"No, there are more."
24768,No x Good x NGL.,79,There sure are!
24769,No x Good x NGL.,79,I can smell living humans!
24770,No x Good x NGL.,79,"What do we do, Zaikahal?"
24771,No x Good x NGL.,79,"As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage, they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler."
24772,No x Good x NGL.,79,A storm brews in NGL.
24773,No x Good x NGL.,79,And Gon's group is heading straight for it.
24774,No x Good x NGL.,79,Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.
24775,No x Good x NGL.,79,"Gon, what's wrong?"
24776,No x Good x NGL.,79,Do you have a fever?
24777,No x Good x NGL.,79,What? A crick in your back?
24778,No x Good x NGL.,79,Terrible...
24779,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"What do we do, Zaikahal?"
24780,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Evil x and x Terrible
24781,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,His name is Gyro.
24782,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.
24783,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro spent his first twelve years in a construction camp.
24784,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"By the time he said his first word, he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete."
24785,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,His father forced him to slave away... until Gyro finally killed him and fled.
24786,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"His father, who raised Gyro \Nalone, was a silent man."
24787,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"When his father returned from work, he drank cheap liquor by himself \Nuntil he went to bed."
24788,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He very rarely talked to Gyro, \Nwho was on the upper bunk."
24789,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Thus, Gyro barely knew how to speak before the age of seven."
24790,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"When Gyro returned from work, he was not permitted to leave his bed, except when visiting the restroom."
24791,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He was allowed to relieve himself twice \Na day, and only before 9 PM."
24792,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly \Nwhenever he turned in his sleep.
24793,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,His father hated that sound.
24794,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"After his father once severely \Nbeat him because of that noise,"
24795,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.
24796,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He also learned to control his bladder at night, keeping an empty liquor bottle \Nfor when he couldn't hold it."
24797,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"""Don't make trouble for others."""
24798,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,That was the one lesson his \Nsilent father taught him.
24799,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"From a young age, Gyro did \Nhis best to adhere to it, learning from his mistakes."
24800,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Since his father had never \Nbought him even one toy, this lesson was his one and \Nonly gift from his father."
24801,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Within his small world, \Nhis father was essentially God."
24802,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"And no matter how cruel his father could be,"
24803,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Gyro continued to idolize him, believing that his father needed him."
24804,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This belief stemmed from two facts...
24805,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"When Gyro was five, a terrible fever nearly killed him."
24806,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"All night, his father stayed up, \Nreplacing his towels with fresh ones."
24807,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,And the other reason was... that his father had never \Nonce ordered him to leave.
24808,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro was proud of these two facts.
24809,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"""Idiot..."
24810,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He hasn't kicked you out \Nbecause you bring in money!"""
24811,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Though he had previously kept that \Npossibility locked away deep in his mind,"
24812,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro snapped when the older youth \Ninsensitively brought it to light.
24813,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Regretting that he'd revealed his secret, \NGyro was furious with himself."
24814,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"His pride wounded, rage overcame \Nhim, and he attacked the youth."
24815,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"The youth had always mocked the timid boy, so when the boy fought back, \Nhe went mad with anger, to the point where not even \Nknocking him out would satisfy him."
24816,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He stomped on the boy's face, spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:"
24817,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"""When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!"
24818,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Your old man was drinking by himself as always.
24819,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this."
24820,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"But that night, the neighbor had \Na fight with your old man."
24821,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.
24822,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Let me tell you what your old man said.
24823,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It wouldn't matter.
24824,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I don't care if he dies.
24825,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"You hear that?"""
24826,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"As Gyro listened to the youth, he witnessed something inconceivable."
24827,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"His father looked him in the eye, paid him no attention, and then left."
24828,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,That was when Gyro finally understood.
24829,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The universe doesn't give a damn about me.
24830,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,My father doesn't care if I live or die.
24831,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"In other words, my life has no meaning."
24832,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"If I live, I'll bring in money."
24833,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all."
24834,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,My father told me not to \Nmake trouble for others so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.
24835,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It was never a lesson to help his son.
24836,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It was fully for his own benefit.
24837,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"In that lesson, ""others"" meant my father."
24838,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,No...
24839,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"It meant ""humans."""
24840,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Don't make trouble for humans.
24841,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I must not be human...
24842,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Eventually, the boy stood up, grabbing a nearby hammer."
24843,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL."
24844,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Nine years after that, NGL became \Na nation, with him as its king."
24845,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.
24846,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The drug D² was merely the first step.
24847,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Yunju!
24848,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.
24849,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I didn't feel like fighting.
24850,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Either way, the food will reach the Queen."
24851,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I just want to enjoy the hunt.
24852,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gyro...
24853,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Damn, I should have just eaten him!"
24854,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Listen up!
24855,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I'm taking over this factory!
24856,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"From today on, this is my fortress!"
24857,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This is awesome!
24858,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This is bad.
24859,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,These creatures are too dangerous!
24860,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Look!
24861,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What...
24862,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What is happening in this place?
24863,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What? More dead soldiers found?
24864,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered."
24865,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Plus, one of mine is missing..."
24866,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Its communication has been cut \Noff, and it hasn't returned."
24867,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Yunju's team dealt with the \Nhumans holding guns.
24868,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Does this mean there are other \Nhumans who are resisting us?
24869,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Sounds that way...
24870,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,But the dead soldiers were killed \Nby something that wasn't a gun.
24871,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Something?
24872,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What could it have been?
24873,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,How would I know?
24874,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.
24875,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Where are the corpses?
24876,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Peggy's examining them above.
24877,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This one was killed by a gun.
24878,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.
24879,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,But I'm not sure about the others.
24880,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The skull was punctured.
24881,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Yes, but not by a gun."
24882,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,And I had difficulty understanding the soldiers' explanation of the events...
24883,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"As it is, the foot soldiers' communications \Nare simplistic and just to the point."
24884,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"They said one human mimicked firing \Na gun, and no projectile emerged, but something pierced the \Nsoldier's skulls and they fell, dead."
24885,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Can't some soldiers both see \Nand feel what's happening?
24886,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You're correct.
24887,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Those soldiers said that they \Nfelt a projectile being fired.
24888,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,So they possess abilities that we do not...
24889,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,These humans could prove tougher \Nopponents than anticipated.
24890,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"If humans have this power, once we \Ninherit their genes, we also will."
24891,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We only lack the trait.
24892,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You don't understand...
24893,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The humans' strength lies\Nin their ability to learn.
24894,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"If they learn that the Queen \Nis where we're vulnerable, they'll do whatever it takes to kill her."
24895,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Hmm?
24896,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You're the one who doesn't understand!
24897,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,That just means we need to do \Nwhatever it takes to keep her safe.
24898,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Am I wrong?
24899,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"No, you're correct..."
24900,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,That's right.
24901,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I will protect her...
24902,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I will protect Reina!
24903,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Reina?
24904,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Who's Reina?
24905,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Uh, you're the one who said that name!"
24906,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I did?
24907,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I didn't say anything.
24908,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You must be hearing things.
24909,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Anyway, the problem is that humans \Npossess multiple weapons capable of defeating our foot soldiers."
24910,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What should we do?
24911,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Use their weapons against them.
24912,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Give them a taste of their own medicine.
24913,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity \Nto manipulate complex weaponry.
24914,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,But the humans don't know that.
24915,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,They must be very frightened.
24916,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I understand...
24917,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You're a better strategist than I am.
24918,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Reina?
24919,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It didn't work...
24920,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,No one received the message.
24921,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,That means all the other Hunters I was \Nin contact with have been taken out.
24922,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Oh...
24923,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We should leave.
24924,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Those creatures are too much for us to handle.
24925,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We need to leave NGL and tell \Nthe world what's happening...
24926,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,So that an extermination force can be formed.
24927,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Whatever... Let's just run for it!
24928,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Or we'll all be—
24929,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I-It's here!
24930,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Run!
24931,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,More will be coming!
24932,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Hold on, now..."
24933,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I said to capture the humans alive.
24934,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We're supposed to deliver \Nthem to the Queen fresh.
24935,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,A-A human face...
24936,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What is that thing?!
24937,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Fire...
24938,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Open fire!
24939,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Orange Arrow
24940,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"He grabbed my Orange Arrow, fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease."
24941,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Huh? This is clearly visible.
24942,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The grunts couldn't see this?
24943,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,So the life energy that surrounds your body is \Nwhat fuels this weapon?
24944,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You will make a magnificent \Nmeal for the Queen...
24945,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Balda!
24946,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"O-Oh, no!"
24947,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I took a bite without thinking...
24948,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Zazan-sama will be angry again!
24949,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You bastard!
24950,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,O-One moment...
24951,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,My hands are full.
24952,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Take this!
24953,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"As always, you're a disgrace in battle."
24954,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Zazan-sama...
24955,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?
24956,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Oh!
24957,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You're right.
24958,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We're going back.
24959,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Hmm?
24960,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Since we've obtained some excellent food.
24961,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,He probably has the nutritional value \Nof a thousand normal humans.
24962,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Well done, Pike."
24963,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Zazan-sama!
24964,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I am most grateful for your praise...
24965,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,You honor me!
24966,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Don't forget the food.
24967,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Oh, yes..."
24968,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I can't save him myself...
24969,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I have to call for help!
24970,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,There's still... There's still time!
24971,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Even if they take him, they \Nwon't eat him immediately..."
24972,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Please...
24973,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Find a Hunter with a strong aura!
24974,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,I must hurry back to the border!
24975,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Other Hunters should be there—
24976,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,So much fun...
24977,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Hunting is so much fun!
24978,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Help!!
24979,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Help!!\N\NChimera Ant Nest
24980,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Rocky Area
24981,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Notify the Hunter Association!!
24982,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It'll be dangerous.
24983,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,But could you accompany me?
24984,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Of course.
24985,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,We're pros.
24986,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Miss interpreter...
24987,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Sorry, but we're in a hurry."
24988,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Yes.
24989,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The horses can move a bit faster.
24990,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,They won't be fast enough.
24991,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"I want you two to return to \Nthe border, find the others, and get word to the Association."
24992,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,These creatures are dangerous.
24993,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Got it.
24994,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Be careful, Kite."
24995,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Right.
24996,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind."
24997,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Right back at you.
24998,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,All ready to go!
24999,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Let's go.
25000,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This is a bullet casing.
25001,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?"
25002,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,So the underground rulers of NGL were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.
25003,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,But judging by this...
25004,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,It wasn't done by a human.
25005,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant."
25006,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,If the Chimera Ants are using guns...
25007,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,"I hate to consider the possibility, but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers have already been fed to the queen..."
25008,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,What will happen if Chimera Ants \Nare born with their genes?
25009,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,NGL and Chimera Ants...
25010,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The worst combination imaginable.
25011,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,This could create an unprecedented biohazard.
25012,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,The situation has taken a sudden \Nturn for the absolute worst.
25013,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Next time: The x Fight x Begins.
25014,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Ready...
25015,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Set...
25016,Evil x and x Terrible.,80,Gon!
25017,The x Fight x Begins.,81,This is a bullet casing.
25018,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?"
25019,The x Fight x Begins.,81,So the underground rulers of NGL were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.
25020,The x Fight x Begins.,81,But judging by this...
25021,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It wasn't done by a human.
25022,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant."
25023,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The x Fight x Begins
25024,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The Chimera Ants continue their \Nrampage throughout NGL.
25025,The x Fight x Begins.,81,And they've finally struck against the don who ruled this country from the shadows.
25026,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants have assumed control of NGL's interior.
25027,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The question is if we can reach their nest before the Queen births the King.
25028,The x Fight x Begins.,81,More!
25029,The x Fight x Begins.,81,More!
25030,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I need much more.
25031,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I need more food of high \Nnutritional value for my child.
25032,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Over a hundred a day?
25033,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Yes, the Queen has requested more food, to aid the King's growth."
25034,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We've been providing fifty a day.
25035,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Just when we'd managed to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...
25036,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If the Queen commands, we will double or triple our quota."
25037,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We should increase our ranks...
25038,The x Fight x Begins.,81,No.
25039,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Increasing them would be simple, but it \Nwould disturb the chain of command."
25040,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We must start by instilling more discipline.
25041,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We'll increase our ranks afterwards.
25042,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"First, we must eliminate sedition in all—"
25043,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't make me laugh!
25044,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That isn't going to be necessary.
25045,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The rare human I captured has the \Nnutritional value of a thousand normal ones.
25046,The x Fight x Begins.,81,One with the value of a thousand?
25047,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What are you talking about?
25048,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You didn't know?
25049,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm saying that some unique humans \Nare overflowing with life energy.
25050,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"They're hard to find, which is why they're rare."
25051,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Rare?
25052,The x Fight x Begins.,81,These special humans each have the \Nnutritional value of a thousand normal ones?
25053,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That's right.
25054,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Impossible!
25055,The x Fight x Begins.,81,No such human could—
25056,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They do exist...
25057,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I saw and fought one.
25058,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"And then, I accidentally took a bite!"
25059,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Pike!
25060,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.
25061,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Oh, yeah."
25062,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You're right.
25063,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't spout nonsense!
25064,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama."
25065,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I spoke nonsense? When?
25066,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You weren't the one who \Ncaptured the rare human.
25067,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I did.
25068,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Remember how you praised me \Nfor the wonderful job I did?
25069,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm the one who disabled him!
25070,The x Fight x Begins.,81,But I'm the one who held him in place—
25071,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Enough.
25072,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Make yourself scarce.
25073,The x Fight x Begins.,81,F-For...
25074,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Forgive me!
25075,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Was that story true?
25076,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama..."
25077,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Yes, there really was a rare human."
25078,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Not that!
25079,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Did you really take a bite?
25080,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"No, I took a bite of the normal \Nhuman, not of the rare—"
25081,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.
25082,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Consuming the Queen's food is not permitted.
25083,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"I'll never do it again, so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!"
25084,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Hold it! Come back here!
25085,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Bihorn.
25086,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Have you ever seen a rare human?
25087,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"No, I've only heard about them from Zazan."
25088,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Zazan, could you provide more detail \Nabout this rare human?"
25089,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Sure.
25090,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Arrows of light...
25091,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I understand.
25092,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.
25093,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Yes, that must be it."
25094,The x Fight x Begins.,81,One mystery has been solved.
25095,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers, an officer like Pike can see them."
25096,The x Fight x Begins.,81,See them and stop them.
25097,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"In other words, officers can capture them."
25098,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Yes, like I did."
25099,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That one was clearly different from \Nthe other humans we've captured.
25100,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Its whole body appeared to \Nbe shining with life energy.
25101,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That's how I knew that it would have the nutritional \Nvalue of over a thousand humans.
25102,The x Fight x Begins.,81,More than ten days' worth in one human?
25103,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If that's true, we're saved."
25104,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It'd be far easier than carrying a hundred humans around each day.
25105,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If we find one on the first day, \Nwe can rest the next nine."
25106,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Fool!
25107,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They're rare because they're hard to find!
25108,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What? Again?
25109,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Understood.
25110,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Is something wrong?
25111,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Rammot is acting without my permission again.
25112,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Damn!
25113,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Why am I stuck eating horses?
25114,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Damn...
25115,The x Fight x Begins.,81,This is all Colt's fault.
25116,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I want to eat humans!
25117,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"First, I have to deal with Rammot."
25118,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Otherwise, it sets a bad example."
25119,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What is this presence?
25120,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Could it be?
25121,The x Fight x Begins.,81,No one's here.
25122,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Say...
25123,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Something smells.
25124,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Coming from over there.
25125,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It's like a morning sacrifice.
25126,The x Fight x Begins.,81,A ritual practiced by birds \Ncalled bull-headed shrikes.
25127,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"They impale their prey on sharp \Nobjects, such as branches."
25128,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Hey!
25129,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Wha?
25130,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Wh-What is that?
25131,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They're capable of concealing their presence?
25132,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Trash.
25133,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Those are mine!
25134,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Ow!
25135,The x Fight x Begins.,81,This guy is strong.
25136,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Fighting him won't be easy.
25137,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Gon... Killua...
25138,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You two must deal with him yourselves.
25139,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That is a Chimera Ant soldier.
25140,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We will encounter many more like him.
25141,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I won't be able to help you during combat.
25142,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave."
25143,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You'll just be in my way.
25144,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Weren't you listening, Kite?"
25145,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We are also pros!
25146,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't treat us like kids!
25147,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What trick is this?
25148,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Suddenly, they feel far stronger."
25149,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Time to test it!
25150,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Thunderbolt
25151,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Thunderbolt!
25152,The x Fight x Begins.,81,First comes rock...
25153,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Rock...
25154,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Paper...
25155,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Rock!
25156,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Yes! Just enough!
25157,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Bastards!
25158,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm gonna eat you!
25159,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I will! Remember this!
25160,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Our attacks...
25161,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They didn't work.
25162,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That guy's smart.
25163,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"He let his soldier do the fighting, \Nso he could learn our abilities."
25164,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Are you coming?
25165,The x Fight x Begins.,81,There's no need to feel down. \NYour attacks weren't that bad.
25166,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You just need experience now.
25167,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If you wish to become stronger, \Nthis is a perfect opportunity."
25168,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"But if you aren't prepared, you won't \Nbe able to endure the ordeal."
25169,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Whether we win or lose, hell lies ahead of us."
25170,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We're coming.
25171,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Yeah.
25172,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That hurts...
25173,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Damn...
25174,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't lay a finger on them.
25175,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm gonna get my revenge.
25176,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll kill them...
25177,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll eat them all!
25178,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm willing to let you kill them.
25179,The x Fight x Begins.,81,But you may not eat them.
25180,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Bodies brimming with so much life \Nenergy provide the finest nutrition.
25181,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They must be fed to the Queen.
25182,The x Fight x Begins.,81,No way! Killing them won't be enough!
25183,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"I have to tear them to shreds, \Nfill my belly with them..."
25184,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Crap on their skulls, and crush them!"
25185,The x Fight x Begins.,81,And even still...
25186,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That still may not be enough to quell my fury!
25187,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I won't be satisfied with just killing them!
25188,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't get above yourself.
25189,The x Fight x Begins.,81,This is an order.
25190,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You would defy your leader's command?
25191,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It isn't just Yunju's team.
25192,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The other teams do it all the time.
25193,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Cheetu and Hagya's teams \Ndo whatever they want.
25194,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Their leaders enjoy the hunt!
25195,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Is that true?
25196,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Yeah!
25197,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"They chase humans, kill them, then leave the dead bodies there."
25198,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"None of the other squadrons just haul \Nbodies back like industrious little drones, my dear leader Colt."
25199,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll transfer to a different squad if \Nthat's what it takes to kill them.
25200,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Damn, it hurts!"
25201,The x Fight x Begins.,81,A reason?
25202,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Because it's fun, of course."
25203,The x Fight x Begins.,81,It's good that humans know how to speak.
25204,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"That way, we know what \Nthey think as they die."
25205,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.
25206,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Yep, it's great!"
25207,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Once you've tried it, you can never go back."
25208,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?"
25209,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You're wrong about one thing...
25210,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.
25211,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.
25212,The x Fight x Begins.,81,However...
25213,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You shouldn't waste the Queen's \Nprecious food for sport.
25214,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Precious food?
25215,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Don't make me laugh.
25216,The x Fight x Begins.,81,There are more of them than she'll ever need.
25217,The x Fight x Begins.,81,They're trash!
25218,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'm just taking out the trash.
25219,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Got a problem with that?
25220,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Not at all!
25221,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Do you know about the rare humans?
25222,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Rare humans?
25223,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Oh...
25224,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The ones that are overflowing with life energy?
25225,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I haven't seen one yet.
25226,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If you do, capture it alive and bring it back."
25227,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Fine.
25228,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.
25229,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down."
25230,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll take that as a promise.
25231,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?
25232,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Let's find a rare one and eat it.
25233,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Let's eat!
25234,The x Fight x Begins.,81,How's Rammot doing?
25235,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Tonight will be critical.
25236,The x Fight x Begins.,81,But his anger and stamina \Nshould see him through it.
25237,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Still, our army seems to have \Ntoo much personality."
25238,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"Having multiple perspectives helps, but too many are self-centered."
25239,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"We're meeting our quota, so there's \Nnothing to worry about."
25240,The x Fight x Begins.,81,You're one to talk.
25241,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Are you counting the humans you capture?
25242,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Hmm... Kind of.
25243,The x Fight x Begins.,81,That doesn't count.
25244,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Perhaps we should have everyone \Nassemble to discuss this.
25245,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"No, we operate at different times now."
25246,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Assembling everyone is impossible.
25247,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.
25248,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What about the Queen?
25249,The x Fight x Begins.,81,She's busy nourishing the King.
25250,The x Fight x Begins.,81,We can't distract her.
25251,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I'll handle this.
25252,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Sounds tough. \NDon't ruin your health.
25253,The x Fight x Begins.,81,"If you're honestly concerned, \Ntry to control yourself."
25254,The x Fight x Begins.,81,This is ugly...
25255,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.
25256,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Look at this.
25257,The x Fight x Begins.,81,So this is the hidden side of NGL.
25258,The x Fight x Begins.,81,I suppose so.
25259,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Killua... Kite...
25260,The x Fight x Begins.,81,The silence of the drug factory \Novertaken by the Chimera Ants further intensifies the chill in the air.
25261,The x Fight x Begins.,81,What awaits Gon and his friends there?
25262,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Next time: Kite x And x Slots.
25263,The x Fight x Begins.,81,Start the slots!
25264,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You didn't know?
25265,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I'm saying that some unique humans \Nare overflowing with life energy.
25266,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"They're hard to find, which is why they're rare."
25267,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rare?
25268,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What trick is this?
25269,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Suddenly, they feel far stronger."
25270,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Thunderbolt!
25271,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Thunderbolt
25272,Kite x And x Slots.,82,First comes rock...
25273,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rock...
25274,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Paper...
25275,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rock!
25276,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If you wish to become stronger, this is a perfect opportunity."
25277,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"But if you aren't prepared, you won't \Nbe able to endure the ordeal."
25278,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Whether we win or lose, hell lies ahead of us."
25279,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Kite x And x Slots
25280,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced deep within NGL, in search \Nof the Chimera Ant nest, and have arrived at a cliff \Nwith peculiar openings."
25281,Kite x And x Slots.,82,This is the Chimera Ant nest?
25282,Kite x And x Slots.,82,No.
25283,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They don't make their nests in holes.
25284,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They use mud and feces to build them.
25285,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Let's go.
25286,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You'll understand once we're inside.
25287,Kite x And x Slots.,82,There's no telling when or \Nfrom where they will attack.
25288,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Be on your guard.
25289,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Yeah, got it."
25290,Kite x And x Slots.,82,That other Chimera Ant completely concealed his presence.
25291,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Yeah.
25292,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Let's go.
25293,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Is this place...
25294,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Yes, it is NGL's hidden side."
25295,Kite x And x Slots.,82,A drug factory.
25296,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Exactly.
25297,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"This factory produces the ingestible drug D², which is spreading throughout the mainland."
25298,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"There are probably nearby bila trees, \Nwhich produce its main ingredient."
25299,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Ironic given their claims as preservationists.
25300,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They're making more than drugs.
25301,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Look.
25302,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It's the same as the others.
25303,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I assume that only the NGL leaders \Nknow the truth of this place.
25304,Kite x And x Slots.,82,The other members joined because they honestly loved nature.
25305,Kite x And x Slots.,82,So this facility is the center \Nof NGL's underground.
25306,Kite x And x Slots.,82,If it's empty...
25307,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Then Chimera Ants have wiped \Nout the NGL underground.
25308,Kite x And x Slots.,82,And a bunch of amateurs with guns \Nwon't suffice to deal with them.
25309,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What about their boss?
25310,Kite x And x Slots.,82,He either escaped or was eaten.
25311,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Either way, it's bad news."
25312,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Huh? What do you mean?
25313,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Shh!
25314,Kite x And x Slots.,82,A few are around.
25315,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They're slowly approaching \Nthrough the middle tunnel.
25316,Kite x And x Slots.,82,There are more in the left and right tunnels.
25317,Kite x And x Slots.,82,En...
25318,Kite x And x Slots.,82,How far away can you search?
25319,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Everything within a forty-five meter radius.
25320,Kite x And x Slots.,82,F-Forty-five meters?
25321,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Depending on physical and mental condition, \NI can increase that by a few meters."
25322,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Here they come.
25323,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Keep it down, you two."
25324,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Who are you guys?
25325,Kite x And x Slots.,82,How dare you intrude on my turf?
25326,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Help... Please help us!
25327,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Stop talking, Spot!"
25328,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You're just a damned dog!
25329,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oops, didn't mean to do that."
25330,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oh, well."
25331,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I'm getting bored with these guys.
25332,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too."
25333,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"When you beg like that, \NI just want to kill you more."
25334,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Stop!
25335,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Kite...
25336,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Don't move carelessly.
25337,Kite x And x Slots.,82,There's more than one enemy.
25338,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They want you to rush over.
25339,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Bye-bye.
25340,Kite x And x Slots.,82,H-Hel—
25341,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Don't look away.
25342,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If they shoot a projectile your way, \Nyou won't be able to see it."
25343,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I've got it.
25344,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You three will be my new dogs.
25345,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Chimera Ants have always been aggressive, but it seems consuming malicious humans \Nhas made them even more evil."
25346,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Huh? What do you mean?
25347,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Phagogenesis.
25348,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If we don't deal with them here, \Nmany more will die!"
25349,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Capture them!
25350,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I'll take the one in back.
25351,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You boys will have to deal \Nwith the two rushing us.
25352,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Right!
25353,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Got it.
25354,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Do not hesitate.
25355,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You must fight to kill.
25356,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Bring it!
25357,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Ha, take this."
25358,Kite x And x Slots.,82,My unblockable Thousand Punches!
25359,Kite x And x Slots.,82,That was close.
25360,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You have more power than I expected.
25361,Kite x And x Slots.,82,These guys are really tough.
25362,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"They have the hard shells of insects, \Ncombined with human agility..."
25363,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What's on your mind now?
25364,Kite x And x Slots.,82,He's right.
25365,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I can't hesitate!
25366,Kite x And x Slots.,82,First comes rock...
25367,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What?
25368,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Little boy, do you want your new \Nname to be Spot or Rover?"
25369,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Don't hesitate to kill.
25370,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"You'll be roving around the land of the \Ndead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!"
25371,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
25372,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Snake Awakens
25373,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Damn you!
25374,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Curse you!
25375,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Take this!
25376,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Fool!
25377,Kite x And x Slots.,82,This is the poisonous one!
25378,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Well?
25379,Kite x And x Slots.,82,How does it feel as the poison \Nspreads through your body?
25380,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Does it feel good?
25381,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Very effective.
25382,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Once I drug him enough, \Nwe'll have a human dog."
25383,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Are you done over there?
25384,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oh, not yet?"
25385,Kite x And x Slots.,82,How...
25386,Kite x And x Slots.,82,My body is immune to poison.
25387,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Ah, I see."
25388,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If you behave, I'll kill you fast."
25389,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oh, well..."
25390,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It just means that I was weaker.
25391,Kite x And x Slots.,82,She let that cheap act fool her.
25392,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What is this power flowing from his body?
25393,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage."
25394,Kite x And x Slots.,82,But...
25395,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What's wrong?
25396,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Are you getting scared?
25397,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!"
25398,Kite x And x Slots.,82,The source of his power is his fist!
25399,Kite x And x Slots.,82,He's preparing to launch an attack many...
25400,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"No, dozens of times stronger than the last."
25401,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?
25402,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"No, he's definitely going to use his fist."
25403,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Then I have no choice.
25404,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"I'll sacrifice my eight left \Nlegs to block his punch, while using the right eight to grab him."
25405,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Then I can bite him and inject my venom!
25406,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Let's run a simulation...
25407,Kite x And x Slots.,82,This will work!
25408,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It's just a punch.
25409,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"No matter how strong it is, if I'm prepared, I can take it!"
25410,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Hey, we should get started soon."
25411,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Wait a little longer.
25412,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Screw that!
25413,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You don't have a choice in the matter.
25414,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Now, entertain me."
25415,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Very well...
25416,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What...
25417,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Why are you here?
25418,Kite x And x Slots.,82,This is my castle.
25419,Kite x And x Slots.,82,A king needs no reason to be in his castle.
25420,Kite x And x Slots.,82,There are many drugs here \Nthat emit strong odors.
25421,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I would expect you to avoid this place.
25422,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Shut up... I like this place!
25423,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What happened to the head of NGL?
25424,Kite x And x Slots.,82,He would have been here.
25425,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Beats me!
25426,Kite x And x Slots.,82,He's probably inside the Queen's belly.
25427,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.
25428,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Then I'll take control of the whole world.
25429,Kite x And x Slots.,82,That will be impossible for a \Nboor who amuses himself by making dogs of humans.
25430,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Really now?
25431,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I can't wait to strip you down and \Nput a collar around your neck!
25432,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Damn!
25433,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Huh?
25434,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Hey! Get down here!
25435,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You only summon me when you're in trouble.
25436,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You'd better watch it.
25437,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I don't have time for small talk.
25438,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Hurry it up.
25439,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oh, really?"
25440,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You're so impatient.
25441,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Are you insulting me?
25442,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Forget about turning you into a dog!
25443,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I'm gonna kill you!
25444,Kite x And x Slots.,82,4!
25445,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Four, huh?"
25446,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Damn, bad spin."
25447,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What was that?
25448,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"I have no bad spins, bastard!"
25449,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Die!
25450,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"I'll pretend to attack, while I block his punch."
25451,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Then I grab him and bite.
25452,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Here I go!
25453,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rock... Paper...
25454,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Just as I thought!
25455,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Block!
25456,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Scissors!
25457,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What?
25458,Kite x And x Slots.,82,A-A sword?
25459,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Impossible...
25460,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Where was he hiding that?
25461,Kite x And x Slots.,82,But this could be perfect.
25462,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"I can pretend I've been defeated, then wait for an opening to bite him!"
25463,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You can't relax after dismembering them.
25464,Kite x And x Slots.,82,The head and body can survive an entire day after they've been separated.
25465,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You must crush the head.
25466,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"And preferably, you'll kill \Nthem quickly and quietly."
25467,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Oh, it's him!"
25468,Kite x And x Slots.,82,The thing that shot us.
25469,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I got a slot machine in my mouth!
25470,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It goes from 1 to 9.
25471,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Each number summons a different weapon.
25472,Kite x And x Slots.,82,This is my Crazy Slot!
25473,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Don't forget the name!
25474,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Just go away.
25475,Kite x And x Slots.,82,That's a strange power...
25476,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It talks by itself?
25477,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Apparently.
25478,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"If it uses a slot machine, doesn't that mean you can't \Nchoose your weapon?"
25479,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Yes, and I cannot change or get rid of the \Nweapon I receive until I use it."
25480,Kite x And x Slots.,82,It's very aggravating.
25481,Kite x And x Slots.,82,In that case...
25482,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Why did you come up with this power?
25483,Kite x And x Slots.,82,We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.
25484,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Were they killed?
25485,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"The signal indicated three enemies, and that they looked tastier than the others."
25486,Kite x And x Slots.,82,They must be rare humans.
25487,Kite x And x Slots.,82,And we have cause to fight.
25488,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?
25489,Kite x And x Slots.,82,So the rare humans should \Nstill be near the factory.
25490,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Let's go! Tonight, we feast!"
25491,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Feast!
25492,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Both of your powers are much \Neasier to use than mine.
25493,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.
25494,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Yeah.
25495,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Gon, you appear to have incorporated \NEnhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors."
25496,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Yep, but my natural affinity \Nlies with Enhancer abilities."
25497,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Killua used lightning. \NAre you a Transmuter?
25498,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Yeah, but it's not that strong, \Nand I lose energy fast."
25499,Kite x And x Slots.,82,You'll have the chance to improve.
25500,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Let's hurry.
25501,Kite x And x Slots.,82,The nest is close.
25502,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I don't get it...
25503,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I can feel power rushing into me.
25504,Kite x And x Slots.,82,My body is overflowing with energy!
25505,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What is this?!
25506,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What's wrong?
25507,Kite x And x Slots.,82,A signal from one of my soldiers.
25508,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rammot is acting strangely.
25509,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Rammot?
25510,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Well?
25511,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Look at this!
25512,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I feel reborn!
25513,Kite x And x Slots.,82,"Can you see that light, Peggy?"
25514,Kite x And x Slots.,82,What tremendous life energy...
25515,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Nen{\i0
25516,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Next time: Inspiration x To x Evolve.
25517,Kite x And x Slots.,82,I want inspiration to evolve!
25518,Kite x And x Slots.,82,When will you evolve?
25519,Kite x And x Slots.,82,Now!
25520,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
25521,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Scissors!
25522,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Well?
25523,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Look at this!
25524,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I feel reborn!
25525,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Inspiration x To x Evolve
25526,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"The Hunters Association has learned of the Chimera Ants \Nfrom the biological survey team, and now awaits the world leaders' \Ndecision on how to handle them."
25527,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We're counting on you.
25528,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,You have a single mission.
25529,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The immediate extermination \Nof these dangerous creatures.
25530,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There have already been many casualties.
25531,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We will use any means necessary.
25532,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Will that be acceptable?
25533,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Naturally, we have no intention of \Ntelling the experts how to proceed."
25534,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We simply desire those dangerous creatures \Neradicated as swiftly as possible.
25535,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Understood.
25536,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"So their goal is to eradicate the Ants, \Nleaving the Hunters Association to take the blame."
25537,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Th-The Chimera Ants have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top."
25538,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Queen
25539,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There's the Queen.
25540,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Royal Guard
25541,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Under her is the Royal Guard,"
25542,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Squadron Leaders and then, the Squadron Leaders."
25543,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains, and they oversee many foot \Nsoldiers and other grunts."
25544,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"A-And once the King is born, \Nthe hierarchy shifts like so."
25545,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The Royal Guard that followed the Queen switches into the King's service.
25546,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders \Nreport directly to the Queen, and she focuses on directing the soldiers."
25547,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"The Queen remains in the castle, \Nperiodically giving birth to Kings."
25548,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"The Kings travel and mate \Nwith different organisms, so as to breed new Queens."
25549,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That explains their fast reproduction rate.
25550,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion, you must defeat the Queen before \Nshe can give birth to a King."
25551,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"But first, you need to defeat \Nall the soldiers guarding her."
25552,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That's a tall order.
25553,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Got it. We'll be waiting.
25554,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The punitive force's first wave is on its way.
25555,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Punitive force?
25556,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I wonder who they'll send.
25557,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.
25558,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They'll be strong.
25559,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They'd better be!
25560,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm worried about Kite and the kids.
25561,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They'll arrive in three days.
25562,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,How?
25563,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Look at this!
25564,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Isn't it incredible?
25565,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Why does Rammot have so much life energy?
25566,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There must have been some catalyst.
25567,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,A catalyst...
25568,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Rock...
25569,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Paper...
25570,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Rock!
25571,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That hurts...
25572,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Damn...
25573,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What if their attacks were the catalyst?
25574,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I can feel the power filling me!
25575,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Peggy...
25576,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I told you that we are capable \Nof anything that humans are.
25577,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Including the use of this strange power?
25578,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,But this is...
25579,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Rammot, while you have that power, hit me."
25580,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Wh-What are you saying?
25581,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"You've been ticking me off, \Nso I won't go easy on you."
25582,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm assuming that's what it takes.
25583,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Then I won't hold back.
25584,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Come.
25585,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Colt!
25586,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This is a message from Hagya.
25587,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This is a message from Hagya.
25588,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The ultimate prey is either \Nwithin the factory or nearby.
25589,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Capture it.
25590,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Capture it...
25591,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Dead or alive.
25592,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Capture it!
25593,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Hagya-sama...
25594,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What is it?
25595,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Do you believe they will succeed?
25596,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There are enough Captains for a decent fight.
25597,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"For a decent fight, huh?"
25598,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,But I doubt they'll be much help.
25599,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm fine with that.
25600,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Why is that?
25601,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They're just buying time for us to arrive.
25602,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Oh, I see."
25603,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Then the rare humans will be ours to take.
25604,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Exactly.
25605,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We're surrounded.
25606,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Their numbers are great.
25607,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Now, then..."
25608,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Let's decide order and methodology.
25609,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"As for our targets, you have three choices."
25610,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,One...
25611,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Decide the order in which you will fight.
25612,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Two, attempt to escape."
25613,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Three, give up and let us capture you."
25614,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If you choose option one, you will fight one-on-one battles with us for a chance to survive."
25615,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I don't recommend the second option.
25616,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture and prolonged suffering for all of you."
25617,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Option three is out of the question.
25618,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That would anger us even more than option two.
25619,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"So, what will you do?"
25620,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Kite...
25621,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We couldn't have asked for a better deal.
25622,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,One-on-one fights with their Captains.
25623,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.
25624,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'll go.
25625,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"No, I will."
25626,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,First comes rock!
25627,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Rock, paper, scissors!"
25628,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Okay, I'm first!"
25629,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"While the Ants have inherited \Nindividualism from humans, they've lost the unity that's \Ncharacteristic of ants."
25630,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I hope we'll be able to take advantage of that change.
25631,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Well, we need to decide who \Nto send from our side."
25632,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,#6...
25633,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,#6!
25634,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Who's #6?
25635,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Lucky me!
25636,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Baro?
25637,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,How will the victor be decided?
25638,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Eh? That should be obvious.
25639,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Whoever dies first loses.
25640,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We can't just surrender?
25641,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What?!
25642,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Are you crazy?
25643,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen."
25644,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If you don't defeat me, \Nyou're guaranteed to die!"
25645,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Yeah, I'm okay with that."
25646,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,But there's no need for you to die.
25647,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If I beat you, I won't want to eat you."
25648,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If you surrender, you'll live."
25649,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"But if you lose, you must promise never to eat another human."
25650,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This guy isn't taking us seriously!
25651,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,He has more pep than any human I've seen!
25652,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Lucky you, Baro-chan!"
25653,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'll kill you!
25654,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,You managed to dodge that one.
25655,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Then how about this?
25656,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The same attack?
25657,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Gon!
25658,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,He altered course.
25659,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm fine.
25660,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Why are you so tough?
25661,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"By this point, the rest were vomiting organs."
25662,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Whatever...
25663,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Just need a few more times.
25664,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There's no way to dodge my homing roll!
25665,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Indeed...
25666,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,He only has to alter his course to \Nmatch the direction Gon dodges.
25667,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"What will you do, Gon?"
25668,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Kid, I have something to \Ntell you before I kill you."
25669,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them or to feed them to the Queen.
25670,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Then why?
25671,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Because it's fun!
25672,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I love the sound as humans \Nvomit their own organs with a plop!
25673,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,It's hilarious because it looks like barf.
25674,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That isn't funny.
25675,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"I'll make you vomit your own \Norgans with a plop, too!"
25676,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,He didn't dodge...
25677,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,But stopped him.
25678,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Compared to Razor's spikes, this is nothing!"
25679,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Well, we're in a hurry."
25680,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Who's my opponent?
25681,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Hey!
25682,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,#3.
25683,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,#3's up!
25684,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,You won't be smiling for long.
25685,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm about to show you hell.
25686,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Got it?
25687,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm nothing like the trash over there.
25688,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Trash?
25689,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Huh? I said trash because he's trash.
25690,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm ten times stronger than that guy.
25691,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Oh, that's nothing to brag about."
25692,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What was that?!
25693,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"When they enter battle, \Ntheir aura becomes much stronger."
25694,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,They're at their best in battle.
25695,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start, but we should have time."
25696,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We'll reach the Queen before \Nshe gives birth to the King.
25697,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,But why do I have such a bad feeling?
25698,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I feel like I'm missing something.
25699,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
25700,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Look, Peggy!"
25701,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I can freely control this energy!
25702,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This is incredible!
25703,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,We should do more research.
25704,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Eh?
25705,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If we learn the proper way \Nto wield this power, we can synchronize it with our natural abilities to make it an even stronger weapon."
25706,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,You're too retentive...
25707,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Zazan...
25708,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,She said she captured a rare \Nhuman a few days ago...
25709,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If we're lucky, he's still in the storeroom."
25710,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Find and secure him.
25711,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,My entire body is covered by hardened skin.
25712,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I can take as many of those \Nattacks as you can throw!
25713,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Oh, yeah?"
25714,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Is there anyone ten times \Nstronger than this guy?
25715,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This is a pleasant surprise.
25716,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.
25717,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Am I worried over nothing?
25718,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That's enough... It's my turn!
25719,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,2!
25720,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What?
25721,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Two, huh?"
25722,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Damn, bad spin."
25723,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Killua...
25724,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That scythe is nasty.
25725,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Gon, Killua..."
25726,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"In three seconds, jump up."
25727,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?
25728,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Right!
25729,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I've experienced this sensation before!
25730,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance
25731,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I remember now.
25732,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This is death!
25733,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Murder via overwhelming force.
25734,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Get lost.
25735,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,This scythe can be used \Nonly with this technique.
25736,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,And it won't disappear until I've used it.
25737,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,It's such a drag...
25738,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,So why did you choose that power?
25739,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Be cautious as we advance.
25740,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"As I mentioned, that won't be \Nenough to kill them immediately."
25741,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Are you okay?
25742,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,It's only getting worse from here.
25743,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"If you start to sympathize with the enemy, \Nyou won't be able to handle what's coming."
25744,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'm fine.
25745,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I have no sympathy for bugs \Nthat call each other trash.
25746,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,That's a dangerous view.
25747,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,What would you do if one of those \Nbugs cared for its comrades?
25748,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward \Nthe Chimera Ant Queen's castle to prevent the King's birth."
25749,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.
25750,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,I'll go.
25751,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"No, I will!"
25752,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,"No, me!"
25753,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Then I'll go.
25754,Inspiration x To x Evolve.,83,Go right ahead.
25755,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I have a bad feeling.
25756,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I feel like I'm missing something.
25757,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
25758,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,A x Fated x Awakening
25759,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Kite, Gon, and Killua have \Ntaken care of Hagya's soldiers."
25760,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"As they head deeper into NGL in \Nsearch of the Chimera Ants' nest, within the Queen's castle, one of the soon-to-be-born \NKing's three Royal Guards is about to awaken."
25761,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What kind of magic did they use?
25762,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half."
25763,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Impressive.
25764,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"This one almost looks like he was smashed \Nby a rock, or some other hard object."
25765,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,And Baro's the one with an iron shell.
25766,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,So this is the rare humans' power.
25767,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Are you worried now?
25768,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The king of the jungle's blood \Nruns through my veins.
25769,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,A few humans can't scare me.
25770,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Of course...
25771,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Whew, that's a relief."
25772,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I thought I was gonna miss out on tonight's feast.
25773,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,These must be extremely rare humans.
25774,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,We'll tear them to shreds and gobble them down!
25775,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,We're being followed.
25776,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Not from there.
25777,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,There's quite a number of them.
25778,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Listen up...
25779,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Your job is to distract the enemy, \Nwhile attacking from a distance."
25780,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Do not get too close.
25781,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"The 2nd Platoon will take the right, as the 3rd Platoon pincers \Nthem from the left."
25782,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"My 1st Platoon will trap them, \Npreventing a rear retreat."
25783,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Go!
25784,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Gon and I didn't notice them.
25785,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,They're coming from the left and the right.
25786,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Keep up your guard.
25787,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Damn...
25788,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The trees are getting in the way.
25789,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Yeah.
25790,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Shouldn't we get out of the forest?
25791,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This is a trap.
25792,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Okay, keep up the chase."
25793,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Hagya-sama, all goes according to plan."
25794,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Good work, Flutter."
25795,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Once we drive our prey into range, one strike with my fangs will finish them."
25796,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This doesn't feel right...
25797,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Eh?
25798,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"You ordered Flutter to chase the prey, while you hid in the grass to ambush them."
25799,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,That's pretty lame.
25800,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Huh?
25801,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Aren't you the king of the jungle?
25802,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"A king should face his prey, rather than hiding."
25803,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Just jump out and go, \N""Roar! Chomp! Ga ha ha ha!"""
25804,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,That's so much cooler.
25805,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But you know...
25806,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This is how the king of the jungle hunts.
25807,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Shut up and watch!
25808,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Yeah, yeah."
25809,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Well, I don't care, so long as I \Nget to eat the rare humans."
25810,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Rare human?
25811,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What's that?
25812,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'll explain the details later.
25813,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Its number is 4-933.
25814,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It was captured and brought \Nin by Zazan's squadron.
25815,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Number 4-933...
25816,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Doesn't mean a thing to me.
25817,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It was probably given to the Queen.
25818,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.
25819,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,She'll give birth to an incredible king.
25820,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Don't see 'em.
25821,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It must already be inside the Queen's belly.
25822,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Are you certain?
25823,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It isn't here...
25824,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Where else would it be?
25825,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Could it have escaped?
25826,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin will be paralyzed for at least a month.
25827,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"After a mere three days, it couldn't move around."
25828,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,You can't be sure when it \Nconcerns the rare ones.
25829,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,They aren't like normal humans.
25830,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,You should know that very well.
25831,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'm not the same creature I was before.
25832,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"The next time I see them,"
25833,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"I'll crush them, rip them apart, and eat them."
25834,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The antidote I hid in my \Nback tooth came in handy.
25835,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But I could barely drag myself across the ground.
25836,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"For the time being, I'll have to hide here..."
25837,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But what's going on?
25838,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,How can a Chimera Ant use{\i0
25839,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Could you check once more?
25840,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Come on, give me a break..."
25841,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'm busy enough as it is.
25842,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Didn't you hear me say the Queen \Nhas a huge appetite now?
25843,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I am well aware of that.
25844,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"I don't know anything about this ""rare"" stuff, but why are you so obsessed with this human?"
25845,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'd like to ask it a few questions.
25846,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Can't you see the light surrounding his body?
25847,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Light?
25848,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"No, I don't see a thing."
25849,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I see.
25850,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Then it's true that only some \Ncan identify this power.
25851,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Meaning it's a talent.
25852,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Exactly.
25853,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"This talent is my destiny, bestowed \Nupon me by the heavens."
25854,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The power of a chosen few...
25855,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"If I master this power, I can become the king!"
25856,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I will be king!
25857,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Retreat! Retreat!
25858,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?"
25859,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Wh-What's that?
25860,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,He's gorgeous!
25861,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,We're leaving.
25862,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Huh?
25863,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What about the feast?
25864,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"He was able to understand \Nthat he was outclassed, and he calmly backed down at once."
25865,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader."
25866,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I always believed that the world revolved around my claws and fangs.
25867,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"That if I brandished them,"
25868,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"I could take the life of any other creature, could always satisfy my own hunger..."
25869,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,And that I was truly blessed.
25870,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"However, that wasn't the case."
25871,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Others were stronger, \Nso I never could have ruled."
25872,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Death taught me that lesson.
25873,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But I am stronger now.
25874,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"At the moment, we may not be \Nstrong enough to defeat them."
25875,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But now we are armed with the ability to learn.
25876,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,We're following them.
25877,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Their nest must be nearby.
25878,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"If we follow them, we will find the Queen."
25879,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What is that?
25880,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Something is coming!
25881,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,That was a fascinating conversation...
25882,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,You mentioned something about talent.
25883,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Allow me to take part.
25884,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!
25885,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"If I master this power, I can become the king!"
25886,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I will be the king!
25887,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,A short and foolish dream...
25888,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I am totally outclassed.
25889,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I can never escape the position \NI've been born into...
25890,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,You can relax.
25891,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Let's talk over there.
25892,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Y-Yes!
25893,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This power is not for me...
25894,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,But for this Royal Guard...
25895,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,And for the King it serves!
25896,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This power is for serving them!
25897,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Impossible...
25898,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What is that evil aura?
25899,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,By the way...
25900,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Yes?
25901,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Why is a live human underneath those bones?
25902,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nyow{\i0
25903,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,What are you researching?
25904,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'm learning about those rare \Nhumans you mentioned.
25905,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"I've attempted to study them many times, but it wasn't written in any books."
25906,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Asking one of them is faster \Nthan flipping through books.
25907,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Wasn't that why you were looking for him?
25908,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Th-That's exactly right.
25909,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,There we go.
25910,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Ah!
25911,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"""New memories are stored \Nin the hippocampus, while old memories are kept \Nin the cerebral cortex."
25912,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"To invoke those memories..."""
25913,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nyow{\i0
25914,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Ah, you... Come over here."
25915,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Hatsu{\i0
25916,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0
25917,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,They are:
25918,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Enhancers,"
25919,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Transmuters,"
25920,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Conjurers,"
25921,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Emitters,"
25922,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Manipulators, and Specialists, for a total of six categories."
25923,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,C-Categories...
25924,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0
25925,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"You want to increase the amount of your aura, as well as the speed of its flow."
25926,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Most of your basic training will \Nbe spent on these two tasks.
25927,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0 those are the factors that...
25928,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,That...
25929,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Th-that are pivotal in determining the victor.
25930,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nyow{\i0
25931,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0 there are also unique techniques that reflect
25932,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0
25933,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0 the manifestation of your ability has \Na better chance of being stronger.
25934,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0
25935,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Water divination is the simplest and most commonly used method.
25936,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Water divination?
25937,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Give it a try, Rammot."
25938,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Right.
25939,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Since the water's overflowing, that makes you an Enhancer."
25940,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,An Enhancer?
25941,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0
25942,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Seems so.
25943,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Oh, yeah..."
25944,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Didn't you say you fought a rare human?
25945,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Y-Yes.
25946,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The impact from its attack opened your pores...
25947,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,And released your aura.
25948,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Pores?
25949,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Apparently, they're small holes all over your body."
25950,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"If they're sealed, aura can't be released."
25951,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I see...
25952,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Colt also thought that Rammot's change was triggered by his fight \Nwith the rare humans.
25953,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It seems he was correct.
25954,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Nen{\i0 can we use him to open everyone's pores?
25955,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Sure, sounds good."
25956,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I think I'll give this a try.
25957,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,The leaf wilted...
25958,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Unbelievable.
25959,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,One of us was born possessing {\i0 without having to fight a rare human!
25960,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist, not belonging to another category?"
25961,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Neferpitou.
25962,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Huh?
25963,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,That is the name the Queen gave me.
25964,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"From now on, call me Neferpitou."
25965,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Right!
25966,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I don't need him anymore.
25967,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Feed him to the Queen now.
25968,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Right!
25969,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"From birth, Neferpitou already \Npossessed incredible power."
25970,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,This presence casts a dark shadow over the fates of Gon and his friends.
25971,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Next time: Light x And x Darkness.
25972,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,Wake up!
25973,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,"C'mon, it's morning."
25974,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,It's 10:50.
25975,A x Fated x Awakening.,84,I'll kill-you-a!
25976,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Neferpitou.
25977,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh?
25978,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That is the name the Queen gave me.
25979,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"From now on, call me Neferpitou."
25980,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Light x And x Darkness
25981,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains...
25982,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.
25983,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Commander Neferpitou will hold an award ceremony in auditorium one.
25984,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If you are able to endure considerable pain, you will receive tremendous power in return."
25985,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That power is to be used for our Queen!
25986,Light x And x Darkness.,85,They're continuing to go straight.
25987,Light x And x Darkness.,85,The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.
25988,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Amazing...
25989,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"He's been picking them up this entire time, \Nnever losing them for an instant."
25990,Light x And x Darkness.,85,En{\i0
25991,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
25992,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Kite is nearly there.
25993,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Actually, given that he's kept \Nit up for an entire night, he's probably stronger."
25994,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Stronger than a master...
25995,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Then Kite's the real deal.
25996,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met."
25997,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter, but we really only knew him \Nas another player in a game."
25998,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Bisky was an incredible Hunter.
25999,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But to us...
26000,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26001,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26002,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26003,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Looking back, we always meet the right people \Njust when we need them most."
26004,Light x And x Darkness.,85,And those people have all made us stronger.
26005,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Razor, too, huh?"
26006,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Yeah.
26007,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Greed Island {\i0
26008,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"And once you beat the game, \Nhe deliberately led you to Kite."
26009,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Ging!
26010,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I'm not sure if Ging predicted what \Nwould happen when we met Kite.
26011,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But he certainly knew that you would like the man who \Nhad earned Ging's respect.
26012,Light x And x Darkness.,85,And he knew without doubt \Nthat you would go with Kite.
26013,Light x And x Darkness.,85,He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.
26014,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"This is a pretty brutal place for training, though."
26015,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.
26016,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"As you mentioned,"
26017,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Ging-san probably had certain \Nexpectations when he sent you to me.
26018,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But I do not intend to train \Nyou during this journey.
26019,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We don't have that kind of time.
26020,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I brought you along because I \Nthought you might be of use.
26021,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"From here, it all comes down to your resolve."
26022,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26023,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If it's weak, the Ants will eat you."
26024,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But we can't die...
26025,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We are pro Hunters.
26026,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Those who call themselves \NHunters always get their prey.
26027,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"For Hunters, that is the first commandment."
26028,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Those who call themselves Hunters \Nshould always be on the hunt.
26029,Light x And x Darkness.,85,A hunt involves both hunter and prey.
26030,Light x And x Darkness.,85,It is a battle of resolve.
26031,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve \Nis what makes a successful hunt.
26032,Light x And x Darkness.,85,The loser has to follow the \Nwinner's rules and customs.
26033,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Usually, this means the loser's death."
26034,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Rules...
26035,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If you don't want that result, then win."
26036,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26037,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"But to be a successful Hunter, you must \Nunderstand your enemy and yourself."
26038,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Th-That's why...
26039,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's why you hit me back then!
26040,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Fool!
26041,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Why would you try to enter Snake \NBeech Forest in this season?!
26042,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Look!
26043,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's a territorial marker \Nmade by Foxbears with cubs.
26044,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!
26045,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That was the forest's rule and custom.
26046,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You taught me the rules in Ging's place.
26047,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Oh...
26048,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's right... I just remembered.
26049,Light x And x Darkness.,85,A Hunter License?
26050,Light x And x Darkness.,85,What's this?
26051,Light x And x Darkness.,85,This is Ging-san's.
26052,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh? It's Ging's?
26053,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Do you remember what my final test was?
26054,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Yeah, to find Ging."
26055,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me."
26056,Light x And x Darkness.,85,He said I should use it to find him...
26057,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I planned to return it to him once I did.
26058,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh? He wouldn't take it back?
26059,Light x And x Darkness.,85,No...
26060,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I completely forgot I had it.
26061,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Gon, you said that you're going to \Nfind Ging-san on your own, right?"
26062,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh?
26063,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Yeah.
26064,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Then you have to do it.
26065,Light x And x Darkness.,85,And would you return this for me?
26066,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Sure!
26067,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"But first, I have to finish this job \Nwith you and get a lot stronger."
26068,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"After that, I'll find Ging and give this back."
26069,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I promise!
26070,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I'm counting on you.
26071,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Well, let's get a move on before we lose the trail."
26072,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Take that!
26073,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Next!
26074,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Being average is terrible...
26075,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You have to go to all this trouble \Njust to unleash your power.
26076,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Peggy, I'll leave this to you."
26077,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Where are you going?
26078,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I want to find out how strong I really am.
26079,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's a monster.
26080,Light x And x Darkness.,85,What is this?
26081,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I don't believe it!
26082,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"What's wrong, Kite?"
26083,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Gon, Killua..."
26084,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Run!
26085,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh?
26086,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Hurry up!
26087,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Get out of here!
26088,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Found you...
26089,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Get away from me!
26090,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Malice
26091,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Idio—
26092,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Good decision, Killua."
26093,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Take Gon and run!
26094,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"This time, you're in big trouble..."
26095,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Let's see if you get a good roll!
26096,Light x And x Darkness.,85,3!
26097,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Ah, so you can do stuff like that?"
26098,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We were overconfident...
26099,Light x And x Darkness.,85,The two of us were still weaker \Nthan Kite who'd lost an arm.
26100,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That thing knew.
26101,Light x And x Darkness.,85,This is reality.
26102,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If Kite had been alone, this probably wouldn't have happened."
26103,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We were fools!
26104,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Hey...
26105,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Look.
26106,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Huh? You left Kite behind?
26107,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Why?!
26108,Light x And x Darkness.,85,What happened?
26109,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Explain what's going on!
26110,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"H-Hey, what are you doing?!"
26111,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Yes, I understand."
26112,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Can you wait there a little longer?
26113,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We're headed your way right now.
26114,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We have reinforcements.
26115,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Chairman Netero.
26116,Light x And x Darkness.,85,What's this? They're just kids.
26117,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If you're here to play, you'll get burned."
26118,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Go back home.
26119,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Stop it, Morel-san."
26120,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That isn't nice...
26121,Light x And x Darkness.,85,They're only children.
26122,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You look pretty defeated.
26123,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Was the enemy that strong?
26124,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26125,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.
26126,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Worse than my brother's...
26127,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Worse than Hisoka's...
26128,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26129,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You guys are unbelievably strong.
26130,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But I still can't see you defeating that thing...
26131,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Whenever humans encounter the unknown, they tend to lose perspective."
26132,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic."
26133,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed."
26134,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"You're no better than I am, Knov."
26135,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Kid...
26136,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26137,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"In most cases, you won't know \Nyour opponent's abilities."
26138,Light x And x Darkness.,85,One instant of carelessness is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.
26139,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You can't make assumptions based \Non the amount of aura displayed.
26140,Light x And x Darkness.,85,The battle can turn at any point.
26141,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26142,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"But regardless, you must always fight certain of victory."
26143,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Nen{\i0
26144,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"The moment you were overwhelmed by the opponent's aura and fled, \Nyou were disqualified."
26145,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You're lower than a loser!
26146,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Morel, that's enough."
26147,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Is Gon asleep?
26148,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"He was going to attack the enemy, so I used force to stop him."
26149,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"I didn't have time to control my strength, so I don't know when he'll wake up."
26150,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"That kid shows some promise, then."
26151,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Morel!
26152,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"It's difficult to believe that giant \NChimera Ants are eating humans, but since it appears to be true, we must keep casualties to a minimum."
26153,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"If we send fighters who aren't strong enough, \Nthey'll only strengthen the enemy."
26154,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Do you understand?
26155,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Yeah.
26156,Light x And x Darkness.,85,That's why there are only three.
26157,Light x And x Darkness.,85,A select few...
26158,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We're not strong enough.
26159,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
26160,Light x And x Darkness.,85,It's your decision whether you want to fight.
26161,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But you must defeat them before you come.
26162,Light x And x Darkness.,85,If you wish to live as a Hunter...
26163,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We are not desperate for help.
26164,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We only seek the strong.
26165,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Will you fight!? Or not!?
26166,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"The moment you were overwhelmed by the opponent's aura and fled, \Nyou were disqualified."
26167,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You're lower than a loser!
26168,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I am no longer qualified...
26169,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Killua...
26170,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Thanks.
26171,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Why would you thank me?
26172,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Weren't you the one who stopped me?
26173,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Had I lost control back there, \NI would've gotten in Kite's way."
26174,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Then, all three of us could have died."
26175,Light x And x Darkness.,85,But I...
26176,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I let Kite die...
26177,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Kite is alive!
26178,Light x And x Darkness.,85,He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
26179,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"But considering his injury, \Nhe'd have a hard time moving around."
26180,Light x And x Darkness.,85,So he's probably hiding.
26181,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Waiting for us to return!
26182,Light x And x Darkness.,85,So we should hurry back...
26183,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Once we're stronger.
26184,Light x And x Darkness.,85,To save Kite!
26185,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Gon...
26186,Light x And x Darkness.,85,You are light.
26187,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Yeah, you're right."
26188,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"Sometimes, you shine so \Nbrightly, I must look away."
26189,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"But even so, is it still okay \Nif I stay at your side?"
26190,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Let's go.
26191,Light x And x Darkness.,85,To become stronger!
26192,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We welcome you anytime!!
26193,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Prepare a freezer in the castle.
26194,Light x And x Darkness.,85,We need one that can store \Nover a hundred humans.
26195,Light x And x Darkness.,85,To ensure that our collection doesn't rot.
26196,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Yep.
26197,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I think
26198,Light x And x Darkness.,85,I'm pretty strong.
26199,Light x And x Darkness.,85,Next time: Promise x and x Reunion.
26200,Light x And x Darkness.,85,"It has to be Killua... chair, man{\i0"
26201,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Kite is alive!
26202,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
26203,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So we should hurry back...
26204,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Once we're stronger.
26205,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,To save Kite!
26206,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Promise x and x Reunion
26207,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.
26208,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"But before they can return to NGL, they must pass the condition \Nset by Chairman Netero, leader of the punitive force."
26209,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What are those?
26210,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Tokens.
26211,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"You take a piece of marked wood and split it, giving each half to a different person."
26212,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,They work as proof that you're an ally or to authenticate a document.
26213,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
26214,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"In this case, each of the two assassins \Nholds one matching token."
26215,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We defeat them and take the tokens.
26216,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,It's been erased.
26217,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That means someone checked the board.
26218,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Yeah.
26219,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You must be Killua and Gon.
26220,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Nice to meet you.
26221,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,My name is Palm.
26222,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,It's a pleasure.
26223,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Oh, dear..."
26224,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,No need to be so tense.
26225,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.
26226,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Allow me to explain.
26227,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Why don't we have some tea?
26228,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I am a student of Knov-sensei.
26229,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He said I would only get in his way...
26230,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But I insisted on accompanying him.
26231,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Who's that?
26232,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,She probably means one of the \Nguys with Chairman Netero.
26233,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Yes, the one wearing a black suit..."
26234,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,My teacher is an incredible person.
26235,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Cool, intelligent, composed..."
26236,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!"
26237,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Oh, dear..."
26238,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Oh, but I only respect him, that's all."
26239,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,There's nothing romantic about my feelings...
26240,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"At least, I may wish that were the case."
26241,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"After all, when it comes to falling \Nin love, respect is a major factor."
26242,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Ah, my teacher knows nothing \Nabout this, of course."
26243,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"I haven't said a word to him, \Nand I don't intend to."
26244,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,No one can say what will happen...
26245,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"After all, love is a spontaneous thing, don't you agree?"
26246,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Uh, can I interrupt you?"
26247,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Aren't we supposed to fight you?
26248,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Huh? Oh, dear..."
26249,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Yes, I apologize."
26250,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The Chairman and my teacher said I couldn't accompany them any farther.
26251,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But I insisted on going with them.
26252,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying \Nto convince them of my determination.
26253,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"And finally, they relented, with one condition."
26254,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Uh, I'm asking about..."
26255,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"My teacher may appear a cold person, but he's actually quite gentle."
26256,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But you have to spend a lot of \Ntime with him to realize that.
26257,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Ah, by ""spending time with him,"" I don't mean—"
26258,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Okay! What's the condition?!
26259,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.
26260,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats will be allowed inside NGL before me..."
26261,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I cannot allow that.
26262,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Hatsu{\i0
26263,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,She's an Enhancer like me.
26264,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'm not too happy about that.
26265,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Knuckle and Shoot?
26266,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Not us?
26267,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That's right.
26268,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"After all, I'm not the one who's \Nsupposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot."
26269,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You two are.
26270,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.
26271,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"They, too, received a condition."
26272,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I don't know what that condition was...
26273,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"But whether it's us or them, only one \Ngroup will be allowed into NGL."
26274,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The deadline is one month.
26275,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Since we were told to keep \Nthese tokens for a month, that means someone will come for them."
26276,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"What do we do, Knuckle?"
26277,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That's easy.
26278,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"He who strikes first, wins!"
26279,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Find 'em...
26280,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,And kill 'em!
26281,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Certain Death
26282,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,My name is Knuckle Bine!
26283,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I am a Beast Hunter!
26284,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I challenge the two punitive \Nforce candidates to a duel!
26285,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!"
26286,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Bring it on
26287,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I won't try to run or hide.
26288,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I won't bring any weapons or allies.
26289,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,It'll just be me and me alone.
26290,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So come and fight me!
26291,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But where?
26292,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The location?
26293,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You have to tell them where to find you.
26294,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Bring it on
26295,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,A man never turns his back on an enemy.
26296,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...
26297,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You won't get away!
26298,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Even if he said where, I wouldn't go."
26299,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He's just a decoy.
26300,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"His partner's probably hidden \Nsomewhere, watching."
26301,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,They're watching to see if \Nanyone reacts suspiciously.
26302,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"According to Palm, they don't \Neven know our names."
26303,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Yeah.
26304,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So their goal must be to smoke us out.
26305,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.
26306,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Did he look strong?
26307,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He's pretty strong.
26308,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What will it take to defeat him?
26309,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I have no idea!
26310,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that
26311,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Nen{\i0
26312,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"So, according to him, it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won."
26313,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I disagree.
26314,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If you want to survive, you must \Nincrease your odds of victory."
26315,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Gauging the strength differential between \Nyou and an opponent is crucial.
26316,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If you're up against someone you can only beat once or twice out of a \Nhundred times, don't bother."
26317,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You need at least a fifty-percent chance.
26318,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If possible, greater than \Nseventy percent is preferable."
26319,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"To reach that, we must do two things..."
26320,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Work on our fundamentals, and learn \Nmore about our opponents' abilities."
26321,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Right.
26322,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If we know our opponents' abilities, \Nit'll be easier to plan ahead."
26323,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Like we did against Genthru.
26324,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"I'm half agreed, and half opposed."
26325,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What do you mean?
26326,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"I think we should work on our fundamentals, but I don't think we need to know their abilities."
26327,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Huh? Why not?
26328,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That just increases our risk of defeat.
26329,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Nothing good can come of that!
26330,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.
26331,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...
26332,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"It's to become stronger, \Nand return to NGL and save Kite."
26333,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"In other words, we must be strong enough to defeat \Nenemies we know nothing about."
26334,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Winning here with advance \Npreparation is pointless.
26335,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"That's true, but we have to defeat these opponents first."
26336,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"After all, we only have a month."
26337,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That's too long.
26338,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,One week.
26339,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"In one week, we'll be stronger, \Nand heading back to NGL!"
26340,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Go—
26341,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Are you an idiot?!
26342,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Bisky!
26343,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Why are you here?
26344,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I asked her to come.
26345,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Huh? You know each other?
26346,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"No, I looked into your backgrounds."
26347,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,How?
26348,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We only know Bisky because...
26349,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Once I used my power, it was quite simple."
26350,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Now, there's no time to spare."
26351,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Let's begin...
26352,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.
26353,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Um, no."
26354,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Let's get started, then."
26355,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Osu!
26356,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What was that for?!
26357,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'm picking up where I left off.
26358,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Are you stupid?
26359,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That old man's famous for his nasty nature.
26360,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If he tells you to do something in a month, it probably should take an entire year."
26361,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You won't defeat them after a week!
26362,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But we have to hurry back and save Kite.
26363,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What are you talking about?
26364,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That was fun...
26365,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Like a dream come true.
26366,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'd love to fight you... once more.
26367,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I see...
26368,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,All the more reason you shouldn't \Nreturn without proper training!
26369,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What if you make the same mistake again?!
26370,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So typical of her age.
26371,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,She's always ready with a lecture.
26372,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Got it?
26373,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Osu...
26374,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Let's start training, then."
26375,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Ren{\i0
26376,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Maintain that for three hours.
26377,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Killua, how long can you last?"
26378,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"In top condition, I can manage \Naround fifty-five minutes, max."
26379,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Until you complete this, \Nwe can't move to the next step."
26380,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Train like your lives are on the line!
26381,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Come on.
26382,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You didn't even last an hour.
26383,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Okay, keep working."
26384,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Ren{\i0
26385,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You won't have time to sleep.
26386,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Curses...
26387,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Those damn cowards ran away!
26388,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You bastards deserve to die now!
26389,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You have a collar.
26390,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Where's your owner?
26391,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You're supposed to keep the park clean.
26392,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Okay, you can rest for today!"
26393,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.
26394,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Looks like it's time for me to use my power.
26395,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Take it away, Cookie-chan."
26396,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.
26397,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Pink Relief
26398,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Excuse me...
26399,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"I hope this won't offend you, but I'll let you decide how to train them."
26400,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Since my power told me that \Nyou would be the answer.
26401,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"However, if they cannot defeat Morel's \Ndisciples after one month,"
26402,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.
26403,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I absolutely must go to NGL.
26404,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Honestly, I want to depart this moment."
26405,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"So after I've waited and waited \Nand waited and waited and waited, if this fails now,"
26406,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'll probably kill all of you...
26407,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Was that a threat?
26408,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"No, it's a warning."
26409,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'm worried about you all.
26410,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"So if you think they have no chance, \NI recommend that you leave..."
26411,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Speaking from experience, I'm less \Nlikely to lose my temper that way."
26412,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I'm not the one you should tell.
26413,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Once they're awake, tell the boys."
26414,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Don't worry! We've got this!
26415,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You can count on us to get you to NGL.
26416,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So let us know if you notice anything.
26417,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We'll do our best.
26418,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That's how they are.
26419,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Have some faith.
26420,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Oh, dear!"
26421,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,This won't do at all...
26422,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Anyway, I'm more concerned about \Nwhat's happening inside NGL."
26423,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,What is the Chairman's group \Ndoing for the next month?
26424,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Well?!
26425,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Ah, well..."
26426,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.
26427,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Identifying the enemy's strengths, \Nand weakening their forces..."
26428,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The experts can't agree on the amount of time remaining before the King's birth.
26429,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"The Chairman is operating with two months, the earliest prediction, as the deadline."
26430,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,This is bad.
26431,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That thing is stronger than I am.
26432,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Stronger than the Chairman?
26433,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Surely you jest.
26434,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If that's really true, none of the Hunters will be able to fight it."
26435,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Nen{\i0
26436,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Now, I'm more or less even with you guys."
26437,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Then you're more than strong enough.
26438,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You should have more confidence.
26439,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?
26440,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Growing old is no fun.
26441,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He never stops talking.
26442,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But we must fight.
26443,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I would prefer to avoid it...
26444,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If there were a solution that would \Navoid a fight, I'd choose it."
26445,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Our target is the Queen, \Nand the Queen alone."
26446,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,En{\i0
26447,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We cannot avoid a fight...
26448,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,The question is how we will manage to win.
26449,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If anyone has any brilliant ideas, \NI'd like to hear them."
26450,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You're simply awful.
26451,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"When you asked us to join, did you not \Nalready have an answer in mind?"
26452,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"We exterminate the Ants \Nin silence, one at a time."
26453,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Yeah, let's take it slow."
26454,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Might as well enjoy the job...
26455,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Okay...
26456,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"First, we should learn the enemy's numbers."
26457,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Go.
26458,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,So many.
26459,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Something is coming.
26460,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,They aren't alive...
26461,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Is this the enemy's power?
26462,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Now, what to do?"
26463,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You may as well wait.
26464,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"If they come here, we simply destroy them."
26465,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You have a point.
26466,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,These could be decoys.
26467,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Huh, what?"
26468,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Was I speaking aloud?
26469,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,No.
26470,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I simply knew what you were thinking.
26471,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Who are you, anyway?"
26472,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,One of the Queen's Royal Guard.
26473,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Shaiapouf.
26474,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.
26475,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.
26476,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Yes, that is correct."
26477,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,You can read all my thoughts.
26478,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Not sure I like that.
26479,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Well, I can understand the sentiment."
26480,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,But...
26481,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,He will wake soon.
26482,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,That's good news!
26483,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"You see, I haven't been able to \Ndecide what power to develop."
26484,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Right, it's so simple."
26485,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I merely need to fix him.
26486,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I only need the power to do that.
26487,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"And then, I will be able to experience \Nthat dreamlike moment with you once more..."
26488,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Come on, what are you doing?"
26489,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot, \Nmuch less the Chimera Ants, like this."
26490,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Are you giving up on going to NGL?
26491,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,N-No way...
26492,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,We never give up.
26493,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"We must return to NGL, no matter \Nwhat we have to do to get there!"
26494,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,To save Kite...
26495,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"After reuniting with Bisky,"
26496,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Gon and Killua are back to training.
26497,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,They have one goal: to get strong enough to save Kite.
26498,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Right now, that motivation is driving Gon."
26499,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,Next time: Duel x and x Escape.
26500,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"It's on, Killua!"
26501,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"It's on, Gon!"
26502,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,"Rock, paper... Rock!"
26503,Promise x and x Reunion.,86,I lost...
26504,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Right, it's so simple."
26505,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I merely need to fix him.
26506,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I only need the power to do that.
26507,Duel x and x Escape.,87,The question is how we will manage to win.
26508,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If anyone has any brilliant ideas, \NI'd like to hear them."
26509,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You're simply awful.
26510,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"When you asked us to join, did you not \Nalready have an answer in mind?"
26511,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"We exterminate the Ants \Nin silence, one at a time."
26512,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Come on, what are you doing?"
26513,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot, \Nmuch less the Chimera Ants, like this."
26514,Duel x and x Escape.,87,N-No way...
26515,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We never give up.
26516,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"We must return to NGL, no matter \Nwhat we have to do to get there!"
26517,Duel x and x Escape.,87,To save Kite...
26518,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Promise x And x Reunion
26519,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"As the Queen prepares for the King's birth, she requires the equivalent of two hundred \Nand fifty human meatballs per day to give birth to a strong King."
26520,Duel x and x Escape.,87,It moved.
26521,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Meanwhile, Gon and Killua continue their training so they \Ncan defeat Knuckle and Shoot, take their tokens, and return to NGL."
26522,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Will this really be enough for \Nthem to execute the plan to slaughter Morel's disciples?
26523,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Okay, all done!"
26524,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You finally lasted for three hours.
26525,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We did it...
26526,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That was hard!
26527,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I can't move an inch...
26528,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What are you talking about?
26529,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Stand up.
26530,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We're going out.
26531,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26532,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Where to?
26533,Duel x and x Escape.,87,To see Knuckle.
26534,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Wh-Why?
26535,Duel x and x Escape.,87,See? You can move.
26536,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Let's go!
26537,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.
26538,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Jeez, don't ask questions \Nwith obvious answers."
26539,Duel x and x Escape.,87,To fight him!
26540,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?!
26541,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Okay, let's go!"
26542,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What are you talking about?
26543,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We still have time.
26544,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What if we lose?
26545,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You just try again.
26546,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26547,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Whether you win or lose isn't important.
26548,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"All that matters is who ends \Nup with the tokens, right?"
26549,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Yeah.
26550,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Which means you must take theirs.
26551,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If it looks like you'll lose, run."
26552,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Then try again the next day.
26553,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Ren{\i0
26554,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"After that, you'll challenge Knuckle."
26555,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And you'll continue until you win.
26556,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Still a no show, huh?"
26557,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Your owner's really bad...
26558,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Hey, stop it!"
26559,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That tickles.
26560,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Cut it out!
26561,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Hey, come on..."
26562,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Is that Knuckle?
26563,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Yeah.
26564,Duel x and x Escape.,87,No way...
26565,Duel x and x Escape.,87,They're the other candidates?
26566,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Guess they must not respect me...
26567,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If I'm being compared to a couple of kids, they must not think I'm very strong..."
26568,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Eh?!
26569,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Such an intimidating presence...
26570,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"We should act first, but we can't move!"
26571,Duel x and x Escape.,87,A duel is a battle to the death.
26572,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Serious business!
26573,Duel x and x Escape.,87,It's best to fight five hours \Nafter a good night's sleep.
26574,Duel x and x Escape.,87,So what's with you kids? \NYou're completely worn out!
26575,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Were you just out swimming or something, eh?"
26576,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Take this seriously!
26577,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You kids can never defeat me.
26578,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Are you crying?
26579,Duel x and x Escape.,87,S-Stupid...
26580,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Wh-Why would I cry?
26581,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'm not upset about this.
26582,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Th-Th-These are just, well, uh..."
26583,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Tears from laughing too much, fool."
26584,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"I'll kill you, get it?"
26585,Duel x and x Escape.,87,So don't tell anyone!
26586,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Punch me!
26587,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26588,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll show you how much stronger I really am.
26589,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And you'll realize that I don't need \Nto bother dodging your punches.
26590,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Hit me as many times as you like.
26591,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"But if I don't take a step from this spot, leave your tokens behind."
26592,Duel x and x Escape.,87,This is the best chance you'll have!
26593,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You kids would need a hundred years \Nbefore you could try fighting me!
26594,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You're the one who challenged us to a duel.
26595,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Don't look down on us!
26596,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'd like to respond that way...
26597,Duel x and x Escape.,87,But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.
26598,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We have no right to argue that.
26599,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Not right now...
26600,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"The fact is, we can't overcome everything with willpower."
26601,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We can't argue with him...
26602,Duel x and x Escape.,87,But we don't have to accept it!
26603,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I won't stop hitting you until you move.
26604,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Enough talk...
26605,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Just get to it.
26606,Duel x and x Escape.,87,First comes rock!
26607,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Whoa, whoa, whoa..."
26608,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What's with the intense aura?
26609,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That's cheating!
26610,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll use{\i0
26611,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"No, I have to defend with {\i0"
26612,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Crap...
26613,Duel x and x Escape.,87,But where do I defend?
26614,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If I guess wrong,"
26615,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I could die...
26616,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Come on...
26617,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'd expect him to attack the belly.
26618,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Yeah, that's the only real choice."
26619,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Gotta be the belly.
26620,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Rock...
26621,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Yeah, it's the belly!"
26622,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Belly! Belly! Belly!
26623,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Paper...
26624,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Rock!
26625,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Knuckle-san?
26626,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You okay?
26627,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I... trusted... you...
26628,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What's with him?
26629,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Obviously, he's a total idiot."
26630,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Oh, are you awake?"
26631,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You're stronger than I thought.
26632,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Guess I underestimated you...
26633,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Why didn't you take this?
26634,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You should've taken the \Ntoken and ditched me.
26635,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We don't want your token.
26636,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We want the strength to defeat \Nyou in a straight-up fight.
26637,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Could I ask you something?
26638,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Sure, go ahead."
26639,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Why did you become a Beast Hunter?
26640,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26641,Duel x and x Escape.,87,It's a long story...
26642,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And it brings back bad memories.
26643,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?"
26644,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Simply put, to keep it from doing its job."
26645,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I don't like the idea of cutting off \Nwhatever doesn't fit the mold.
26646,Duel x and x Escape.,87,My teacher says I'm just a softy.
26647,Duel x and x Escape.,87,But you can't judge something that \Nyou've never seen before...
26648,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"First, you have to exchange blows."
26649,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And you'll get yourself killed in the process!
26650,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You're a good kid.
26651,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Now that we've fought, I see that."
26652,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"You, too."
26653,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26654,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You!
26655,Duel x and x Escape.,87,He wouldn't leave your side.
26656,Duel x and x Escape.,87,They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
26657,Duel x and x Escape.,87,S-Stupid!
26658,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'm not crying...
26659,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Don't tell anyone!
26660,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Or I'll kill you...
26661,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Morel's student...
26662,Duel x and x Escape.,87,It's good!
26663,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Fight me any time you want.
26664,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Huh?
26665,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll give you as many tries as you want.
26666,Duel x and x Escape.,87,But it's impossible for you to beat me in the twenty days left.
26667,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Good stuff.
26668,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What is this smoke?
26669,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Where am I?
26670,Duel x and x Escape.,87,All right...
26671,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Let's begin, then."
26672,Duel x and x Escape.,87,What?
26673,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Chiona's squadron is missing?
26674,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Yes...
26675,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Is it similar to what happened \Nto Reikei's squadron?
26676,Duel x and x Escape.,87,It appears so.
26677,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"The leader disappeared first, and then the rest vanished, one by one."
26678,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Are the humans fighting back?
26679,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Well, that is the logical conclusion."
26680,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"We've been cutting down on \Nthe number of soldiers, and our prey has begun to scatter."
26681,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If humans target us during an extended hunt, it could be trouble."
26682,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?
26683,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"No, we can't trouble the Queen right now."
26684,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?
26685,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That idea doesn't thrill me...
26686,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll let you handle things outside...
26687,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We'll protect the inside of the castle.
26688,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll try to strengthen this.
26689,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Just as I expected...
26690,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Well, at least she doesn't issue \Nany strange orders on a whim."
26691,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We should start by determining \Nour current troop strength.
26692,Duel x and x Escape.,87,How many Squadron Leaders remain?
26693,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight."
26694,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...
26695,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And each officer commands \Nten to fifteen soldiers.
26696,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Some squadrons are under tight control, but many are free to wander around."
26697,Duel x and x Escape.,87,The missing four squadrons fall \Nunder the latter category...
26698,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Of the remaining squadrons, \Nover half lack discipline."
26699,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And none will heed a warning.
26700,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Nen{\i0
26701,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Then we could use them to lay a trap.
26702,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'm sure that's what's currently going \Nthrough the enemy's mind...
26703,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Well, we should be able to \Ncontinue the current plan."
26704,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Yes.
26705,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Knov and I will be able to tell \Nonce a trap has been laid.
26706,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"In fact, I believe we should \Nspring a few of those traps."
26707,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Hmm?
26708,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If we ignore the disciplined squads, they'll band together and cause us problems."
26709,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Most likely, they'll start pairing disciplined and undisciplined squads together."
26710,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If we launch an indiscriminate \Nattack, it will result in chaos."
26711,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We should be able to eliminate \Nanother three or four squads before the enemy tries another approach.
26712,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I can already see their next move.
26713,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"If all goes well, we'll finish up \Nbefore reinforcements arrive."
26714,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I hope things go that way.
26715,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Okay, three hours! All done!"
26716,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Well, then... Get going."
26717,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Here.
26718,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"What, there are more of you?"
26719,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Don't hold back...
26720,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Help yourselves.
26721,Duel x and x Escape.,87,They're here.
26722,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"It's on, Knuckle!"
26723,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Yeah, let's go!"
26724,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I'll take you both on at once!
26725,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I won't say a word about how you're condescending to us...
26726,Duel x and x Escape.,87,We're more than happy to accept!
26727,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Let's go, Killua!"
26728,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Yeah!
26729,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Come on...
26730,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I have no time to waste playing \Naround with you kids.
26731,Duel x and x Escape.,87,You have nothing but time.
26732,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Get serious!
26733,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That's more like it!
26734,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Their bodies are completely fatigued.
26735,Duel x and x Escape.,87,All that's moving them is sheer willpower.
26736,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Once they've accomplished \Nthe tough task before them, they'll gain a confidence boost \Nthat will spur their growth."
26737,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"However, to complete that task, \Nthey must defeat me!"
26738,Duel x and x Escape.,87,And that ain't gonna happen on my watch!
26739,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Come on!
26740,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That all you've got?
26741,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Given his personality, he's probably already warmed \Nto these opponents..."
26742,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"I doubt he'd sell me out, but it's probable that he'll accidentally \Nsay something he shouldn't."
26743,Duel x and x Escape.,87,My chance will come after they leave.
26744,Duel x and x Escape.,87,I will defeat them...
26745,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Next time:
26746,Duel x and x Escape.,87,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.
26747,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Hey, Killua."
26748,Duel x and x Escape.,87,"Stop it, my turn..."
26749,Duel x and x Escape.,87,That's our weakness!
26750,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Given his personality, he's probably already warmed \Nto these opponents..."
26751,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"I doubt he'd sell me out, but it's probable that he'll accidentally \Nsay something he shouldn't."
26752,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,My chance will come after they leave.
26753,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I will defeat them...
26754,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness
26755,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The man targeting Gon and Killua is named Shoot McMahon.
26756,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"He, too, is one of Morel's students."
26757,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,This won't work.
26758,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"In our current condition, \Nwe don't stand a chance..."
26759,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yeah.
26760,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using \Nless than half of his strength.
26761,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Probably so.
26762,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,But we have to fight him.
26763,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yeah...
26764,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I don't sense anyone else around.
26765,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,It's the perfect chance.
26766,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"When I take my target down, I am \Nalways deliberate and thorough."
26767,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.
26768,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Here we go... This is my chance.
26769,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,What's wrong?
26770,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,It's the perfect opportunity.
26771,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Right now, I can easily..."
26772,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Go...
26773,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Go!
26774,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Shoot McMahon...
26775,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He is a coward.
26776,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Hey, Killua..."
26777,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?
26778,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Hmm? What do you mean?
26779,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Why didn't they let him go to NGL?
26780,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He seems really strong to me.
26781,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Well, that's true."
26782,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"In terms of physical ability, \Nhe'd be a match for Kite."
26783,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,It's probably a mental thing.
26784,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Mental?
26785,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,His approach isn't in line \Nwith this mission's objective.
26786,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He's too soft.
26787,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And he gets attached to animals too easily.
26788,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"And he did end up volunteering \Nto help us, somehow..."
26789,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.
26790,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yeah...
26791,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,They can maintain their{\i0
26792,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That's a good sign...
26793,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If they can do it for three hours,"
26794,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I might consider letting them fight \NKnuckle when they're fully rested.
26795,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Knuckle will then be forced \Nto use his full strength.
26796,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I hope it will be enough to teach them...
26797,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"That which they lack, that which they need."
26798,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,But that still only takes them halfway.
26799,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If everything goes well, it'll take them \Nabout ten days to reach that point."
26800,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And that means they'll have no more \Nthan a day left before time's up...
26801,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm not sure they can make it.
26802,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I should probably prepare for my escape...
26803,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Save my own skin.
26804,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Help yourself.
26805,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Thanks!
26806,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yum!
26807,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,What do you think?
26808,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Oh, this is really good!"
26809,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Not that!
26810,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We only have ten days.
26811,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Huh?
26812,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"From what I've seen, you're only two-thirds through your training to become strong enough to force Knuckle into using his full strength..."
26813,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Uh-oh...
26814,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,She knows exactly what's going on.
26815,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Huh? Is that true, Bisky?"
26816,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,But it'll be fine!
26817,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!
26818,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,How can you be so sure?!
26819,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The situation hasn't improved at all...
26820,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"You said it was all right for \Nme to speak up, so I will."
26821,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!
26822,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,They didn't give you enough time...
26823,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife, staring at it to calm myself."
26824,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"That means I'm nearly over the edge, so if you run at once, before it's too late, \NI probably won't try to chase and kill you."
26825,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,If not for her outbursts...
26826,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,This would be a pleasant meal...
26827,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We aren't gonna run away.
26828,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,How many times do I have to say it?
26829,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,What else can you do?
26830,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!"
26831,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We'll win!
26832,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Pinky swear.
26833,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Come on... Hurry up!
26834,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle \Nand Shoot before the deadline.
26835,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If I break my promise, I have to \Nswallow a thousand needles..."
26836,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Pinky sworn!
26837,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"On the island I'm from, there's another part."
26838,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You go like this and put your thumbs together.
26839,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Sealed with a kiss!
26840,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Okay, now it's a promise."
26841,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"By the way, Palm-san, \Nwhat did you use to flavor this?"
26842,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones..."
26843,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.
26844,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I suspect she's the one leading \Nthings in that direction...
26845,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight, then I let it sit for another night."
26846,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Ten days left.
26847,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Don't say that like a countdown to our death!
26848,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,This is it...
26849,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Smoke that covers the forest like fog.
26850,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Baital squad here.
26851,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Goran, give me an update."
26852,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Goran, do you read me?"
26853,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Goran!
26854,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Could they have already taken him out?
26855,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Anyone from Goran's squad out there?
26856,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Give me a report!
26857,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Hey...
26858,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We can't see anything with all this smoke...
26859,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"We've been trying to reach Squadron \NLeader Goran, but he won't respond!"
26860,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Any sign of the leader?
26861,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I can't see the guy in front \Nof me! What's going on?!
26862,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I've lost contact with him!
26863,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He was right beside me a moment ago!
26864,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I can't see a thing!
26865,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He just vanished into the smoke!
26866,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yah! There's a hole!
26867,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"With all these messages, \NI can't tell what's happening..."
26868,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,They should've established a communication \Nnetwork to operate in the leader's absence.
26869,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Baital squad, forward!"
26870,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.
26871,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act \Nas rearguard for the Baital squad!
26872,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Proceed in a V formation!
26873,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The number of soldiers is dropping.
26874,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,What's happening?
26875,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Now.
26876,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Hey, Baital?"
26877,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,So you're next?
26878,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Are you sure this is a good idea?
26879,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,What do you mean?
26880,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,All we do is send enemies to the old man.
26881,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He's the one who takes them out.
26882,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,This is a little too easy.
26883,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,But it is a surefire method.
26884,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Can't argue there.
26885,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The Chairman was being modest...
26886,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He's still much stronger than we are.
26887,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And he seems rather excited about this.
26888,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Oh, speak of the devil."
26889,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Keep sending them my way.
26890,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm finally starting to regain my touch.
26891,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Impressive...
26892,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And how about the Queen?
26893,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,She hasn't made a move.
26894,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The Queen is still holed up in her nest.
26895,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Then the King hasn't been born yet.
26896,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Continue to monitor the situation.
26897,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Roger that.
26898,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The old man's on a roll.
26899,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Shall we grab another squadron?
26900,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yeah.
26901,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.
26902,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We're down to fourteen squadrons.
26903,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Damned humans.
26904,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,How are they managing to whittle us down?
26905,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I don't know.
26906,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,All I know is that there are some \Nhumans who are very strong.
26907,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We know too little about humans.
26908,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,They appear to possess a variety \Nof powers far stronger than ours.
26909,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Had we more time, we could \Nobtain that power, as well."
26910,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"However, once the King is born, \Nwe will hold the advantage."
26911,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Yes, I hope that will be the case."
26912,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You want to come out?
26913,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Not yet.
26914,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,It's still too early.
26915,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Okay, that's three hours!"
26916,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Oh? Already?
26917,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That seemed fast.
26918,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.
26919,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Huh?
26920,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?
26921,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You can go once you're rested.
26922,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Defeat him.
26923,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You have a little over a day \Nbefore the Chairman's deadline.
26924,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,This may be your first and last chance.
26925,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Well, if they're able to fight at full strength, \Nthey'll have to accept the results, win or lose."
26926,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If they can each identify what they're missing, then this training was a success."
26927,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Now, the problem is figuring out my escape..."
26928,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Seems you kids are serious tonight.
26929,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Morning, Youpi."
26930,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Youpi?
26931,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi."
26932,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm hungry.
26933,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Before we begin, I want to \Nknow where your partner is."
26934,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Eh? You mean Shoot?
26935,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Yeah.
26936,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Why do you want to know that?
26937,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.
26938,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We need both tokens.
26939,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That's a riot!
26940,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If you defeat me, I'll tell you."
26941,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We might not get a chance to ask you then.
26942,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You might be out cold.
26943,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,You're no longer amusing me...
26944,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,There!
26945,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Gon!
26946,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That hit hard.
26947,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I could feel the impact \Nthroughout my entire body.
26948,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,If I drop my{\i0
26949,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"After another four or five warm-up punches,"
26950,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'll get serious...
26951,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Better watch yourself.
26952,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I warm up fast.
26953,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Still no one coming out today?
26954,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,No.
26955,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"As expected, they've holed up inside."
26956,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Shall we make our move?
26957,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"No, we're approaching the \Ndeadline for your disciples."
26958,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We can wait until that's over.
26959,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Judging by the estimated number of \Nbodies currently stored in the nest, they'll need to replenish in a week or so."
26960,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I would like to dispatch another two or three squadrons at that time.
26961,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Okay, I'll leave it in your hands."
26962,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We don't move until we know \Nhow our disciples performed.
26963,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I think it's a waste of time...
26964,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help, but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable."
26965,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,We can't count on them for anything in a fight.
26966,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"At best, they could act as decoys."
26967,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Hell, they'd probably get in our way..."
26968,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm certain of it.
26969,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,That old man always was a gambler...
26970,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Want to bet whose disciples \Nwill show up tomorrow?
26971,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot."
26972,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If we're both wrong, \Nthe Chairman gets the money."
26973,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,How about it?
26974,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Sure.
26975,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Then, I'll put..."
26976,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"...1,000,000 on them."
26977,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Huh? That's just impossible!
26978,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?
26979,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,The Chairman is a dog?
26980,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I happen to love gambling.
26981,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I always roll high...
26982,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,There!
26983,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Behind you, fool!"
26984,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,He's still warming up?
26985,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Damn, he's strong!"
26986,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,But why is Knuckle...
26987,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Could it be...
26988,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Hey, aren't you going to use \Nthat ""First comes rock"" thing?"
26989,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"Well, you won't be able to use that technique."
26990,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"It's flawed, after all."
26991,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,It's flawed?
26992,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,A word of advice...
26993,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"If you try that technique, \NI'll stop you in your tracks."
26994,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,"In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it."
26995,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Your technique has two huge weaknesses!
26996,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission without sacrificing someone...
26997,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.
26998,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And love and sorrow!
26999,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,And reassurance...
27000,Rock-Paper-Scissors x And x Weakness.,88,No biggie!
27001,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Your technique has two huge weaknesses!
27002,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Compassion x And x Strength
27003,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Gon has finally challenged \NKnuckle to a serious fight.
27004,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"However, Knuckle claims that \NGon's technique has serious flaws."
27005,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"So, Gon..."
27006,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,What did you name that technique?
27007,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.
27008,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Ja-Janken!
27009,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Wow, zero effort..."
27010,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Jajanken...
27011,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I understand.
27012,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"You combined ""jajan"" for ""ta-dah,"" with \N""janken"" for your attack, ""Rock-Paper-Scissors."""
27013,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Ah, no..."
27014,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"The first ""ja"" was a stutter."
27015,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Not a bad name, kid!"
27016,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Uh, yeah."
27017,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Guess I'm okay with that.
27018,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You are?!
27019,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses."
27020,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"First, it takes too long to charge."
27021,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"During a fight, you don't have time \Nto stand still for several seconds."
27022,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.
27023,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I know that.
27024,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Second, it's too risky."
27025,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"When you focus aura in your \Nfist to increase power, you have less aura for defense."
27026,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"One attack to the wrong place \Nwill take you out, fool!"
27027,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I know the risks.
27028,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That's why I've spent the past month \Ntraining to compensate for them!
27029,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Now that I see it again, \Nhis aura really is something."
27030,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"In terms of volume, he has \Nas much as a mid-level pro."
27031,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's so close...
27032,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,But you still lack experience.
27033,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You haven't been in enough real fights!
27034,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You've got plenty of determination.
27035,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"It seems you've looked death \Nin the eye many times, and you have natural talent."
27036,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"However, you're still unrefined."
27037,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Your aura is too rough!
27038,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I can tell which area you're defending.
27039,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I can see what you're trying to do.
27040,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Your aura gives it all away.
27041,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"So if I use that information to fake you out, shifting your intended point of attack..."
27042,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,This is the result!
27043,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Damn...
27044,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,His aura is giving away his every move!
27045,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I was right! Knuckle really is...
27046,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Okay, then..."
27047,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Time to throw a real punch.
27048,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's so...
27049,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Don't blame me if you die.
27050,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's so gentle!
27051,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Behind you, fool!"
27052,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Without his warning, I could have died."
27053,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"First, it takes too long to charge."
27054,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...
27055,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,And providing guidance.
27056,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's telling me how to become stronger.
27057,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's too gentle!
27058,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,First comes rock...
27059,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I told you that you won't pull off that attack.
27060,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Don't fool around with me!
27061,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That was your full strength?
27062,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Which one of us is fooling around?!
27063,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,It's supposed to be a serious fight!
27064,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!"
27065,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,First comes rock...
27066,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Here I go!
27067,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Rock...
27068,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Over here!
27069,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,First comes rock...
27070,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Rock...
27071,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Bastard...
27072,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He faked me out with his Jajanken.
27073,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,It's obvious that you're focused \Non stopping my special attack.
27074,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Even I could tell exactly when your \Nright arm was going to strike.
27075,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long \Ncharge time, against his opponent."
27076,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's playing mind games.
27077,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.
27078,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He has to swing for it.
27079,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"It's a perfect pitch, right down the \Nmiddle, that he has to send flying."
27080,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That's the trigger.
27081,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"When you see the easy ball, you tense up."
27082,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You can hit it. You have to.
27083,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,These thoughts make you use \Nmore strength than necessary.
27084,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,The same thing applies to aura.
27085,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,If a {\i0 it will gather in areas of tension.
27086,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"The moment of the swing, it intensifies further."
27087,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,If the{\i0 the aura will either stagnate \Nor just flow too freely.
27088,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,The flow of the aura lets the opponent sense \Nwhen an attack will come.
27089,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!"
27090,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"By calling him out for being soft, \NGon threw Knuckle off."
27091,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out."
27092,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'd think this tactic would be more effective \Non those who know Jajanken's strength.
27093,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Opponents who have seen how \Nstrong the technique can be will be more scared and likely to lose \Ncontrol when they see it coming.
27094,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"The fake-out will be more believable, and if the enemy steps back, they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper."
27095,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I always assumed Jajanken would be less useful once opponents \Nfigured out how it works.
27096,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That it was flawed.
27097,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,But I was wrong.
27098,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,It can be adapted to any situation.
27099,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Okay, let's try this again."
27100,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"In the second attempt, he was \Ntoo focused on the technique and let Knuckle land a kick on him."
27101,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"But if he learns to better control his aura \Nin response to the opponent's movement, it will be harder to distinguish between fake and real Jajanken attempts."
27102,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Gon's been thinking how to shore \Nup his technique's weaknesses.
27103,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,No...
27104,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He thought of the solution during this fight.
27105,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He's making incredible progress while fighting.
27106,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'm already getting tired.
27107,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,We haven't even been \Nfighting for twenty minutes.
27108,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Moving so much is sapping my energy.
27109,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If an hour of training is comparable \Nto ten minutes of fighting,"
27110,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'll only be able to maintain my {\i0
27111,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished."
27112,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Before then, I have to end this."
27113,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,By using Jajanken.
27114,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Bring it!
27115,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.
27116,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"But Gon is adapting, little by little."
27117,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"By increasing the area his aura covers, he reduces the damage from miscalculations."
27118,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.
27119,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.
27120,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,But he's running out of time.
27121,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He doesn't have much stamina \Nleft to maintain his aura.
27122,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"On the other hand, Knuckle has \Nbeen conserving his strength, only attacking with physical blows."
27123,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Jajanken requires a large \Namount of aura just to charge.
27124,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.
27125,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Gon's already activated his technique three times.
27126,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,They started fighting twenty minutes ago.
27127,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If he uses Jajanken again, \Nhe'll only have a minute or two to fight at full strength."
27128,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Gon...
27129,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"You told me to use my full strength, but you're no match for me right now."
27130,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You're...
27131,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,First comes rock...
27132,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Why?
27133,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,What... is he going to do?
27134,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,First comes rock...
27135,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Why?
27136,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Knuckle's in good shape and alert, \Nand he's attacking from that distance?"
27137,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.
27138,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,This is definitely Gon's final attack.
27139,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,This will end it.
27140,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Rock... Scissors...
27141,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Paper!
27142,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,An Emitter attack?
27143,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,But it's much weaker than his Rock.
27144,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You're definitely an Enhancer.
27145,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Your power as an Emitter is far lower.
27146,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,No speed... No punch.
27147,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.
27148,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Once I knock that aside, it's over!"
27149,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Once again!
27150,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Once again?
27151,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He used that ball as cover \Nto move behind me?
27152,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Crap!
27153,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Two Jajankens in a row...
27154,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Rock!
27155,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He must have depleted his \Naura before Rock hit.
27156,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground..."
27157,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Where are you going, fool?"
27158,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'm going back.
27159,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Aren't you going to fight?
27160,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'm fine here.
27161,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You can fight Gon again tomorrow.
27162,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,The outcome will probably be different.
27163,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'll defeat Shoot.
27164,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Tell Gon this.
27165,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real."
27166,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,He'd better be prepared to die.
27167,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
27168,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Sure you're up to the task?
27169,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Hell, yeah, fool."
27170,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Tomorrow...
27171,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"As long as you win, it's fine if you don't get serious."
27172,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"But if you lose without fighting at full strength,"
27173,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I won't forgive you.
27174,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"I'll never forgive you, as long as I live."
27175,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You're still soft.
27176,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Why are you helping the enemy?
27177,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well..."
27178,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If you don't want to go to NGL, \Nhand over your token to them."
27179,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.
27180,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Bastard...
27181,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"You're pretty cocky when you aren't \Nshaking in your boots, eh?"
27182,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"The past month, all you've done is stalk them!"
27183,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'll fight.
27184,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Tomorrow, I'll join the fight."
27185,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Don't worry.
27186,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight in top condition tomorrow."
27187,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Killua's the real issue...
27188,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I wasn't expecting him to go the whole month without fighting once.
27189,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Killua!
27190,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Fight me.
27191,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Huh?
27192,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"What happened to your face, Killua?!"
27193,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Huh? I was training with Bisky.
27194,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?
27195,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Anyway, are you feeling okay?"
27196,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Yep, I feel great."
27197,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"I used up all my aura, so I expected \Nto be tired, but look!"
27198,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That gorill—
27199,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That old hag's massage must have done the trick.
27200,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,That was close.
27201,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Listen now...
27202,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,"
27203,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I'll make your face three times worse.
27204,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,She wasn't joking.
27205,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Now, do you know your weakness?"
27206,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You're too quick to give up.
27207,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You're too cautious about fighting.
27208,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Some might say you underestimate yourself.
27209,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"When facing an enemy you \Nbelieve to be stronger, you fight on the premise of escaping."
27210,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I realize that this isn't your fault.
27211,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
27212,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Habits that are burned into your \Nbody and soul aren't easy to break.
27213,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,But I can say one thing for sure.
27214,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Somewhere down the line, \Nyou'll leave Gon behind to die."
27215,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Combat ability can change, depending on environment \Nand physical condition."
27216,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"For example, a good-condition C has a high chance of defeating \Na poor-condition D."
27217,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If the conditions are right, A, B, and C all have the potential to defeat D."
27218,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"But in your case, you're assuming the enemy is always at their best."
27219,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You always assume the worst-case scenario.
27220,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Even when facing enemies with equal strength, you worry about how strong they are, \Nor what they might do to you."
27221,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If we're talking about a stronger \Nenemy, there's no question..."
27222,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,You don't bother to think of how you could win.
27223,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Running is your only option. \NThat's how losers think.
27224,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself to face enemies stronger than \Nyou will take determination.
27225,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow, you must leave Gon's side."
27226,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Okay! I'm gonna win this time!
27227,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Let's go.
27228,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Yeah.
27229,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Killua's overly cautious style is the \Nproduct of a smothering love.
27230,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"A twisted, self-serving love..."
27231,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"That just makes his habits stronger, \Ndeeper, and harder to break."
27232,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Without extraordinary willpower, \Nthis curse cannot be broken."
27233,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,I don't know who will emerge victorious...
27234,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"All right, then..."
27235,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Time to run for it.
27236,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,The loser...
27237,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Hands his token to the winner.
27238,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Gon and Knuckle.
27239,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Killua and Shoot.
27240,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Their final battle begins.
27241,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,Next time: Interest x And x Curse.
27242,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Who are you calling slow, fool?"
27243,Compassion x And x Strength.,89,"Are you saying I'm cursed, fool?"
27244,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's so...
27245,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's so gentle!
27246,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...
27247,Interest x And x Curse.,90,And providing guidance.
27248,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's telling me how to become stronger.
27249,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"When facing an enemy you \Nbelieve to be stronger, you fight on the premise of escaping."
27250,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Somewhere down the line, \Nyou'll leave Gon behind to die."
27251,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow, you must leave Gon's side."
27252,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Interest x And x Curse
27253,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,"
27254,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Gon and Killua are deep in thought.
27255,Interest x And x Curse.,90,The loser...
27256,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Hands his token to the winner.
27257,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Gon...
27258,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"As promised,"
27259,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I'm coming at you at full power!
27260,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me."
27261,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I have to be ready to take the hit...
27262,Interest x And x Curse.,90,And counterattack!
27263,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Don't follow him by sight.
27264,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Sense his motions...
27265,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Through my aura!
27266,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"A little late, but I sensed his approach!"
27267,Interest x And x Curse.,90,But what's going on?
27268,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I feel power rushing through my body...
27269,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27270,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27271,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Wh-What is this thing?
27272,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I let you borrow some of my aura.
27273,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You let me borrow your aura?
27274,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"By the way, I charge ten percent interest."
27275,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Ten percent every ten seconds!
27276,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust."
27277,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27278,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27279,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"I call this ability ""Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."""
27280,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
27281,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens \NChapter 7 Bankruptcy
27282,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector."
27283,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Attacking APR is a waste of time...
27284,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"It'll just hang around you, \Ntelling you when your interest goes up."
27285,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's both harmless and invincible.
27286,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Though it can be an eyesore...
27287,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27288,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27289,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Again.
27290,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It doesn't hurt at all...
27291,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Instead, I feel another power rush."
27292,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27293,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27294,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It suddenly almost doubled?!
27295,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's because I just lent you another 180 aura.
27296,Interest x And x Curse.,90,180 aura?
27297,Interest x And x Curse.,90,What do these numbers mean?
27298,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.
27299,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"""180 aura"" is a numeric measure \Nof your spiritual power."
27300,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Aura accumulates in the body, and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP) varies according to your training."
27301,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Also, there is a limit on how much \Naura you're able to release at once, which can be raised through training."
27302,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"In other words,"
27303,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Present aura Output Potential [POP] your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter."
27304,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,"
27305,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Present aura Output Potential [POP] \N\NActualized aura Output Potential [AOP] the amount of aura you can actually release,"
27306,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"1000 aura                                      200 aura you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?"
27307,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Ken{\i0 a maximum 1,800 aura around your body."
27308,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"When preparing for battle, you usually expend 1 aura per second."
27309,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"However, once the fight begins,"
27310,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Gyo, Ryu{\i0"
27311,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Nen{\i0
27312,Interest x And x Curse.,90,This increases the rate you expend \Naura by six to ten times.
27313,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"The stronger your techniques, \Nthe more aura you use up."
27314,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Got that, fool?"
27315,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Your control is still weak, so you're burning 10 aura every second."
27316,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.
27317,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"In yesterday's fight, you ran \Nout after twenty minutes..."
27318,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura."
27319,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Then add your four Jajankens!
27320,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Your AOP is around 1,800 aura."
27321,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Jan{\i0 in your fist was over 2,000."
27322,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"That's due to its long charge and your defensive \Nsacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist."
27323,Interest x And x Curse.,90,A special provision covers such risks \Nattributed to special attacks.
27324,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"You expended around 5,500 aura \Nwith the first three Jajanken shots!"
27325,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500."
27326,Interest x And x Curse.,90,As for the fourth shot...
27327,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy."
27328,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Assuming that you needed twice the \Nusual aura amount to complete the attack, the fourth shot required 4,000 aura."
27329,Interest x And x Curse.,90,The amount of aura used up is \Nthe same for Rock and Paper.
27330,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"However, Paper falls within a different category, and you haven't practiced much, so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack."
27331,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That probably only had the strength \Nof about a 500-aura attack.
27332,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Thus, your maximum POP is around 21,500 aura!"
27333,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...
27334,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Looks like you're not good at math.
27335,Interest x And x Curse.,90,But I'm just getting started!
27336,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Listen up, fool!"
27337,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"When your borrowed aura, including interest, surpasses your current remaining POP, you'll bust."
27338,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Aura works like a bank account balance.
27339,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you keep spending, your balance decreases..."
27340,Interest x And x Curse.,90,But the interest keeps skyrocketing!
27341,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's been a few minutes since we started.
27342,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"You've used up at least 2,000."
27343,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Take a look.
27344,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's huge!
27345,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's not all...
27346,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's three times what it was before?
27347,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That can't be right!
27348,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's only been two or three minutes!
27349,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"To be precise, it's been 120 seconds."
27350,Interest x And x Curse.,90,This exemplifies how interest \Ncan snowball on you.
27351,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27352,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27353,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Even after adding in the
27354,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000."
27355,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Your debt will continue to grow.
27356,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Even if you stand perfectly still, in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds, you'll bust."
27357,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Bankrupt
27358,Interest x And x Curse.,90,What happens if I bust?
27359,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Ren{\i0 and spend thirty days tracking the target.
27360,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Zetsu{\i0
27361,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Nen{\i0
27362,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!"
27363,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.
27364,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He held back for my sake...
27365,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Knuckle!
27366,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Thank you.
27367,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Here I come!
27368,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That punch just now was around 150...
27369,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"You returned 150 to me, \Nbut I lent you another 180."
27370,Interest x And x Curse.,90,The net impact is that your \Nloan increases by 30...
27371,Interest x And x Curse.,90,What will you do now?
27372,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Until your debt is repaid,"
27373,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I won't take damage from your attacks.
27374,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27375,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27376,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Yeah, come at me, fool!"
27377,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you just stand around, you'll bust \Nafter the four minutes expire!"
27378,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You managed to land more hits.
27379,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"But ultimately, you only returned about 100."
27380,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27381,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27382,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's just a drop in the bucket.
27383,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You repaid less than half your \Nlast interest payment...
27384,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I won't let you launch Jajanken again.
27385,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Once your debt passes 10,000, \Nmy victory is assured."
27386,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's time.
27387,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Adding interest.
27388,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Wh-What is that?
27389,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Can't let him intimidate me.
27390,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Neither of us knows anything \Nabout the other's abilities!
27391,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I don't like hurting other people.
27392,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's why I chose a power that only activates when I must hurt someone.
27393,Interest x And x Curse.,90,To give myself a weapon that only works against those I have no qualms about hurting.
27394,Interest x And x Curse.,90,However...
27395,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You boys have taught me that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.
27396,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Three hands?
27397,Interest x And x Curse.,90,How?
27398,Interest x And x Curse.,90,They're floating?!
27399,Interest x And x Curse.,90,What kind of power is this?
27400,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Should I attack first?
27401,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Stay calm...
27402,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Observe the situation with{\i0
27403,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's not using {\i0
27404,Interest x And x Curse.,90,There are three floating hands.
27405,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"That means, most likely, he's a Manipulator."
27406,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That cage is also a mystery.
27407,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He doesn't need it if he plans to use those flying hands to attack.
27408,Interest x And x Curse.,90,In other words...
27409,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Touching those hands is dangerous!
27410,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Yo-yos, huh?"
27411,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Let's see what you can do.
27412,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's amazingly adept...
27413,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's fast!
27414,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Those hands were just a distraction?
27415,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Jump back.
27416,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"When facing an enemy you \Nbelieve to be stronger, you fight on the premise of escaping."
27417,Interest x And x Curse.,90,No way...
27418,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's no different from what I've always done.
27419,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Use electricity!
27420,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Couldn't get the attack off!
27421,Interest x And x Curse.,90,My body won't listen to me...
27422,Interest x And x Curse.,90,This... is my curse.
27423,Interest x And x Curse.,90,His reaction was slow.
27424,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Is something wrong?
27425,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Stop... Don't think about it.
27426,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's my bad habit.
27427,Interest x And x Curse.,90,His circumstances don't matter.
27428,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Do my best to defeat him.
27429,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!"
27430,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He's strong and fast.
27431,Interest x And x Curse.,90,He probably has me beat in every area...
27432,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"That's right, Killua..."
27433,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That's the way.
27434,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.
27435,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I have to stop thinking that way!
27436,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Your weakness is that you're \Ntoo quick to give up.
27437,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Even when facing enemies with equal strength, you worry about how strong they are, \Nor what they might do to you."
27438,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If we're talking about a stronger \Nenemy, there's no question..."
27439,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You don't bother to think of how you could win.
27440,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Running is your only option. \NThat's how losers think.
27441,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I realize that this isn't your fault.
27442,Interest x And x Curse.,90,It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
27443,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Habits that are burned into your \Nbody and soul aren't easy to break.
27444,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Somewhere down the line, \Nyou'll leave Gon behind to die."
27445,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Forget it.
27446,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You can't win.
27447,Interest x And x Curse.,90,My left eye?
27448,Interest x And x Curse.,90,The left side of my face is gone...
27449,Interest x And x Curse.,90,That was a much better reaction.
27450,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Was what happened earlier a fluke?
27451,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you take damage without knowing why, get as far from the enemy as you can."
27452,Interest x And x Curse.,90,My curse saved me.
27453,Interest x And x Curse.,90,But that isn't good enough!
27454,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself to face enemies stronger than \Nyou will take determination.
27455,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I must fight to win!
27456,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I'm blind on the left side...
27457,Interest x And x Curse.,90,There it was again.
27458,Interest x And x Curse.,90,You reacted quickly.
27459,Interest x And x Curse.,90,No! I'm just running away!
27460,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I haven't been fighting at all...
27461,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow, you must leave Gon's side!"
27462,Interest x And x Curse.,90,I'm done running away.
27463,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Take this...
27464,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Electricity?
27465,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Scary.
27466,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Doesn't matter... Follow him.
27467,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Never overpursue.
27468,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Go after him!
27469,Interest x And x Curse.,90,How—
27470,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Stop.
27471,Interest x And x Curse.,90,...did you know?
27472,Interest x And x Curse.,90,What am I asking that for?
27473,Interest x And x Curse.,90,While Gon and Killua were fighting for the tokens...
27474,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Next time: The Strong x And x The Weak.
27475,Interest x And x Curse.,90,"Here I come, Killua..."
27476,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Time to eat!
27477,Interest x And x Curse.,90,Bring it!
27478,Interest x And x Curse.,90,My yakiniku meal.
27479,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,How—
27480,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Stop.
27481,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,...did you know?
27482,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,What am I asking that for?
27483,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It's time.
27484,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Adding interest.
27485,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The Strong x And x The Weak
27486,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The time has finally come.
27487,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,At long last...
27488,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Yep.
27489,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The King is about to be born!
27490,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Wait...
27491,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It's too early!
27492,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Silence!
27493,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I hunger.
27494,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Bring me food.
27495,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Th-This is our King...
27496,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Your Majesty!
27497,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"O-Oh, no..."
27498,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Her organs are severely damaged!
27499,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Do not make me repeat myself.
27500,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Bring me food.
27501,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,This is a filthy place...
27502,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You...
27503,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Clean this off.
27504,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Ah, I happen to have a handkerchief on me—"
27505,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Do not make me repeat myself.
27506,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I am speaking to you.
27507,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Clean this off.
27508,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Disgusting.
27509,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Where is my food?
27510,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"This way, please."
27511,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We have prepared a meal for you.
27512,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The three of us will serve \Nas your arms and legs.
27513,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We shall acquire anything you wish...
27514,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,And fulfill all of your desires.
27515,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We await your command.
27516,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Help the Queen!
27517,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Stop the bleeding!
27518,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Well? How is she?
27519,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It looks grim...
27520,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,She's in very bad shape.
27521,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Multiple organs have been crushed \Nso badly, we cannot heal them!"
27522,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,If something isn't done...
27523,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Neferpitou-dono!
27524,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The Queen is dying...
27525,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We require your assistance!
27526,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We need the power you \Nused to heal that man!
27527,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I only healed him because I need him.
27528,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Now that the King has been born, she means nothing to the Royal Guard."
27529,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,She is no longer necessary.
27530,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Your Majesty!
27531,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
27532,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?
27533,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"No, Neferpitou-dono has..."
27534,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,No...
27535,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They have all abandoned the Queen.
27536,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Abandoned?
27537,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!
27538,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It's impossible!
27539,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Weren't you listening to me?
27540,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We don't have the power to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...
27541,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Perhaps they have the power we need.
27542,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Who are you talking about?
27543,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Hey, where are you going?"
27544,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"We have prepared your dinner on the roof, \Nwhere there is a fine view."
27545,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Then, it would seem faster \Nto get there from outside."
27546,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Magnificent...
27547,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Excuse me.
27548,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,That looks fun...
27549,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It seems I need practice.
27550,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Disgusting.
27551,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You don't like it?
27552,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It is horrendously bland.
27553,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We haven't been seasoning our food...
27554,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"No, that is not what I mean."
27555,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"When I was in her belly,"
27556,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"I was occasionally treated to \Nwonderfully rich, savory meals."
27557,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Ah, you must be talking \Nabout the rare humans."
27558,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,My body longs for that \Nindescribable satisfaction.
27559,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I wish to feast upon one of them.
27560,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,As you wish.
27561,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,In that case...
27562,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,One of them is heading straight for us.
27563,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Have we been seen?
27564,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Let's hide...
27565,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Wait.
27566,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Something seems off...
27567,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Look!
27568,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,A white flag?
27569,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We surrender!
27570,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We surrender!
27571,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,But there is one condition...
27572,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You must save the Queen!
27573,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,She no longer has the ability to give birth.
27574,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The Queen?
27575,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The King has already been born!
27576,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Impossible!
27577,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It's too early!
27578,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,He is...
27579,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They are all devils...
27580,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,What is this?
27581,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They put up no fight.
27582,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Disgusting.
27583,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,This is all wrong.
27584,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Might I offer some advice?
27585,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The brain is the most delicious part of a human.
27586,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,So I'd recommend dispatching your \Nprey without harming the head.
27587,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Is that so?
27588,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Like this?
27589,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Magnificent!
27590,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I see... This is not so bad.
27591,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,However...
27592,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"It is still inedible, \Nwhen compared to a rare human."
27593,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Might I offer more advice?
27594,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,There is a way to identify rare humans.
27595,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,If you use—
27596,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Do you insult me?
27597,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"I am aware that if I focus, I can see the \Nenergy around their bodies."
27598,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The volume of energy reveals their strength.
27599,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Please forgive my insolence.
27600,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Simply finding and consuming \Nthem is not entertaining.
27601,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"I enjoy the moments before eating, before it is clear whether \Nthe human is rare or not."
27602,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Since I have already alleviated my hunger.
27603,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Incidentally, Pitou..."
27604,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You are quite strong.
27605,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I was trying to kill you.
27606,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You have earned my respect.
27607,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I am unworthy.
27608,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I don't believe it...
27609,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,He ate a soldier... One of his own.
27610,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,That isn't entirely correct.
27611,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,He is a completely different organism.
27612,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I imagine he views all other creatures as food.
27613,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,So what should we do now?
27614,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,What do you mean?
27615,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"If the Queen dies, we'll lose \Nour reason to stay here."
27616,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?
27617,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The Queen can no longer reproduce.
27618,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Huh?
27619,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,That's true.
27620,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,It's no longer possible for the \NQueen to build her kingdom.
27621,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"In that case, each of us should \Ntry to become a king..."
27622,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,We can do as we please.
27623,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Do you realize what you're saying?
27624,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You think you can get away with this?
27625,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I'm sure we aren't the only ones \Nwho'd like to leave this place.
27626,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,W-Wait...
27627,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Now do you see that you're in the minority?
27628,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Please... There's no time!
27629,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"If the Queen dies, there will be nothing to hold \Nthe Squadron Leaders back."
27630,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Things will spin out of control.
27631,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,What exactly will happen then?
27632,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Most likely, they will imitate the King."
27633,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They will leave to build their own \Nkingdoms by spreading their seed.
27634,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"If the chain of command collapses, some of the Captains will also strike out alone."
27635,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They will scatter throughout the world \Nand destroy entire ecosystems.
27636,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Are Chimera Ant soldiers \Ncapable of reproduction?
27637,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Yes...
27638,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,They can copulate with females \Nof other species and reproduce.
27639,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen will not attempt to reproduce.
27640,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,But I've read reports of soldiers attempting to reproduce \Nfollowing a queen's death.
27641,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying."
27642,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,What's your name?
27643,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Colt.
27644,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Colt, we're going to take you to our boss."
27645,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I need you to tell your story to him directly.
27646,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"However,"
27647,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I don't know if he will trust you.
27648,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"And even if he believes your story, he may not let you leave alive."
27649,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Are you still willing to come with us?
27650,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Absolutely! Time is of the essence!
27651,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,The timing couldn't be worse.
27652,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Today is the day our disciples fight it out...
27653,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Oh! I completely forgot...
27654,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"I bet 100,000 that Knuckle \Nand Shoot would make it."
27655,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come..."
27656,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Knuckle...
27657,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Huh?
27658,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Promise me!
27659,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You have to...
27660,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,You have to save Kite!
27661,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Got it...
27662,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I promise I'll bring him back.
27663,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Rook
27664,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I swear on this token.
27665,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Killua...
27666,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I'm weak...
27667,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I never knew...
27668,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I never knew how frustrating weakness could be!
27669,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Gon...
27670,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,For the thirty days that you can't use{\i0
27671,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I'll protect you.
27672,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,I will do whatever it takes!
27673,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"After that, it's goodbye."
27674,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,Next time: One Wish x And x Two Promises.
27675,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,"Hey, a shooting star!"
27676,The Strong x And x The Weak.,91,May we always be together!
27677,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I never knew how frustrating weakness could be!
27678,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Gon...
27679,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,For the thirty days that you can't use{\i0
27680,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I'll protect you.
27681,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I will do whatever it takes!
27682,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,One Wish x And x Two Promises
27683,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Colt arrived, under a white flag of \Nsurrender, to ask the Hunters a favor."
27684,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,His wish was that they save the dying Queen.
27685,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"After hearing his request, Morel and \NKnov took Colt to see Netero."
27686,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It's me.
27687,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Send over a team of Chimera Ant \Nresearchers immediately.
27688,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Hmm?
27689,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,The king has been born.
27690,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School, and have him bring all his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts."
27691,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,We leave in four hours.
27692,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yes, sir."
27693,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,We will do everything we can.
27694,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Colt-kun...
27695,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,We'll need your cooperation.
27696,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Heart
27697,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,This may be the last time I wear this...
27698,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Hey, is that..."
27699,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yes, it's his ""heart"" T-shirt."
27700,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Heart
27701,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,They say it's a lucky shirt he only \Nwears when he fights for real.
27702,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,But I always thought it was a just a rumor...
27703,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Nen{\i0
27704,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Since you've been in the King's presence,"
27705,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I want you to give me your honest opinion.
27706,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,How do I compare to the King?
27707,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,He really is special...
27708,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It feels like needles pricking \Nme all over my body.
27709,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Most likely, you will be unable to lay a finger on him."
27710,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard before you can get close enough.
27711,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I see...
27712,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I'm happy to hear that.
27713,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"At this age, I'll be a challenger."
27714,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,This is exciting stuff.
27715,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Morel, I believe your disciples \Nwere to fight today, yes?"
27716,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Yes.
27717,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Take the victors and the research team, along with Colt, to the nest."
27718,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"And you, Chairman?"
27719,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You don't plan to pursue the King alone?
27720,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Oh, no..."
27721,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I'm off to see an old acquaintance.
27722,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Don't forget to pay me my one million.
27723,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I know.
27724,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,What are you talking about?
27725,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Nothing important.
27726,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Let's go.
27727,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Yeah.
27728,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Everyone else has left.
27729,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Most of our soldiers joined \Nother squadrons and left.
27730,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Though a few oddballs did leave \Ntheir squadrons to stay here.
27731,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.
27732,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Did you stop the bleeding?
27733,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her."
27734,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"I'm not sure we can, either. \NDon't expect too much."
27735,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs."
27736,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Can you use my organs?
27737,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"You can have all my blood, as well!"
27738,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Unfortunately, it won't work."
27739,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Chimera Ants from different generations \Nare completely different organisms.
27740,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Just look at how much the Chimera \NAnts in your own generation vary.
27741,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,But the sentiment is appreciated.
27742,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"We'll do our best, so pray..."
27743,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"That, miraculously, all the organs will function."
27744,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Pray...
27745,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Is that all I can do?
27746,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Someone...
27747,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Is anyone there?
27748,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yes, I am by your side!"
27749,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Please give me your command!
27750,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,What is it?
27751,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Telepathy?
27752,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yes, the Queen cannot speak as we do."
27753,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Can you tell us what she's saying?
27754,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.
27755,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,My son...
27756,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Is my son all right?
27757,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Did he have any defects?
27758,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,...defects?
27759,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You have nothing to worry about.
27760,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"He is perfectly healthy, and right now..."
27761,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"And right now, he's taken \Nthe Royal Guard to search for medicine to help you."
27762,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,...to help you.
27763,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"The truth is that, after he killed \Nand ate Squadron Leaders, he left in search of a new territory."
27764,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I doubt he will return.
27765,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,He ate them?
27766,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,The King has no concern for the Queen's health!
27767,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Then, the King is safe?"
27768,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Yes.
27769,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,That is wonderful...
27770,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Oh, no."
27771,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Send the King off at once.
27772,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,There is no time to waste on my well-being...
27773,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,My son has the potential to rule the world.
27774,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"He was born too early, so I was very worried."
27775,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"However, it appears..."
27776,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I have fulfilled my duty...
27777,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,That was all I wanted.
27778,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,What are you saying?!
27779,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You are our guiding light...
27780,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Without you, the rest of us will \Nlose our way and perish."
27781,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I know my body better than anyone else...
27782,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I will not last much longer.
27783,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"However, I have no regrets."
27784,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Please stop!
27785,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I beg you... Please live!
27786,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Use my body! Please!
27787,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Give it a shot!
27788,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Until you try, you don't know it won't work!"
27789,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Listen...
27790,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You must listen to what the Queen has to say.
27791,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I have one last request...
27792,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I thought of a name... for my son.
27793,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,For the King...
27794,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,A name?
27795,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Meruem.
27796,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It means the light that illuminates all.
27797,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Deliver my message to him...
27798,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,My beloved son...
27799,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I failed to protect her again...
27800,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I can't protect anyone...
27801,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Has something like this happened before?
27802,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"No, he's probably referring to a memory from when he was human."
27803,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You have memories from \Nwhen you were human?
27804,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Of course, though naturally, some \Nremember more than others..."
27805,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Our human personalities strongly influence our current behavior.
27806,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,And many can remember their human names.
27807,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Otherwise, it wouldn't have been \Nas easy to learn to speak."
27808,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Hmm?
27809,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Th-This is...
27810,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,There's...
27811,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,There's something moving!
27812,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Don't touch it!
27813,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I will...
27814,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I will remove it.
27815,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I shall protect this child...
27816,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I swear it!
27817,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"This time, I won't fail..."
27818,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Morel?
27819,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Colt...
27820,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Can you promise me that you and that child \Nwill never eat humans?
27821,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"If you can't make that promise, you should get out of my sight immediately."
27822,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,But if you're willing to give your word...
27823,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"No one will ever lay a finger on you, not as long as I'm around."
27824,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,You have my promise!
27825,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It isn't a big deal...
27826,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I inherited my soft nature from my master.
27827,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Okay, I've recovered!"
27828,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.
27829,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,So I have to become stronger!
27830,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,So that Kite won't be disappointed \Nwhen he comes back.
27831,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Ah, so you do understand."
27832,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"You may have met Kite before we did, but we've spent more time with him."
27833,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still \Nbeen moping, I would've given you a beating..."
27834,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,And told you that Kite wouldn't \Nwant to see you two like this.
27835,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"I know he's still alive, and he doesn't want you to have regrets."
27836,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Right now, what should you do?"
27837,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"You must make the correct decision, \Nand find the will to follow through!"
27838,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"If you're too weak, train more."
27839,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,There's enough space here \Nfor squats and push-ups.
27840,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Yeah, you're right."
27841,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Hey, Spin..."
27842,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Hmm?
27843,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Why do you want to be a Hunter?
27844,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I need the money to repay a huge debt.
27845,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Have you heard of the small-billed swan?
27846,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Nope...
27847,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It's a species of bird that can only live \Nin the area around a certain mine.
27848,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,No one knows why that is.
27849,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Is it the water? The food? The weather?
27850,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,So I bought the entire area where the mine is.
27851,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Well, the mine's closed down now."
27852,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Kite provided the money for that.
27853,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,He was the first adult who was willing to listen to kids who had nothing at all.
27854,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Stinn and I were born in that area.
27855,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking \Nflight with the light of dawn at their backs...
27856,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"That's the oldest, but strongest, \Nmemory Stinn and I have."
27857,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"When we heard the area would be demolished, we realized how important it was to us..."
27858,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Kite said that he envied us.
27859,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,He doesn't have a home.
27860,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Because he doesn't know where he was born.
27861,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Once this mission is over, \NI can show you two my treasure."
27862,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Th-This is...
27863,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Goal!
27864,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I am the Speed King.
27865,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,No one can stop me!
27866,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably \Nalready crossed the border."
27867,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Well, I'll take my time searching..."
27868,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"For my own paradise, \Nwith plenty of food and females."
27869,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears..."
27870,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.
27871,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Because I am the Glutton King.
27872,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers have now departed to become kings.
27873,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Meanwhile, the King is now in the Republic of East Gorteau."
27874,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Next time: Date x With x Palm.
27875,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,A date! A date!
27876,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,"Gon, do you understand what a date is?"
27877,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Huh? Sure.
27878,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,It's when a man and woman—
27879,One Wish x And x Two Promises.,92,Th-Th-That's enough!
27880,Date x With x Palm.,93,What? Intruders?
27881,Date x With x Palm.,93,Dispose of them.
27882,Date x With x Palm.,93,I'm busy right now.
27883,Date x With x Palm.,93,Don't bother me with reports \NI don't need to hear!
27884,Date x With x Palm.,93,Carry on now.
27885,Date x With x Palm.,93,Date x With x Palm
27886,Date x With x Palm.,93,I don't know which nation sent you.
27887,Date x With x Palm.,93,"But having entered this palace, you must now die painful deaths."
27888,Date x With x Palm.,93,Your Majesty...
27889,Date x With x Palm.,93,I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.
27890,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is a rare human.
27891,Date x With x Palm.,93,An appetizing treat.
27892,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is it...
27893,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is the flavor I sought!
27894,Date x With x Palm.,93,I feel it.
27895,Date x With x Palm.,93,I feel it! I feel it!
27896,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is it!
27897,Date x With x Palm.,93,I can feel power surging through my body!
27898,Date x With x Palm.,93,I understand...{\i0
27899,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is the King's power.
27900,Date x With x Palm.,93,He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.
27901,Date x With x Palm.,93,"In other words, the more he eats, the stronger he will grow."
27902,Date x With x Palm.,93,Hmm? Who are you people?
27903,Date x With x Palm.,93,Guards!
27904,Date x With x Palm.,93,What are you incompetents doing?
27905,Date x With x Palm.,93,Worthless.
27906,Date x With x Palm.,93,I can't sense anything.
27907,Date x With x Palm.,93,Insolent thugs!
27908,Date x With x Palm.,93,Do you know who I am?
27909,Date x With x Palm.,93,"A supreme leader of this era, a king among kings..."
27910,Date x With x Palm.,93,I am Masador Diego!
27911,Date x With x Palm.,93,Why does that scum claim to be the king?
27912,Date x With x Palm.,93,"In the human world, it is a common phenomenon."
27913,Date x With x Palm.,93,Humans without intelligence or talent end up in positions of power due \Nto bloodline or connections.
27914,Date x With x Palm.,93,That defies all logic...
27915,Date x With x Palm.,93,"In the hands of an incompetent, \Npower brings nothing but ruin."
27916,Date x With x Palm.,93,This could only be the work of imbeciles.
27917,Date x With x Palm.,93,We must provide proper guidance.
27918,Date x With x Palm.,93,Absolutely.
27919,Date x With x Palm.,93,"However, they serve as quality meat, and they are a self-renewing resource."
27920,Date x With x Palm.,93,They are an easy food source.
27921,Date x With x Palm.,93,The non-rare humans can be \Nused to feed our soldiers.
27922,Date x With x Palm.,93,I shall use my godly power \Nto deal divine punishment!
27923,Date x With x Palm.,93,Leave at once—
27924,Date x With x Palm.,93,Allow me to dispose of this.
27925,Date x With x Palm.,93,I can use it to control other humans.
27926,Date x With x Palm.,93,Do as you like.
27927,Date x With x Palm.,93,P-Please!
27928,Date x With x Palm.,93,S-Spare our lives.
27929,Date x With x Palm.,93,We beg you...
27930,Date x With x Palm.,93,These humans are idiots.
27931,Date x With x Palm.,93,Think as hard as those weak \Nbrains of yours can manage.
27932,Date x With x Palm.,93,Have you ever spared a pig or a cow as it begged for its life?
27933,Date x With x Palm.,93,The view is excellent.
27934,Date x With x Palm.,93,And there is plenty of space.
27935,Date x With x Palm.,93,I dub this place the Meat Plantation.
27936,Date x With x Palm.,93,It will be used for processing humans.
27937,Date x With x Palm.,93,As you command.
27938,Date x With x Palm.,93,"After being defeated by Knuckle \Nand Shoot, Gon and Killua return to the inn where Palm waits."
27939,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Before I worry about enemies,"
27940,Date x With x Palm.,93,I have to protect Gon from Palm.
27941,Date x With x Palm.,93,You must take responsibility.
27942,Date x With x Palm.,93,What?!
27943,Date x With x Palm.,93,You promised to take me to NGL...
27944,Date x With x Palm.,93,You said you'd swallow a thousand needles if you broke that promise.
27945,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Uh-huh, I'm sorry."
27946,Date x With x Palm.,93,I don't want an apology...
27947,Date x With x Palm.,93,But there's no point in having you \Nswallow a thousand needles.
27948,Date x With x Palm.,93,Yeah.
27949,Date x With x Palm.,93,So what can I do to make up for it?
27950,Date x With x Palm.,93,Let's see...
27951,Date x With x Palm.,93,You must... do any one thing I say.
27952,Date x With x Palm.,93,Hey!
27953,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Right now, do you know how Gon feels—"
27954,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Okay, I agree!"
27955,Date x With x Palm.,93,Go out with me.
27956,Date x With x Palm.,93,Go out with me...
27957,Date x With x Palm.,93,Eh?
27958,Date x With x Palm.,93,Okay.
27959,Date x With x Palm.,93,Huh?
27960,Date x With x Palm.,93,Do you have any idea what you're doing?!
27961,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything."
27962,Date x With x Palm.,93,And you have no problem \Nplaying dirty like this?!
27963,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is none of your business.
27964,Date x With x Palm.,93,It's our problem.
27965,Date x With x Palm.,93,It's up to the two of us.
27966,Date x With x Palm.,93,"You should stay away from her, Gon."
27967,Date x With x Palm.,93,Don't interrupt us!
27968,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is something the two \Nof us must decide alone.
27969,Date x With x Palm.,93,You just want an excuse to say that!
27970,Date x With x Palm.,93,Just be quiet.
27971,Date x With x Palm.,93,We're going out now...
27972,Date x With x Palm.,93,There's somewhere I really want to go.
27973,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Oh, sorry. I can't go out today."
27974,Date x With x Palm.,93,Eh?
27975,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Today, I have to train with Killua."
27976,Date x With x Palm.,93,I know!
27977,Date x With x Palm.,93,"You can train with us, Palm!"
27978,Date x With x Palm.,93,Huh?
27979,Date x With x Palm.,93,What are you talking about?
27980,Date x With x Palm.,93,Didn't you say we'd go out?
27981,Date x With x Palm.,93,Uh-huh.
27982,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Then, why is he tagging along?"
27983,Date x With x Palm.,93,And why would we train?
27984,Date x With x Palm.,93,Are you toying with me?
27985,Date x With x Palm.,93,This will be a date...
27986,Date x With x Palm.,93,Our first date!
27987,Date x With x Palm.,93,The first date for us!
27988,Date x With x Palm.,93,The! First! Date!
27989,Date x With x Palm.,93,But it isn't a date.
27990,Date x With x Palm.,93,Huh?!
27991,Date x With x Palm.,93,We can have a proper date later.
27992,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Since it's our first date, like you said."
27993,Date x With x Palm.,93,Wow...
27994,Date x With x Palm.,93,"The word ""date"" keeps popping up."
27995,Date x With x Palm.,93,"And I need time to prepare for it, too."
27996,Date x With x Palm.,93,Prepare? Prepare for what?
27997,Date x With x Palm.,93,That's... a secret.
27998,Date x With x Palm.,93,You get to find out tomorrow.
27999,Date x With x Palm.,93,Oh...
28000,Date x With x Palm.,93,"In that case, it's fine."
28001,Date x With x Palm.,93,Really...
28002,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If you'd explained first, \NI wouldn't have been so angry."
28003,Date x With x Palm.,93,Sorry about that.
28004,Date x With x Palm.,93,"But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!"
28005,Date x With x Palm.,93,You wanted to surprise me?
28006,Date x With x Palm.,93,Gosh...
28007,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM, \Nin front of the bulletin board."
28008,Date x With x Palm.,93,I'll be there!
28009,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Gon, you're amazing!"
28010,Date x With x Palm.,93,Huh? What do you mean?
28011,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Well, listening to you talk to Palm, \Nyou seemed used to this stuff."
28012,Date x With x Palm.,93,Really?
28013,Date x With x Palm.,93,I was wondering...
28014,Date x With x Palm.,93,Hmm?
28015,Date x With x Palm.,93,Have you been on a date before?
28016,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Sure, I have."
28017,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Well, most of them were with Mito-san."
28018,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Oh, that makes sense..."
28019,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Wait, who else was there?"
28020,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Oh, some of the fishing boats that stopped at Whale Island were full of women, some of whom only liked younger men..."
28021,Date x With x Palm.,93,So I took them around the village \Nand had them teach me things.
28022,Date x With x Palm.,93,T-Teach him things?
28023,Date x With x Palm.,93,Th-That means...
28024,Date x With x Palm.,93,He's a grown-up!
28025,Date x With x Palm.,93,Women like that were called fanatics.
28026,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?"
28027,Date x With x Palm.,93,No! Of course not...
28028,Date x With x Palm.,93,I spent all my time training as an assassin.
28029,Date x With x Palm.,93,"And ever since I quit, I've been with you."
28030,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Oh, yeah."
28031,Date x With x Palm.,93,Right!
28032,Date x With x Palm.,93,And I really don't want that to change...
28033,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Somewhere down the line, \Nyou'll leave Gon behind to die."
28034,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Damn, I'm about ready to give in..."
28035,Date x With x Palm.,93,And this was my own decision...
28036,Date x With x Palm.,93,Hello?
28037,Date x With x Palm.,93,It's Knuckle.
28038,Date x With x Palm.,93,We've located and secured Kite.
28039,Date x With x Palm.,93,Really? Kite's okay?
28040,Date x With x Palm.,93,Knuckle?
28041,Date x With x Palm.,93,I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.
28042,Date x With x Palm.,93,So I wouldn't say that he's okay.
28043,Date x With x Palm.,93,That's fine.
28044,Date x With x Palm.,93,There must be a way to bring him back!
28045,Date x With x Palm.,93,"All right, it'll take three days to get back, so watch out for any soldier ants."
28046,Date x With x Palm.,93,"It seems they've scattered far \Nand wide, imitating the king."
28047,Date x With x Palm.,93,Got it.
28048,Date x With x Palm.,93,Yes!
28049,Date x With x Palm.,93,I knew that Kite was alive!
28050,Date x With x Palm.,93,That's great.
28051,Date x With x Palm.,93,All that's left is to protect you for a month.
28052,Date x With x Palm.,93,Wow!
28053,Date x With x Palm.,93,Look over here!
28054,Date x With x Palm.,93,I've found a new feeding ground.
28055,Date x With x Palm.,93,There we go.
28056,Date x With x Palm.,93,What's that for?
28057,Date x With x Palm.,93,It's a present for Palm.
28058,Date x With x Palm.,93,Are you sure about this?
28059,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?"
28060,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If I just hand it to her, probably..."
28061,Date x With x Palm.,93,Whatever... Let's get back to town.
28062,Date x With x Palm.,93,Yeah.
28063,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If we encounter soldier ants \Nhere, in the mountains, we'll be in serious trouble."
28064,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of \Nencountering ants looking for humans is high."
28065,Date x With x Palm.,93,"But while other humans are being \Ntargeted, we can escape."
28066,Date x With x Palm.,93,"After all, Gon can't currently use his {\i0"
28067,Date x With x Palm.,93,So I must protect him.
28068,Date x With x Palm.,93,Even if it means sacrificing everything else!
28069,Date x With x Palm.,93,Let's hurry.
28070,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Drop your weapon, place your hands behind your head, and lie down on the ground!"
28071,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If you don't comply within three \Nseconds, we will open fire."
28072,Date x With x Palm.,93,Three...
28073,Date x With x Palm.,93,Two...
28074,Date x With x Palm.,93,One!
28075,Date x With x Palm.,93,Ready...
28076,Date x With x Palm.,93,Fire!
28077,Date x With x Palm.,93,He disappeared?
28078,Date x With x Palm.,93,Ow!
28079,Date x With x Palm.,93,These guys are so slow...
28080,Date x With x Palm.,93,This is no fun.
28081,Date x With x Palm.,93,On to the next story.
28082,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Today, around noon, an unidentified creature killed \Nseven people in Pata City."
28083,Date x With x Palm.,93,"The creature also injured multiple police \Nofficers who had rushed to the scene, before escaping into the Miera Mountains."
28084,Date x With x Palm.,93,"According to police testimony, the creature moved at speeds exceeding \Ntwo hundred kilometers per hour."
28085,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Before leaving, it said, ""I'll return \Ntomorrow. Bring faster humans,"" which means it could be a new \Nspecies of Magical Beast."
28086,Date x With x Palm.,93,An evacuation has been ordered \Nfor all area residents.
28087,Date x With x Palm.,93,Pata City and the Miera Mountains...
28088,Date x With x Palm.,93,NGL                                                                                           Republic of\NAutonomous                                                                                   Rokario \NRegion
28089,Date x With x Palm.,93,Inninge City \N\NMiera Mountains\N\NPata City\N\NQwen City \N\NDory City
28090,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Another city lies between us, with the Miera Mountains on the opposite side."
28091,Date x With x Palm.,93,We should be okay...
28092,Date x With x Palm.,93,"The government has requested that \Nthe Hunter Association capture it, and the Association has accepted."
28093,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Next, we have the weather."
28094,Date x With x Palm.,93,"I'm done, Killua!"
28095,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Tomorrow, we're both on our own."
28096,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym."
28097,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Yeah, right."
28098,Date x With x Palm.,93,I can't ditch Gon when he's \Nessentially defenseless...
28099,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Gon-kun, over here."
28100,Date x With x Palm.,93,Hmm?
28101,Date x With x Palm.,93,I didn't recognize you!
28102,Date x With x Palm.,93,Who are you?!
28103,Date x With x Palm.,93,Do I look strange?
28104,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Nope, you look really pretty!"
28105,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Wait, stop it... You're too loud."
28106,Date x With x Palm.,93,You're embarrassing me...
28107,Date x With x Palm.,93,What? I'm just telling the truth.
28108,Date x With x Palm.,93,That's enough. Let's go.
28109,Date x With x Palm.,93,Quickly.
28110,Date x With x Palm.,93,Damn...
28111,Date x With x Palm.,93,What am I doing?
28112,Date x With x Palm.,93,Now I look like the stalker!
28113,Date x With x Palm.,93,"No, don't let it get to me."
28114,Date x With x Palm.,93,I have to protect Gon!
28115,Date x With x Palm.,93,There's no telling when \Nthe enemy will show up.
28116,Date x With x Palm.,93,How far are they going to go?
28117,Date x With x Palm.,93,Something's there.
28118,Date x With x Palm.,93,This aura is probably from a soldier ant.
28119,Date x With x Palm.,93,"It isn't that close, but it isn't that far, either."
28120,Date x With x Palm.,93,There are faint aura traces around.
28121,Date x With x Palm.,93,Did it already pass through the area?
28122,Date x With x Palm.,93,Or were they brought here by the wind?
28123,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Either way, there's a high \Nrisk our paths will cross!"
28124,Date x With x Palm.,93,Should I warn them?
28125,Date x With x Palm.,93,We're here.
28126,Date x With x Palm.,93,Eh?
28127,Date x With x Palm.,93,It's beautiful...
28128,Date x With x Palm.,93,"No, there's no point in telling them."
28129,Date x With x Palm.,93,Gon can't use his {\i0
28130,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If he gets upset about Kite and flies \Noff the handle with rage, he's finished."
28131,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Knowing Palm, she'll definitely \Ngo nuts if I interrupt her date."
28132,Date x With x Palm.,93,"If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,"
28133,Date x With x Palm.,93,Use this chair. the nearby ants will notice us.
28134,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Thank you, I'm fine."
28135,Date x With x Palm.,93,I can't let them know...
28136,Date x With x Palm.,93,I'll take care of this myself!
28137,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Oh, I thought I smelled a human..."
28138,Date x With x Palm.,93,That's...
28139,Date x With x Palm.,93,I remember you.
28140,Date x With x Palm.,93,You're one of those kids from before!
28141,Date x With x Palm.,93,Looks like your luck's run out.
28142,Date x With x Palm.,93,You're about to get a taste of hell.
28143,Date x With x Palm.,93,But it won't last forever.
28144,Date x With x Palm.,93,I moved upwind to catch his attention and draw him away from them.
28145,Date x With x Palm.,93,I've done what I had to.
28146,Date x With x Palm.,93,But...
28147,Date x With x Palm.,93,Where's the other kid?
28148,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Once you tell me his location, \NI'll give you an easy death."
28149,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Well, he can't be that far away..."
28150,Date x With x Palm.,93,"He's your buddy, right?"
28151,Date x With x Palm.,93,"Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not."
28152,Date x With x Palm.,93,I'll just walk around making lots of noise \Nand swinging your severed head.
28153,Date x With x Palm.,93,Then he'll come to me himself.
28154,Date x With x Palm.,93,Isn't that how humans are?
28155,Date x With x Palm.,93,He's right.
28156,Date x With x Palm.,93,"I have to defeat him, or it's all over!"
28157,Date x With x Palm.,93,I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
28158,Date x With x Palm.,93,Next time: Friend x And x Journey.
28159,Date x With x Palm.,93,Going back to Whale Island with Killua...
28160,Date x With x Palm.,93,Looking up at the stars with Gon.
28161,Date x With x Palm.,93,We're going on a journey!
28162,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"I have to defeat him, or it's all over!"
28163,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
28164,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Friend x And x Journey
28165,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Determined to protect Gon
28166,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Nen{\i0
28167,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.
28168,Friend x And x Journey.,94,However...
28169,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28170,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Yes! That's more like it!
28171,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That terrified expression...
28172,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I love it!
28173,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Damn, I'm getting excited now..."
28174,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm gonna tear you apart.
28175,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"If you aren't certain you can win, run."
28176,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I have to protect him... I have to...
28177,Friend x And x Journey.,94,When you know nothing of your opponent...
28178,Friend x And x Journey.,94,...protect Gon.
28179,Friend x And x Journey.,94,...run away.
28180,Friend x And x Journey.,94,No matter what!
28181,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Is there something special about that tree?
28182,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Just wait a little longer.
28183,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Amazing...
28184,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They're seaside fireflies.
28185,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"They're only found around brackish water, and this is their breeding season."
28186,Friend x And x Journey.,94,It's beautiful!
28187,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Isn't it?
28188,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You piss yourself or something?
28189,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Well?!
28190,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Can't even move a muscle?
28191,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Lose your spine?
28192,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Damn, this feels so good..."
28193,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Should I kill him?
28194,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Ah, but I want to enjoy this!"
28195,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Here.
28196,Friend x And x Journey.,94,It's a present.
28197,Friend x And x Journey.,94,This is the most beautiful flower in the world.
28198,Friend x And x Journey.,94,It is?
28199,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Stay still.
28200,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"The tree's sap is very similar to \Nthe pheromones fireflies emit, so they tend to gather around branches."
28201,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm so happy...
28202,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Thank you.
28203,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Really?
28204,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm glad to hear that.
28205,Friend x And x Journey.,94,But I...
28206,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I can't give you what you truly want.
28207,Friend x And x Journey.,94,What I truly want?
28208,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Time alone with me.
28209,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Eh?
28210,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I...
28211,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I want to become stronger.
28212,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.
28213,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That means I have to train harder.
28214,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"In two days, Kite's coming back."
28215,Friend x And x Journey.,94,But it sounds like he's under enemy control.
28216,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"To return him to normal, I'll probably \Nhave to fight whoever is controlling him."
28217,Friend x And x Journey.,94,So until Kite is back to normal...
28218,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Or if possible, until the \NChimera Ants are defeated..."
28219,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I want to focus on my training.
28220,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Yes... Yes!
28221,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Are you okay with that?
28222,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh?
28223,Friend x And x Journey.,94,What was that?
28224,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Damn! I can't get enough!
28225,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run...
28226,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Hurry.
28227,Friend x And x Journey.,94,No...
28228,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Gon!
28229,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I will...
28230,Friend x And x Journey.,94,...protect you.
28231,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Because we're friends...
28232,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You're my dear friend!
28233,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Stop that...
28234,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Don't look at me like that.
28235,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I c-can't stop myself...
28236,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll kill you.
28237,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll kill you! I'll kill you...
28238,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28239,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Shut up!
28240,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28241,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I won't listen to you!
28242,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run... Run... Run...
28243,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Shut up!
28244,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!"
28245,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28246,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I don't want to lose him!
28247,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28248,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Gon is...
28249,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28250,Friend x And x Journey.,94,...my...
28251,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28252,Friend x And x Journey.,94,...dear...
28253,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Run.
28254,Friend x And x Journey.,94,It has to be Killua.
28255,Friend x And x Journey.,94,My very dear friend!
28256,Friend x And x Journey.,94,He disappeared?
28257,Friend x And x Journey.,94,He fooled me good.
28258,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Illumi must have planted this inside my head.
28259,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh? What are you talking about?
28260,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Have you lost your mind?
28261,Friend x And x Journey.,94,And how did you dodge that?
28262,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Wait, I saw the whole thing."
28263,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Right before I reached him, he jammed his finger into his own head."
28264,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"And then he vanished, before popping up over there."
28265,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Yeah, I feel so much better now."
28266,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm completely awake now.
28267,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.
28268,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That's all that happened! Nothing more...
28269,Friend x And x Journey.,94,This can't be happening!
28270,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Now I'm the one who's afraid?!
28271,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I have a message for the other Ants.
28272,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"If you come anywhere near us, your lives are over."
28273,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That's bull!
28274,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Very well.
28275,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Then don't bother.
28276,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They're gone.
28277,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Their stuff's still here...
28278,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Were other Ants nearby?
28279,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I don't sense any.
28280,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That means...
28281,Friend x And x Journey.,94,What are you doing?!
28282,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Eh? Can't you tell?
28283,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm punishing him.
28284,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Punishing him for toying with my feelings!
28285,Friend x And x Journey.,94,What the hell?
28286,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You're the one who's being unreasonable!
28287,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Well, at least he's okay..."
28288,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Leave us alone! \NThis is none of your business!
28289,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Right back at you, stupid."
28290,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Why don't you make yourself scarce?
28291,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Why are you injured?
28292,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh?
28293,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?"
28294,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll injure you some more!
28295,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Palm...
28296,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Don't bother.
28297,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I could dodge your knife in my sleep.
28298,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I was so sure he was dead...
28299,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Wait!
28300,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll kill you!
28301,Friend x And x Journey.,94,What?
28302,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Catch us if you can, stupid!"
28303,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Wait!
28304,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Stop, Killua..."
28305,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You're just making her angrier.
28306,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh?
28307,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again."
28308,Friend x And x Journey.,94,We just have to call Knuckle and tell \Nhim we'll meet him somewhere else.
28309,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'm going back.
28310,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Do you want to die?
28311,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"If you let your guard down, thinking she's not much of a fighter, \Nshe'll stab you in the back!"
28312,Friend x And x Journey.,94,She wouldn't do that.
28313,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh?!
28314,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?
28315,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Damn, you're too much!"
28316,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They're making a fool of me!
28317,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They think they've escaped me?
28318,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Fools!
28319,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Wherever you run to, I will know!"
28320,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Cute, cute mermaid..."
28321,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Where is that accursed brat, Killua?"
28322,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"There he is, the fool!"
28323,Friend x And x Journey.,94,The hotel by the station...
28324,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Brat...
28325,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Brat! Brat! Brat!
28326,Friend x And x Journey.,94,He keeps interfering!
28327,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"If not for him, everything would be fine."
28328,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I'll chase him to the end of \Nthe world and eliminate him!
28329,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Make a fool of me, will you?!"
28330,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Kno—
28331,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Knov-sama...
28332,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Where did those boys go?
28333,Friend x And x Journey.,94,R-Right...
28334,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They went to the hotel that \Nhas a logo with three circles.
28335,Friend x And x Journey.,94,This is Knov.
28336,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.
28337,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Yeah, we just got a call from them."
28338,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Um, I believe you had planned \Nto arrive in two days..."
28339,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"No, we're on schedule."
28340,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"We'll use the extra two days \Nto observe those boys, to determine if they're ready to \Nsee Kite in his current state."
28341,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"But first things first, Palm!"
28342,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Y-Yes?
28343,Friend x And x Journey.,94,It appears that you used your \Npower without my permission.
28344,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"I told you to await my orders, \Nin case of unforeseen events."
28345,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Yes...
28346,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.
28347,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Irreplaceable?
28348,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Use it only for me.
28349,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Only for Knov-sama...
28350,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Understood?
28351,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Y-Yes.
28352,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Knov-sama really is the only one for me!
28353,Friend x And x Journey.,94,And why are you dressed like that?
28354,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Oh! No reason...
28355,Friend x And x Journey.,94,N-Nothing's going on!
28356,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Irreplaceable...
28357,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Then tell her to wait until \NKite's back to normal.
28358,Friend x And x Journey.,94,I did.
28359,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B, forced into a relationship by Palm \NSiberia, age 22, blood type A... and dumped before he knew it."
28360,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Meh... Again?
28361,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That's the third one.
28362,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Oh! A secret one!
28363,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Huh? Really?
28364,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Yeah, you can auction it on \Nthe net for a lot of money."
28365,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Then you can have it.
28366,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Not interested.
28367,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Did something happen?
28368,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Hmm? Not really.
28369,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Let's hit the gym.
28370,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Okay!
28371,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Well?
28372,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"Oh, I haven't noticed anything."
28373,Friend x And x Journey.,94,They seem to be doing fine...
28374,Friend x And x Journey.,94,But we should continue to observe them.
28375,Friend x And x Journey.,94,That will give them time to \Nconclude their business.
28376,Friend x And x Journey.,94,While Knov and Shoot were observing \Nthe mental state of Gon and Killua...
28377,Friend x And x Journey.,94,He's here.
28378,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Who's this guy?
28379,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Not bad.
28380,Friend x And x Journey.,94,He's fast.
28381,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You're faster than the guys \NI fought yesterday.
28382,Friend x And x Journey.,94,But not by much.
28383,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.
28384,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Give me more meat!
28385,Friend x And x Journey.,94,You eat a lot.
28386,Friend x And x Journey.,94,Bitter much?
28387,Friend x And x Journey.,94,"You mean, ""Jealous much?"""
28388,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Looks like you guys have been \Nwaiting here to kill me.
28389,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Sorry, but the prey is about \Nto become the predator."
28390,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You'll die before you can even strike back.
28391,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Really?
28392,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I barely felt a thing.
28393,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You could punch us like that a few \Nthousand times without killing us.
28394,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I get it.
28395,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You're trying to act tough.
28396,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You're swinging long after the ball's \Nalready in the catcher's mitt.
28397,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Just as a warning, I'm not \Nusing my full strength."
28398,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I can run faster and throw harder punches.
28399,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,This is a surprise.
28400,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He's actually aiming for my face.
28401,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I was certain his eyes couldn't \Neven follow my motion earlier...
28402,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Just a lucky guess?
28403,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Him, too..."
28404,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He's clearly ascertaining where \NI'm going to be before he attacks.
28405,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's only been a minute since I encountered them.
28406,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,They've adapted to my speed that quickly?
28407,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.
28408,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,How amusing...
28409,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It makes this more of a challenge!
28410,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Grudge x And x Dread
28411,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...
28412,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You obviously can't compete physically.
28413,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,How are you gonna compensate?
28414,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,With guns? Numbers?
28415,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We'll use wit and experience.
28416,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Where did this stuff come from?
28417,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Smoke? Gas?
28418,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Poison gas?
28419,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Or sleeping gas?
28420,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"No, they're standing within it."
28421,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,This must be some kind of special power.
28422,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Are you scared?
28423,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You can retreat if you want.
28424,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Does that mean you aren't running away?
28425,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Then this is a smokescreen.
28426,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,They'll use it as cover for their attack.
28427,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Well, let's see what they can do..."
28428,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Here it comes!
28429,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What?
28430,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Gyo{\i0
28431,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,This trick won't work on the same \Nopponent too many times.
28432,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But it only needs to once.
28433,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I wouldn't be so sure.
28434,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,That didn't hurt at all.
28435,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"I'll admit that you caught me off-guard, but you didn't do any damage."
28436,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What's this?
28437,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Gee, I wonder..."
28438,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's time.
28439,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Adding interest.
28440,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Answer me.
28441,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Answer me!
28442,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Your anger is blinding you \Nto your surroundings...
28443,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.
28444,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Hey! Damn it!
28445,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,They're gone?
28446,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Where are you?
28447,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's time.
28448,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Adding interest.
28449,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It doesn't matter what your power does.
28450,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I just have to rip you apart!
28451,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Zetsu{\i0
28452,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Well, we're dealing with \Na level-one soldier ant."
28453,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"With APR on him, we can easily track him."
28454,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"We just need to chase him down, \N box him in, and that'll be the end."
28455,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But doesn't your ability lose its effect \Nif the target moves too far away?
28456,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"It'll stop adding interest, but the effect will remain."
28457,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Once I'm back in range, \Nthe counter will start up again."
28458,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"But even if IRS doesn't kick in, \Nhe'll be easy to finish off."
28459,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We've already learned his attacks.
28460,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You fool!
28461,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"We may know what pitch he'll use, but we still can't put the bat on the ball."
28462,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28463,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You're right.
28464,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...
28465,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Damn...
28466,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I can't shake this thing.
28467,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I can't outrun it...
28468,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,So this is {\i0
28469,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I need more than just speed here.
28470,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite's in here.
28471,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He is no longer the person you once knew.
28472,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's okay.
28473,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We'll find a way to cure him!
28474,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Hotel Rafflesia...
28475,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Hotel Rafflesia: \N{\3c&H61AE6E&
28476,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Once I've dealt an enemy a \Ncertain amount of damage,"
28477,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I'm able to trap an entire body or merely a single part inside.
28478,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,This must be how he took my eye.
28479,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If I release him from the cage, \Nhe'll return to his original size."
28480,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Be careful.
28481,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28482,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite...
28483,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Most likely, they used him to train soldiers."
28484,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He automatically attacks \Nanyone who approaches.
28485,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite...
28486,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's okay now.
28487,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's okay.
28488,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's been a while... since you punched me.
28489,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,That hurt a lot...
28490,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You're going to let this beating continue?
28491,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28492,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"It's okay, Gon will notice."
28493,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Maybe he already has, and is still..."
28494,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Perhaps.
28495,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block, allowing himself to be hit."
28496,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,For real?
28497,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite's attacks may be robotic \Nand easy to anticipate.
28498,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt \Nso quickly in his current state!
28499,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.
28500,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,This is the reality we've created \Nthat we must now face.
28501,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He'll go right next.
28502,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Right again.
28503,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,And then left.
28504,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Then a feint...
28505,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He really does fight like a robot.
28506,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite isn't this weak...
28507,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite's punches hurt much more!
28508,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"I'm sorry, Kite."
28509,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It's our fault you're like this...
28510,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Get some rest.
28511,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We'll take it from here.
28512,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Level two...
28513,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Gon can't see that thing, but it activates when anyone touches Kite."
28514,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You must be highly skilled at \Ncombat to clear this test.
28515,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0 so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.
28516,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Be careful.
28517,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If you touch him again, he'll attack."
28518,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What do I do?
28519,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,How did you stop him?
28520,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We injured him badly.
28521,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"We had no choice, but I'm still sorry."
28522,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If you stay away, he won't attack."
28523,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Kite...
28524,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Just wait a little longer.
28525,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I'll get you back to normal soon.
28526,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Killua...
28527,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I want that one myself!
28528,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Killua...
28529,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I knew something was different when I saw you.
28530,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What did you guys do in the \Nshort time since I saw you last?
28531,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We didn't do anything.
28532,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Our enemies did.
28533,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,A Few Weeks Later
28534,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28535,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Are you sure we should let them come along?
28536,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.
28537,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I see no problem with that.
28538,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,The test was to determine \Nwho would enter NGL...
28539,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,And we are headed to the \NRepublic of East Gorteau.
28540,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Sounds like a technicality to me.
28541,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?
28542,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"No, they're grown tigers now."
28543,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,They can take care of themselves.
28544,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"I would agree that Killua is capable, but what about Gon?"
28545,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"At the very end, I was impressed \Nby the way he moved."
28546,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But he hasn't shown any fire since.
28547,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,And he clearly isn't focused during training.
28548,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.
28549,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But he's consistently inconsistent.
28550,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He only gets serious when he absolutely must.
28551,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I think his lack of drive these past few \Nweeks will actually give him a boost.
28552,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,A boost?
28553,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He's been saving up all that energy...
28554,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,To unleash when he finds his hated foe.
28555,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Well, we'll see soon enough."
28556,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28557,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,And the enemy is before us!
28558,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border
28559,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What is the agenda behind \Nthe sudden flurry of activity recently observed in East Gorteau?
28560,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited all citizens to gather in the capital city,"
28561,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Peijing, to celebrate the \Nnation's birth in ten days."
28562,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Yes, there have been occasions \Nin the past during which all citizens were invited to participate."
28563,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"However, we've never seen \Nanything on this scale, where practically every citizen, from babies to the ill, has been summoned \Nfor a celebration spanning three days."
28564,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,The logical conclusion would be that \Nthe goal this time is different.
28565,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What do you believe the goal to be?
28566,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Well, it would send a powerful message if he were to announce his successor \Nand abdication simultaneously."
28567,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme \NLeader relinquishing his power.
28568,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It may also be meant to distract \Nfrom some other matter.
28569,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"In any event, the whole world will be \Nwatching East Gorteau in ten days."
28570,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Next...
28571,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Colt believes the celebration \Nwill be used as a screening.
28572,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0 but ninety-nine percent of \Nthe humans there will die.
28573,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We must stop it before that happens!
28574,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Our time limit is ten days.
28575,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,What's the old man up to?
28576,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"He sent an e-mail saying that he's \Nalready inside East Gorteau, but I haven't heard from him since."
28577,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Do you think he's been taken out?
28578,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If he fails to contact us today, we've been told to assume as much."
28579,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman."
28580,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,That old man's got some sharp ears...
28581,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He already knows everything.
28582,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Including the fact that you boys are here.
28583,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.
28584,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Divide into three pairs and draw the \NRoyal Guard away from the King.
28585,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"The night before the celebration, \Nthe operation will begin at midnight."
28586,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,From the sharp-eared old man.
28587,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,That guy really scares me...
28588,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.
28589,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,So I'll make myself scarce!
28590,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,See you around...
28591,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Bye!
28592,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Nen{\i0
28593,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Give it a try.
28594,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Gon...
28595,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Sorry, but I'm still not convinced \Nwe should keep you around."
28596,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Show me your resolve.
28597,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.
28598,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If your attack is too weak, we'll replace \Nyou with another Hunter."
28599,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Seriously, the master can be so difficult."
28600,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,He already agreed to bring Gon along...
28601,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Gon, show him your Jajanken."
28602,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You want me to attack you for real?
28603,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Don't insult me!
28604,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"If you hold back in the slightest, \Nyou're off the team!"
28605,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Got it.
28606,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,First comes rock...
28607,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Gon, that's enough..."
28608,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Right, big guy?"
28609,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Y-Yeah...
28610,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Oh.
28611,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"K-Killua, thank you."
28612,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Sorry about that, Morel-san!"
28613,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,I was really about to kill you!
28614,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You got me... You got me good.
28615,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,You go crazy with the best of them.
28616,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,We'll split up now.
28617,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Use whatever means you deem \Nbest to fulfill your mission.
28618,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Gon and Killua, as you requested, \Nyou're assigned to Neferpitou."
28619,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,"Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the \None called Menthuthuyoupi."
28620,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.
28621,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Best of luck to you.
28622,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,The preparations for the final \Nbattles are complete.
28623,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Ten days remain until that moment.
28624,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Next time: A x Lawless x Home.
28625,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Wanna see what being controlled is like?
28626,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Huh?
28627,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Stick this antenna here...
28628,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,Huh?
28629,Grudge x And x Dread.,95,It has to be Killua.
28630,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Next is the continuation of \Nour report on the UMAs, or Unidentified Mysterious Animals, \Nthat have recently been sighted."
28631,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"The difference between this and our previous \Nreport is the increasing number of victims, and the amount of evidence supporting \Nthe existence of these creatures."
28632,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"In any case, many of the witnesses are \Nactive members of the police force."
28633,A x Lawless x Home.,96,And over half of the officers who have rushed to the scenes have \Nbeen killed by these creatures.
28634,A x Lawless x Home.,96,These are images of unidentified creatures \Nthat have been attacking the police.
28635,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You can see the victims on the \Nground at the creatures' feet.
28636,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"What we know is that all these creatures \Nare violent, capable of speech, and show no fear of humans."
28637,A x Lawless x Home.,96,A prime example is this interview \Nwith the lion man of Nevaska.
28638,A x Lawless x Home.,96,He spoke at length of a crude theory \Nabout the existence of a kingdom.
28639,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"The woman interviewing him listened \Npatiently to what he had to say, but eventually, she asked the \Nquestion on every viewer's mind."
28640,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Can you prove that you \Ntruly are what you claim?
28641,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Those were her last words.
28642,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"So far, the unidentified creatures have only appeared on the Yorbian continent."
28643,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"But it seems likely that they \Nwill continue to spread, and no effective method of dealing \Nwith them has been found."
28644,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Sorry for the wait.
28645,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Okay, let's go."
28646,A x Lawless x Home.,96,A x Lawless x Home
28647,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They're known as Chimera Ants.
28648,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I know.
28649,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They became that way after mixing with humans.
28650,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Working backwards from the dates and \Nlocations of sightings and police reports, they probably originated in the Balsa Islands."
28651,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Lots of strange nations are in that area.
28652,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You shouldn't be talking about \Nhow strange other people are.
28653,A x Lawless x Home.,96,But they were once ants...
28654,A x Lawless x Home.,96,So they should just stay close to their nest.
28655,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Why come all the way out here?
28656,A x Lawless x Home.,96,No idea.
28657,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Maybe they were just wandering, or perhaps \Nthey were drawn to the smell of garbage."
28658,A x Lawless x Home.,96,It can't be a coincidence.
28659,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Both NGL and East Gorteau are nations that share no information with the outside world.
28660,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Just like this place.
28661,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That makes it easier for them to invade.
28662,A x Lawless x Home.,96,It's been quite a long time.
28663,A x Lawless x Home.,96,The place hasn't changed...
28664,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's the situation?
28665,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Between the victims and martyrs, \Nwe're seeing over three hundred dead."
28666,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Bombs have no effect, so we can't fight back."
28667,A x Lawless x Home.,96,The council is still arguing about \Nhow to classify the dead.
28668,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What do you mean?
28669,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"A few days ago, this was an ordinary human."
28670,A x Lawless x Home.,96,The Ants did this?
28671,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Looks dead to me.
28672,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's the problem?
28673,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Some are alive and working with the Ants.
28674,A x Lawless x Home.,96,And all of them look like monsters.
28675,A x Lawless x Home.,96,The council's debate is whether \Nto declare them dead based on whether or not there's a way to \Nrestore them to their original forms.
28676,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They can't avenge them because they're too busy arguing over \Nwhether they're dead or mutated?
28677,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Nothing's changed.
28678,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They always lose sight of what's important.
28679,A x Lawless x Home.,96,We're going to do things our way.
28680,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If anyone interferes, we'll take them down."
28681,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Don't worry.
28682,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Before the day is out, we'll exterminate this so-called Queen."
28683,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I am the Queen.
28684,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I repeat.
28685,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Surrender.
28686,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Those who resist will be executed.
28687,A x Lawless x Home.,96,The chosen will live in paradise for eternity!
28688,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Our mother's greatest flaw was that she could only produce soldiers through the archaic and inefficient laying of eggs.
28689,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Her sole achievement was giving birth to me.
28690,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Stop...
28691,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Kill me!
28692,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Kill me!
28693,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Plenty of spirit...
28694,A x Lawless x Home.,96,He shows promise.
28695,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Bingo.
28696,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Chosen one, welcome to paradise."
28697,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Swear eternal fealty to the Queen.
28698,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I am the Queen.
28699,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Sexy Stinger of Rebirth
28700,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"With my Queen Shot, I shall control the world."
28701,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Let's go through the front door.
28702,A x Lawless x Home.,96,No objection here...
28703,A x Lawless x Home.,96,No one's around.
28704,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Are they inviting us in?
28705,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Then I'll go this way.
28706,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'll take this way.
28707,A x Lawless x Home.,96,We're splitting up?
28708,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Of course... It's a race to see \Nwho'll kill the Queen.
28709,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I imagine you'd prefer to hide \Nyour abilities from us.
28710,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Kill anything that attacks you.
28711,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If you kill the Queen, you're the interim boss."
28712,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Understood.
28713,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Start!
28714,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They've scattered.
28715,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"From their footsteps, I can sense \Nthat these intruders are special."
28716,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They are accustomed to living in the wild.
28717,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Are they strong?
28718,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Yes.
28719,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Then go and greet them.
28720,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"But then, no one will be here to guard you."
28721,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If you're worried about me, capture the enemy and hurry back."
28722,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"I have faith in you, Pike."
28723,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Y-You are too kind...
28724,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I will serve you with my life!
28725,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Off I go!
28726,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Now, then..."
28727,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You're heading out?
28728,A x Lawless x Home.,96,My mother's greatest misfortune was that she never experienced \Nthe joy of combat.
28729,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You're no fun...
28730,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Let me hold you.
28731,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'll send you to heaven.
28732,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Moles.
28733,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"No, holes?"
28734,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Bonolenov descended from a small tribe \Nthat industrialization had driven out of its ancestral lands, the Gyudondond."
28735,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"When Gyudondond males reach the age of three, needles are used to puncture holes in their body."
28736,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Depending on the holes' size and shape, and the movements the Gyudondond \Nmake, they can produce sound."
28737,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Before fighting rival tribes or wild animals, they would play a battle song using \Ntheir own bodies as instruments."
28738,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"They are known as the Bapu, dancing warriors."
28739,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Bapu \NDancing Warriors
28740,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"They believe the more beautiful the sound produced, the stronger \Nthe spirit that descends."
28741,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"The most skilled Bapu are treated as gods, and hold more influence than the elders."
28742,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Transform this melody into strength to fight!
28743,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Battle Cantabile
28744,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Battle Cantabile...
28745,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Prologue
28746,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Prologue!
28747,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"The blood of my tribe, the most beautiful in battle, \Nflows through my veins."
28748,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I swear on the names of the spirits and my tribe that you will not best me.
28749,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Was that attack supposed \Nto hold your tribe's pride?
28750,A x Lawless x Home.,96,If so...
28751,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You must not feel much pride.
28752,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Don't bother recanting those words.
28753,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They are but a beast's ramblings.
28754,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They cannot affect me!
28755,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"In a one-on-one fight, my opponent's \Nstrength doesn't matter."
28756,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If I can pierce it with this, I'll win."
28757,A x Lawless x Home.,96,But I'm not certain I can pierce that...
28758,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Those are sharp...
28759,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'll need to slip in between them and insert the antenna into the joint \Nexposed when he moves the arm.
28760,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Chance of succeeding unscathed...
28761,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Twenty percent!
28762,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Okay, it worked..."
28763,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Ow.
28764,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Guess escaping unharmed wasn't possible.
28765,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Huh?
28766,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Why didn't it work?
28767,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I put the antenna in...
28768,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You must be a Manipulator.
28769,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"I can tell because, once you placed \Nthat antenna in Pell, you relaxed."
28770,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That must be the condition \Nfor activating your power.
28771,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You let your guard down \Nwhen you thought it worked.
28772,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Its name is Pell?
28773,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You must also be a Manipulator.
28774,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If my power doesn't activate after \Nthe condition has been met,"
28775,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Nen{\i0
28776,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"That, and he has a remote controller."
28777,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Oh, you knew?"
28778,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Yes, it's first come, first served for Manipulators."
28779,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Once I take you to the Queen, my job is done."
28780,A x Lawless x Home.,96,No good...
28781,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I can't break free.
28782,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Guess there's no choice.
28783,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'd rather not have to use this...
28784,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Your punch stings about as \Nmuch as a mosquito bite.
28785,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's next?
28786,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You gonna kick me?
28787,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Pull out a weapon?
28788,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"As a gift to you on your way to the afterlife, \NI'll grant you one more attack."
28789,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"For an ant, you know some big words."
28790,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Then I'll take you up on that...
28791,A x Lawless x Home.,96,And go with a punch.
28792,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You're sure? Really?
28793,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Fifteen should do it.
28794,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Fifteen?
28795,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Four, five, six..."
28796,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen..."
28797,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Fifteen!
28798,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Huh?
28799,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"I get a free attack, right?"
28800,A x Lawless x Home.,96,W-Wait!
28801,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Karmic Loop
28802,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Every time I wind my arm, my punch gets stronger."
28803,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Ripper Cyclotron!
28804,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Ripper Cyclotron
28805,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Oh, half of that would have been enough."
28806,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I never seem to know how much power to use.
28807,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Now, then..."
28808,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Which way to go?
28809,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Right?
28810,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Or left?
28811,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'll flip a coin.
28812,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's going to happen to me?
28813,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You'll become a slave.
28814,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You'll work for the Queen until you die.
28815,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Not too different from your current life.
28816,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"That's true, in a sense."
28817,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'd just be taking orders from a different person.
28818,A x Lawless x Home.,96,But I'd rather die than listen \Nto someone I don't even like.
28819,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Strong words.
28820,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Well, at this point, all you \Ncan move is your mouth."
28821,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I can move both hands and my left leg.
28822,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That's nice.
28823,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Anyway, ready for me to take control?"
28824,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I can't let you die.
28825,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Once I put this in you...
28826,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"When I fight, I always carry two antennae."
28827,A x Lawless x Home.,96,For just this kind of situation.
28828,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"First come, first served."
28829,A x Lawless x Home.,96,He stuck it in himself!
28830,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Autopilot on.
28831,A x Lawless x Home.,96,S-So much aura...
28832,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Enemy identified.
28833,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Eliminating now.
28834,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Go, Pell!"
28835,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Aim for his leg! Remove the antenna!
28836,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Mission complete.
28837,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Autopilot disengaging.
28838,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Powering off.
28839,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Ow...
28840,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I already feel it...
28841,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'll be down with muscle aches \Nfor two or three days.
28842,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That's why I hate using this!
28843,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"It makes me stronger, but there's a hefty price."
28844,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"And I remember nothing that happened, so I don't feel like I've accomplished anything."
28845,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You have considerable power for a lady.
28846,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Where was she hiding that vacuum cleaner?
28847,A x Lawless x Home.,96,His thread is strong.
28848,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If I get caught in it, I won't be able to escape."
28849,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Where's the Queen?
28850,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Rejoice.
28851,A x Lawless x Home.,96,She stands before you now.
28852,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That's a lame joke.
28853,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Huh? A joke?
28854,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"You have no manners, brat.\NThis warrants a hefty punishment."
28855,A x Lawless x Home.,96,They are but a beast's ramblings.
28856,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Then I'll take you up on that.
28857,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"When I fight, I always carry two antennae."
28858,A x Lawless x Home.,96,It sounds like Feitan found the Queen...
28859,A x Lawless x Home.,96,How do I kill her first?
28860,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's this? A child?
28861,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Hey, little girl, come over here."
28862,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I refuse.
28863,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Rejected...
28864,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Then I'll come to you.
28865,A x Lawless x Home.,96,I'm in a hurry right now.
28866,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's that?
28867,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Confetti.
28868,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Wind!
28869,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That didn't even tickle.
28870,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Surrounding me with more paper?
28871,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You're wasting your time!
28872,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Look.
28873,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What? You think that means something?
28874,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You really are a stupid kid!
28875,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Impossible...
28876,A x Lawless x Home.,96,This rope is made of steel!
28877,A x Lawless x Home.,96,My fan is made of paper.
28878,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Meandering Dance
28879,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Meandering Dance.
28880,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Look.
28881,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Your right arm is next.
28882,A x Lawless x Home.,96,An umbrella?
28883,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Decent reaction.
28884,A x Lawless x Home.,96,A hidden blade?
28885,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"You like hiding things on you, little boy?"
28886,A x Lawless x Home.,96,As do you.
28887,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"When an opponent wears baggy clothing, it's safe to assume they're hiding something."
28888,A x Lawless x Home.,96,What's wrong?
28889,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Are you not going to continue your attack?
28890,A x Lawless x Home.,96,That is the only way to stop my performance.
28891,A x Lawless x Home.,96,You'll pay for this!
28892,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Pike...
28893,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"If I get Pike to use his thread \Nto tangle up this guy, he can't make any sound!"
28894,A x Lawless x Home.,96,"Next time, I'll rip you apart!"
28895,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Your escape is certainly fast...
28896,A x Lawless x Home.,96,But not as fast as the speed of sound.
28897,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Battle Cantabile...
28898,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Jupiter
28899,A x Lawless x Home.,96,Jupiter!

28909,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,They can't avenge them because they're too busy arguing over \Nwhether they're dead or mutated?
28910,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Nothing's changed.

28920,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Where's everyone else?
28921,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Beats me... \NMaybe still playing around?
28922,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Rather than obliterating my opponent, \NI should have enjoyed myself..."
28923,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,That took longer than expected...
28924,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I should break my habit of beating my targets to a pulp.
28925,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You're no match for me!
28926,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Come back when you're stronger.
28927,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Fair point.
28928,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"My, you took that well."
28929,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Looks like I've lost my touch.
28930,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.
28931,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'm stuck on defense...
28932,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"He's fast, and has twice as many limbs."

28940,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"This girl is good, but I can't let her get away."
28941,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,This technique is a literal pain in the ass.

28945,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Uh-oh, there may be no way out of this one..."
28946,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"If I keep the webs coming, you can't escape..."
28947,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Lucky me!
28948,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Caught you!
28949,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,It's no use...
28950,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Even Bihorn-sama, strongest among us, \Ncouldn't snap these webs."
28951,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Now, then..."
28952,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.
28953,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Will Zazan-sama praise me?
28954,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,It got lighter?
28955,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Impossible—
28956,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How?!
28957,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How did she escape?
28958,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Huh?
28959,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I get it...
28960,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You ditched your clothes.
28961,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I understand.
28962,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"She widened an opening in my web to \Nslip through, while protecting her skin."
28963,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"With her power, it's feasible."
28964,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...
28965,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"But after escaping, she can make it \Ndisappear and call it to her again."
28966,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,However!
28967,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Now that you've removed your clothes, \Nyou can't use the same trick again!"
28968,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,The same applies to you.
28969,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I've learned the range and speed of your webs.
28970,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,And I won't mention that his anus \Ntwitches twice before he fires.
28971,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You won't catch me again. \NI'll keep my distance.
28972,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Blinky and I have won.
28973,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Won?
28974,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Such a stupid girl...
28975,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You can't do anything while running away.
28976,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"I said that I'll keep my distance, but I didn't say anything about running."
28977,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'll show you the difference.
28978,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Blinky...
28979,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Suck every last drop of blood from his body.
28980,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,What... Wh-Wh-What?
28981,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Stop it!
28982,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,H-Hey...
28983,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Y-You little...
28984,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Weakling!
28985,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Uh-oh, this is bad..."
28986,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'm getting dizzy.
28987,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I have to stop the blood loss!
28988,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,(How's that?)
28989,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,(Now you can't suck my blood...)
28990,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,There's more?
28991,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,From here?
28992,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,And here?
28993,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I... I can't block everywhere!
28994,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.
28995,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Based on currently available information, it's impossible for you to cover \Neach wound with your eight limbs..."
28996,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Not without another ace in the hole.
28997,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,All cleaned up.
28998,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Huh?
28999,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Hmm...
29000,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Ah, you know those webs \Nyou were shooting out?"
29001,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"By covering your body with them, \Ncouldn't you have stopped the bleeding?"
29002,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,We're both pretty stupid...
29003,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,What is this?
29004,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How can they move so fast?
29005,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Looks like he's moving a little better now.
29006,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He has a ways to go before \Nhe's back to full strength.
29007,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"They were already here, enjoying the show."
29008,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"I wasted some time fooling around, \Nbut I was by no means slow..."
29009,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Five?
29010,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"No, seven?"
29011,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How many feints was that?
29012,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,And how can he leap from \Nthat position while attacki—
29013,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Ah! He's already over there!
29014,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I can't believe it...
29015,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He's on a completely \Ndifferent level.
29016,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Whoa, everyone's already here?"
29017,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Going for a new look?
29018,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I got caught in my opponent's webs.
29019,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Wait, you actually lost—"
29020,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I won.
29021,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,She's really mad!
29022,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Feitan's the only one left.
29023,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,His opponent's pretty strong.
29024,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,It's probably the Queen.
29025,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,But Feitan looks sluggish.
29026,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He isn't back to full strength yet...
29027,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,We know! You already said that!
29028,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'm still too weak.
29029,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Behind me?
29030,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,What's with this guy?
29031,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He keeps getting faster?
29032,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,And more of his buddies keep showing up.
29033,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Curse those worthless idiots!
29034,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,All of them were defeated?!
29035,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I didn't think your skin would be so tough.
29036,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Cur...
29037,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Curse you!
29038,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How dare you damage my face?!
29039,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'll kill you!
29040,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Ko!
29041,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,She left herself wide open.
29042,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'm not nice enough to overlook that.
29043,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Her attack didn't hit him...
29044,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"No, she sent a little aura with that swing."
29045,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Ko{\i0
29046,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"After focusing his aura into one point, \Nhe didn't expect to deal no damage."
29047,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Nen.{\i0
29048,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"In other words, he was basically defenseless."
29049,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,A puny Emitter attack could \Nhave dealt serious damage.
29050,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,She knows how to use her aura.
29051,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,She has good reason to call herself Queen.
29052,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,This body has no weaknesses!
29053,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Shouldn't we help him?
29054,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Huh? Why?
29055,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,This is a race...
29056,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"If he loses, the next person gets to try."
29057,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Who's up next?
29058,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,We use order of arrival.
29059,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"That's me, then."
29060,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Wait...
29061,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,We both arrived at the same time.
29062,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight."
29063,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide."
29064,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,S-Something's... wrong with them!
29065,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Heads.
29066,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next."
29067,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Bah.
29068,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I was naïve...
29069,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I thought I could become \Nnumber two in no time.
29070,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,But I'm utterly outclassed...
29071,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,It's hopeless.
29072,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,But I won't give up.
29073,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'm used to toughing it out.
29074,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"All for the sake of retrieving my brother, \Nno matter how long it takes."
29075,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,There goes his left arm.
29076,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Fei, wanna trade places?"
29077,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Piece of crap..."""
29078,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Know your place."""
29079,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Crap, run for it..."
29080,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You're gonna get caught in it.
29081,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"When he snaps, he'll hit \Neverything around him!"
29082,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,We tried to watch him once \Nbefore and almost died.
29083,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"His power has a huge range, and activates with his anger, \Nso it knows no restraint."
29084,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"If you get caught up in the \None he's using this time, you're dead, Kalluto."
29085,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,This time?
29086,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,The attack has other forms?
29087,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Darn, I want to see!"
29088,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,What?
29089,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,When did he put that on?!
29090,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Wait... More importantly, \Nhe's much stronger now!"
29091,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Now I return your pain."""
29092,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Feel the heat...
29093,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Pain Packer\N{\fs24
29094,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Pain Packer!
29095,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Rising Sun.
29096,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Burnt by the Sun
29097,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Is it hot?"""
29098,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Throat too scorched to even breathe?"""
29099,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""You could try to run."""
29100,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Assuming you can even move..."""
29101,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""What's wrong?"""
29102,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"""Make use of that tough body you're so proud of."""
29103,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Impossible...
29104,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I am the Queen...
29105,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I cannot die here...
29106,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Out of fuel already?
29107,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,And the heat wasn't that strong...
29108,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,How unfortunate...
29109,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You could have had a quicker death \Nif you'd dealt me more damage.
29110,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Well, you only have yourself to blame."
29111,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,They didn't revert after the Queen's death...
29112,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,But they're no longer under the Queen's control.
29113,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Ple... ...me...
29114,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Please... ki...
29115,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Please... kill... me...
29116,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Please...
29117,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Kill us...
29118,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Hell, no."
29119,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I don't do mercy killings.
29120,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Attack me, trash!"
29121,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"You were living in this place, right?!"
29122,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Have the guts to defend it to the end!
29123,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,You can die with a bang!
29124,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Now those geezers are arguing over whether to exact \Nrevenge upon the real queen.
29125,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Man, I'm sick of those idiots."
29126,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"All they do is sit around a table, \Nsquawking about doing the impossible."
29127,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"But you're still sticking around, right?"
29128,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,There's nothing else for me to do.
29129,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"If more Ants show up, \NI'll wipe them out at once."
29130,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,So I don't have to do any more cleanup.
29131,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Is it the boss?!
29132,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"No, it's Nobunaga."
29133,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He's asking if we'll help with his job.
29134,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,What was that?
29135,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"No way, fool!"
29136,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Man, this sucks."
29137,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I hate having to wait.
29138,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush."
29139,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,He's being very feminine.
29140,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Eh?
29141,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,"What was that, bastards?!"
29142,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Say that again...
29143,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,I'll kill you!
29144,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Hey! We're hurt!
29145,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor \NCity from the Chimera Ant invasion.
29146,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Meanwhile...
29147,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Gon and Killua are preparing to \Ninfiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.
29148,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,The selection of citizens to present \Nto the King by his own guards...
29149,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,...will begin in nine days.
29150,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.
29151,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Meleoron the Chameleon. \NMeleoron the Chameleon.
29152,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Meleoron the Chaleleron!
29153,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Meleoron the Chameleon...
29154,Carnage x And x Devastation.,97,Meleoron the Chameleon!
29155,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"To become kings, the Chimera Ants \Nhave spread across the world, committing acts of utmost \Ntyranny wherever they go."
29156,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Fearing the damage will spread, the government asks the Hunter \NAssociation to exterminate them."
29157,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move."
29158,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Ah, is that all?"
29159,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Infiltration x And x Selection
29160,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Sneaking in was easy.
29161,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But the question is how to get \Nclose enough to the enemy.
29162,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"And we can't let just anyone see us, either."
29163,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Informants
29164,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,This country has a powerful \Ninformation regulation system that operates in secret using groups of informants.
29165,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Informants?
29166,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy, \Nyou receive a reward."
29167,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If you find evidence of insurgency, \Nyou receive a reward."
29168,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If you stop someone from fleeing the \Ncountry, you receive a reward."
29169,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,So the people will do anything for that reward.
29170,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And they aren't just after money.
29171,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"After racking up enough informant points, \Nthe entire group is promoted."
29172,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"But if someone provides false information \Nor a member commits a crime, the entire group is punished."
29173,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Carrot and stick, huh?"
29174,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,It's pretty nasty business.
29175,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Family members are put in different groups.
29176,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"So if an entire group tries to escape, the other family members can be \Nexecuted or imprisoned for life."
29177,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If a family is caught trying to escape together, \Nthey'll be executed, no questions asked."
29178,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"For this country's elite to live the good life, the rest of its citizens must scrape by."
29179,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"But the media also spreads lies. \NSuch as that, in other countries, half the population starves by age ten."
29180,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Foreign aid never reaches the needy.
29181,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles."
29182,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,It's even said that East Gorteau spends \Ngrant money developing nuclear weapons that become bargaining chips in negotiations \Nfor unprecedented foreign aid increases.
29183,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Hey, don't overheat!"
29184,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I th-think I'm okay...
29185,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That was just so complicated...
29186,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But you sure know a lot about it.
29187,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,My brother told me everything.
29188,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And he probably heard it from Grandpa.
29189,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Your grandpa?
29190,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated \Nthe country for a job."
29191,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And I've seen similar information \Non Hunter websites.
29192,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The system is likely still in use.
29193,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,There's a village.
29194,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Yeah... It's not very big.
29195,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,What do we do?
29196,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Sneak in.
29197,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Is that a good idea?
29198,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,We need current information.
29199,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or \Nhow to identify someone's rank will help.
29200,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,They may have certain practices to root out spies.
29201,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"The more data we have, the better."
29202,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Wait here.
29203,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,It's completely deserted...
29204,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?
29205,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"No, something happened here."
29206,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And someone's trying to hide it.
29207,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Huh?
29208,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,They did a sloppy job.
29209,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"They didn't dig deep enough, \Nso wild dogs got to the bodies."
29210,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.
29211,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,What's going on?
29212,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,This is the true purpose of \Nthe national celebration.
29213,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,It's a pretense for entire populations of towns \Nand cities to vanish without raising suspicion.
29214,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The selection has already begun.
29215,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"In hindsight, it would be tough to summon all citizens to \Nthe capital and make the selection so quickly."
29216,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,This nation has a population \Nof around five million.
29217,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Clearing out one town or city \Nat a time is more effective.
29218,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"In that case, their only concern would \Nbe coworkers or family members raising a fuss over the missing."
29219,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"But with the pretext of the national celebration, no one will find it strange that \Nthey can't contact someone."
29220,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed, so if they believe the other party is traveling, \Nit makes sense that they can't contact them."
29221,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The selection will go very smoothly.
29222,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner."
29223,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,They only need to attack the farthest\Ntowns first and work their way east.
29224,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If each town is told that the government \Nwill assign its people a time to depart, there won't be any problems regarding \Ncommunication between towns."
29225,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"So, by preventing people from meeting \Nbetween towns to travel together, they eliminate any cause for commotion."
29226,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But...
29227,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Hmm?
29228,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That means they have to run around the nation \Nto attack all five million citizens.
29229,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Yeah.
29230,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If one percent survives, that gives \Nthem fifty thousand soldiers."
29231,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"No, I mean before that."
29232,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"There are ten... No, nine days left."
29233,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If you wanted to check five \Nmillion people in that time, you'd need a lot of help."
29234,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Nen{\i0 can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...
29235,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Nen{\i0
29236,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Exactly!
29237,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Nen{\i0
29238,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Yeah.
29239,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"I agree, but it probably isn't that hard."
29240,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Nen{\i0
29241,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Huh? Why not?
29242,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,They can use manipulation.
29243,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The power that Chimera Ant used...
29244,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"I'm guessing it can be used \Nto automate victims or, like Genthru's power, can probably be \Nused to control multiple people at once."
29245,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Ordinary humans have aura as well, so the manipulator could force a \Nvictim's aura to concentrate in his fist."
29246,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,One punch alone could create \Nan army of fifty thousand.
29247,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"While leaving four million, nine hundred \Nand fifty thousand dead in the process."
29248,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Well, it isn't all bad news."
29249,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If my theory is correct, causing a commotion to stop their \Nselection will be simple."
29250,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"We merely have to pop up, take out whoever is being controlled, \Nand cause a panic."
29251,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Then we just encourage the people who escape to \Ncheck on other towns nearby.
29252,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Nen{\i0 taking them down will be a cinch.
29253,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"We'll just run around, taking them down \None after another, and wreak havoc."
29254,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Yeah.
29255,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.
29256,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Once we make our move, \Nthey'll know we're here."
29257,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If we want to go with the old man's \Nplan, we should stay hidden."
29258,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,What do you think?
29259,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Let's do it.
29260,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If the selection has already begun, we can't just stand around watching."
29261,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Okay, let's do it."
29262,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Uh-huh!
29263,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But I'll do this alone.
29264,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Huh?
29265,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You stay in hiding.
29266,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Why?
29267,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,It'll go better if we both—
29268,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Don't forget our main mission!
29269,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Defeating that Chimera Ant.
29270,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That should be your focus.
29271,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Let me handle everything else.
29272,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I'll stir things up.
29273,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"And no offense, but I work more easily alone."
29274,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Jeez... Fine, I got it."
29275,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Really?
29276,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Huh?
29277,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Do you really understand?
29278,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Killua?
29279,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Promise me you won't make a move!
29280,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Not even if people are killed \Nright before your eyes!
29281,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Promise!
29282,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I'll contact you by text.
29283,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Our cell phones should still work in this area.
29284,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Killua?
29285,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Sorry... It's nothing!
29286,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I'm just a little tense.
29287,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,What's this?
29288,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,They aren't citizens of this country.
29289,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.
29290,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But they're definitely strong...
29291,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Are they assassins?
29292,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Are they here to hunt down the King?
29293,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Then I can't ignore them...
29294,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But I don't want to fight them both at once.
29295,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I definitely don't want to fight the \Nsilver-haired one on the left.
29296,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong."
29297,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,As much potential as a Squadron Leader?
29298,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That kid is something special.
29299,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"I completely concealed my presence, \Nbut he still sensed something?"
29300,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,How convenient!
29301,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Are you sure about this?
29302,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You'll really transport my family \Nand me to another country?
29303,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Do not worry.
29304,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"We have received official approval, \Nand prepared the necessary documents."
29305,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,All that's left is for you to sign the papers.
29306,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"However, the condition that you share \Nyour complete knowledge of military affairs in exchange for your freedom is essential."
29307,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"As mentioned in the agreement, if you do not keep up your end after signing, we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions."
29308,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That won't be a problem.
29309,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I'll tell you everything...
29310,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,All I know about the atrocities \Nthat Diego has committed.
29311,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,We appreciate it.
29312,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Our lives are on the line, as well."
29313,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"""That Diego has committed""?"
29314,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You talk like it doesn't concern you.
29315,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The wine you're drinking and \Nthe room you stand in were earned by following that bastard.
29316,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"You mean ""that we've committed,"" \Nyou son of a bitch."
29317,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But I get it... We're here on business.
29318,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"So, Marcos-san..."
29319,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Continue going about your business as normal.
29320,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"In two weeks, you and your family \Nwill be relaxing on the beach."
29321,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I can't accept it!
29322,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"We're supposed to stand around, \Nwatching as people are killed?"
29323,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Are you sleepy?
29324,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Want me to put you to sleep, eh?"
29325,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Calm yourself.
29326,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If they're gonna check five \Nmillion citizens in ten days, simple arithmetic says that's \Nfive hundred thousand per day!"
29327,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Of which one percent will survive!
29328,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And your point is?
29329,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"That means four hundred, ninety-five \Nthousand have already been killed!"
29330,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,How can you be so calm?
29331,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!"
29332,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If the plan fails, everyone dies."
29333,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If we can't draw the three Royal \NGuards away from the King, not even the Chairman will \Nbe able to defeat the King."
29334,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Thus, we cannot let them discover \Nour existence before the time is right."
29335,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If that happens, security around the \NKing will be even further tightened."
29336,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You must endure this.
29337,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You're telling me to sacrifice five \Nmillion to save the human race?
29338,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That's right.
29339,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"If blaming me consoles you, go ahead."
29340,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"But if you don't have a better idea, \Ndon't be too self-righteous."
29341,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Damn it...
29342,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,We must do only what we can.
29343,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But we must put our lives on the line to do so.
29344,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Yeah...
29345,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Is Killua okay?
29346,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,He was acting a little weird.
29347,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Maybe I should have stuck with him?
29348,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad."
29349,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You did well to avoid that.
29350,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,How about this?
29351,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"I use my strong tail as a spring, \Nto propel me among the trees!"
29352,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"In the darkness, following my \Nmovement is impossible!"
29353,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Caught you!
29354,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Now I'm going to crush you!
29355,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,You're not crushing me!
29356,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Huh? you{\i0
29357,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"He seems to have a snake's genes, so he should be able to go ten \Ndays without starving to death."
29358,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,As I thought... He's strong...
29359,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But I should continue to observe.
29360,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I already let them find me...
29361,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,I need to hide better.
29362,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,But it's strange...
29363,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Why are there soldiers around if the \Nselection is already finished here?
29364,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Maybe there are extra guards \Nbecause we're near the border.
29365,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,An owl and a bat?
29366,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"This time, he's facing two..."
29367,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,What will he do?
29368,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,The Chimera Ants are using \Ndarkness to attack Gon.
29369,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,And why is Meleoron following him?
29370,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.
29371,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"Come on down, everyone..."
29372,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"I have a perfectly ordinary box, \Nwhich has not been touched."
29373,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,"One, two, three!"
29374,Infiltration x And x Selection.,98,That would be an illusion.
29375,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"After Gon parts ways with Killua \Nin order to stop the selection, he finds himself under attack \Nby new Chimera Ants."
29376,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,An owl and a bat?
29377,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They're both nocturnal creatures...
29378,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Hunters of the night!
29379,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,From the left?
29380,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Bring it!
29381,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The owl's feathers?
29382,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Damn...
29383,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"The bat's wings are so loud, \NI can't hear the owl at all!"
29384,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Combination x And x Evolution
29385,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,My ears can pick up sounds of \Nhigher frequency than other animals'.
29386,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can hear you stepping on leaves \Nand your clothes rustling.
29387,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,All of which tell me exactly where you are!
29388,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,From the right this time!
29389,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The owl uses its feathers to distract me right before the bat attacks...
29390,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They're using both long- and short-range attacks.
29391,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Wait...
29392,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That means...
29393,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.
29394,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We are unrivaled in the darkness!
29395,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I should approach this the opposite way!
29396,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If the owl is acting in a support role,"
29397,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.
29398,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Right after the owl attacks, \Nthe bat will attack!"
29399,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Now!
29400,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Bingo!
29401,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I missed?
29402,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But my timing was perfect!
29403,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Ultrasonic waves?
29404,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Damn, I missed again?"
29405,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Bah, he's correctly guessing \Nthe direction of my attacks."
29406,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"For a human, his ears are sharp."
29407,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"And his aura keeps growing, so my feathers aren't doing any damage."
29408,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The bat uses ultrasonic waves to \Nanticipate the timing of my attack.
29409,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!"
29410,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,First comes rock...
29411,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,His aura continues to grow.
29412,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This could pose a problem.
29413,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Not at all...
29414,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This is our chance.
29415,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He's probably using his ultimate attack.
29416,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If we can evade it, we've won."
29417,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can use my ultrasonic waves \Nto see it in advance.
29418,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Do you need help?
29419,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can."
29420,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The sound's moving away.
29421,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The sound's gone!
29422,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Now, with no wingbeats..."
29423,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I dive!
29424,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That won't work!
29425,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Your wings aren't like the owl's, \Nso I can hear you slice through the air."
29426,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Now, show me your ultimate attack."
29427,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He isn't acting?
29428,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I guess a human can only hear so much.
29429,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"In that case, I'll make my move..."
29430,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I'll slash your jugular!
29431,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Keep my motions minimal.
29432,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Wait until I draw her as near as possible!
29433,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He was baiting me?
29434,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I'm in trouble.
29435,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But his punch will take a \Nfew milliseconds to land.
29436,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I have plenty of time to fly away!
29437,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The noise...
29438,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can't see.
29439,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I must get away!
29440,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You won't escape!
29441,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Rock...
29442,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You aren't the only one that can use sound...
29443,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Paper...
29444,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,...to locate others.
29445,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Paper!
29446,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,All right.
29447,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,A rock?
29448,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He used that to deflect my shot?
29449,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Gorilla Mode
29450,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That was close...
29451,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Damn it!
29452,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I used my special attack and \Nstill couldn't bring it down!
29453,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What was that?
29454,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,There was a sound that made my head spin.
29455,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Is this ultrasound, too?"
29456,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That stupid kid has a loud voice...
29457,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But I'm much better at attacking with sound!
29458,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This is the true power of their combination.
29459,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They strike with sound and finish with brawn.
29460,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What now?
29461,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Do I cover my ears?
29462,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"No, I can't..."
29463,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing, \Nmy reaction time will suffer."
29464,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I know!
29465,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Gyo!
29466,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,His eyes are shining?
29467,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Or is that aura?
29468,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?"
29469,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Let's give him another...
29470,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Ultrasonic Dissonance
29471,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Secret Noise!
29472,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Okay!
29473,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This should help some.
29474,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...
29475,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Water significantly weakens the power of sound!
29476,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Good, this is better..."
29477,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can locate the owl through its aura.
29478,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Here it comes!
29479,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,A feather?
29480,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Zetsu.
29481,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Of course... They started off as wild animals.
29482,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"From birth, they've known \Nto conceal themselves when approaching their prey!"
29483,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"I can fend off their attacks, \Nbut the ultrasound really hurts."
29484,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,If I don't keep up the{\i0 they'll take me down before \NI can even find them!
29485,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"In terms of latent aura, \Nthe kid has a clear advantage."
29486,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Even after being hit all those times, \Nhe's taken no damage."
29487,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But his level of capability is irrelevant.
29488,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Without a strategy, he's just a moving target."
29489,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They work in perfect sync.
29490,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I have to disrupt that!
29491,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top \Nof me, we can't use ultrasound."
29492,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Wrong guess!
29493,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If I use Rock, I can defeat this one."
29494,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But then the bat might run \Nand warn the other Ants!
29495,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"To me, a starry night is as bright as day."
29496,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"As long as I'm not in total darkness,"
29497,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can see you without needing \Nto rely on my hearing!
29498,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,So if I cover my ears...
29499,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can attack at will!
29500,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The kid has shrouded his entire \Nbody in aura to avoid damage.
29501,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"But that reduces the strength of his attacks, \Nmaking it impossible to stand against them."
29502,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"At this rate, he'll never defeat them..."
29503,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It's over for this kid.
29504,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Their weakness is that their movements are always in sync!
29505,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Here!
29506,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They always take positions on opposite sides to avoid both being targeted at once.
29507,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"When the owl is in front of me, the bat is directly behind me!"
29508,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,A giant wall?
29509,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The real wall was behind me...
29510,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He turned our teamwork against us?
29511,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If I only have one opponent, \NI can concentrate on attacking."
29512,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Once he pulls off one plan, \Nthings will go his way..."
29513,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But that attack won't be enough \Nto get him anywhere here.
29514,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Damn!
29515,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,First comes rock...
29516,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Rock... Paper...
29517,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Why, you..."
29518,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Rock!
29519,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I made sure to knock you west!
29520,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Go back to NGL!
29521,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That was incredibly strong...
29522,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I see... This is his real ultimate attack.
29523,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I take back what I said.
29524,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This kid can be useful.
29525,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But how do I proceed?
29526,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Diego has been dethroned.
29527,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Brainwashed soldiers are running around, \Nslaughtering entire villages and towns!"
29528,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Diego has fallen?
29529,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Is that true?
29530,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.
29531,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,There's no time to think about it!
29532,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Just leave this village and run, anywhere!"
29533,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Warn people in other areas!
29534,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Who's interfering?
29535,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It was in the southeast this time.
29536,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Some of my puppets have been stopped.
29537,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That was fast.
29538,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Whoever they are, they're keeping \Nlow and unpredictable."
29539,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,An assassin?
29540,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But they are acting on their own...
29541,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,A decoy?
29542,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This is so annoying...
29543,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I wanna kill them!
29544,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It is no more than a diversion.
29545,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Which means we cannot go.
29546,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You think?
29547,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.
29548,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They're being careful not to let me catch them...
29549,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It may all be an act to draw you out.
29550,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.
29551,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But... But...
29552,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Ah, how I long to indulge myself \Nin the delight of agonizing..."
29553,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It is the sweet trap of the thought process.
29554,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Nothing more.
29555,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The answer is simple.
29556,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Our mission is to protect the King.
29557,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We can let the other Ants handle the rest.
29558,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Is it our turn?
29559,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"When we were injured and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in."
29560,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You even gave us instruction on using our power.
29561,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It is time for us to return the favor!
29562,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Someone's running around \Nand disabling my puppets.
29563,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Can you kill them?
29564,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You can count on me.
29565,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Take this cell phone.
29566,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We can't use telepathy.
29567,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I'll give you updates on their location.
29568,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Understood.
29569,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Can we really trust them?
29570,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Nah, I don't trust them."
29571,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"They're the ones trying to earn our trust, so they'll try hard to carry out their mission."
29572,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It's possible that they're looking for an \Nopportunity to stab us in the back.
29573,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"In that case, we should treat them accordingly."
29574,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The closest village is at two o'clock.
29575,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The next closest villages are \Nat eight and ten o'clock...
29576,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Should I skip them and head for \NTaba, forty kilometers away?"
29577,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Play it safe...
29578,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Don't let anyone find me.
29579,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I can't go this way.
29580,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This is bad...
29581,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I should have taken matters into my own hands.
29582,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What's wrong?
29583,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"As we speak, Cheetu is racing \Ntoward East Gorteau."
29584,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It seems the Hunters that replaced \Nus failed to capture him.
29585,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Is he headed toward us?
29586,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"No, if he continues on his current \Ncourse, he'll pass far to the south."
29587,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Where are you going?
29588,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Don't try to stop me...
29589,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I'm already in a bad mood.
29590,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The Hunter Association has captured three \Nhundred and nineteen Chimera Ants outside of NGL as of yesterday.
29591,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But Colt confirmed that none of \Nthem were Squadron Leaders.
29592,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"According to him, there are eight Squadron Leaders left \Nthat would be considered aggressive."
29593,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Hunters have encountered four, \Nbut they all got away."
29594,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.
29595,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He must know the King is here.
29596,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He's choosing to return to the King's \Nservice in order to increase his power.
29597,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"My ability is still in effect, \Nand I have more raw strength."
29598,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"But if we let him slip away and \Nhe gains even more power, there's no telling who will win next time."
29599,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If we allow more Ants like him to join the King, we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away."
29600,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?
29601,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If you are, I'll fight you first."
29602,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"First, we contact Morel-san."
29603,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If worse comes to worst, \Nhe'll need to replace us."
29604,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I'll come with you.
29605,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This should increase the odds \Nof capturing that Ant.
29606,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It's Knuckle... Something's come up.
29607,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Yes, I'd guess so."
29608,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Probably.
29609,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Yes.
29610,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"So, uh..."
29611,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Hello? Hello?
29612,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Fools!
29613,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I told you to send Riakke!
29614,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He'd have been perfect for this.
29615,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Huh?!
29616,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I don't give a damn!
29617,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What's wrong?
29618,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.
29619,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The review board didn't send \Nthe Hunter we requested!
29620,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Who did they send?
29621,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Some Hunter I've never heard of.
29622,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Probably an Association dog.
29623,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,An Association dog...
29624,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You mean Hunters who only take jobs \Nthrough the Hunter Association.
29625,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It isn't surprising that they have less talent.
29626,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Damn! I should have gone \Nto talk to Riakke myself!
29627,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Don't be foolish!
29628,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If you do anything without board approval, the Chairman will get all the grief."
29629,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,He had to argue with the executive \Ncommittee just to get the two of us here.
29630,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But they don't understand the situation.
29631,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They base it on past accomplishments \Nand donations to the Association...
29632,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The review board has always been inflexible.
29633,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,How can you be so relaxed?!
29634,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If we underestimate the Squadron \NLeaders, we'll pay dearly for it."
29635,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They're strong.
29636,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"After all, they listen to their deepest desires."
29637,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,So they have the talent to quickly master the abilities they need the most.
29638,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If we let the review board bring self-preservation \Nand formality in, we won't get help in time."
29639,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Maybe that's their goal...
29640,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You refer to the rumors that \Nthe Vice-Chairman's faction controls the review board?
29641,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That they're only giving work to Hunters who agree to vote for him in the next election?
29642,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,There's no evidence of anything \Nlike that happening.
29643,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You think they're stupid enough to get caught?
29644,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Look at the facts!
29645,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They've let every Squadron Leader \Nthey've faced escape alive!
29646,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If this expedition fails, \Nthe Chairman will shoulder the blame."
29647,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They're willing to do whatever it \Ntakes to guarantee that result.
29648,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"As the Chimera Ants claim more victims, the voices calling for the Chairman's \Nresignation grow louder."
29649,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Too bad the voices belong to a bunch \Nof people sitting at their desks!
29650,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"If we take out the King and five million \Npeople are already dead, we've failed!"
29651,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We already knew that.
29652,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The Chairman is prepared.
29653,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"When he developed this plan, he was \Nwell aware of the consequences."
29654,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"He knew how long assuring victory would take, and the resulting casualties..."
29655,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Five million is the low end...
29656,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,That's too high!
29657,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Marcos-san?
29658,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What?
29659,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The phones have been ringing nonstop!
29660,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Rumors of a coup d'état are flying around.
29661,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,And it's been discovered that mass murders \Nare taking place all over the nation.
29662,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This is no rumor. It's actually happening!
29663,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,What's going on here?
29664,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Are you responsible for this?
29665,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We haven't done anything!
29666,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The citizens have learned the \Ntruth about the selection?
29667,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We'll discuss this later.
29668,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Return to the office before anyone suspects you.
29669,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Morel!
29670,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Our beloved leader, Diego, has an \Nurgent announcement to make."
29671,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"To ensure that our great leader's message \Nwill be heard throughout the nation, we request that relay speakers in all \Nregions be turned to maximum volume."
29672,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"All televisions and radios should be on, \Nand the volume raised to maximum."
29673,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"Good evening, my beloved comrades."
29674,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I am Diego.
29675,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I have just declared that East \NGorteau is under martial law.
29676,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,This precaution is being taken to combat \Nmalcontents that would foment rebellion.
29677,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"I ask all comrades to stay indoors, \Nwith your doors locked."
29678,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Anyone outdoors without permission will \Nbe identified as a rebel and punished.
29679,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"I ask that you not lend an ear \Nto false rumors being spread, but that you follow my instructions."
29680,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"The soldiers of my special forces \Nwill be visiting your residences, to see if any rebels are hiding inside."
29681,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Do not open your doors for anyone else.
29682,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Their response was too fast.
29683,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,It must be Killua and Gon.
29684,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,They weren't supposed to act.
29685,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.
29686,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"They were so well-prepared, \NI can't believe otherwise."
29687,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,The citizens learning the truth about \Nthe selection wasn't important.
29688,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"In fact, if they did, the military \Nwould have an excuse to mobilize."
29689,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,"East Gorteau has been placed under martial law, completely isolated from the rest of the world."
29690,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Hmm... No problem.
29691,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
29692,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,I will stop them all.
29693,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.
29694,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,98!
29695,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,99!
29696,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,100!
29697,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We want to thank everyone...
29698,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,...for helping us reach 100 episodes!
29699,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,Thank you!
29700,Combination x And x Evolution.,99,We hope you keep watching!
29701,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Someone's running around \Nand disabling my puppets.
29702,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Can you kill them?
29703,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You can count on me.
29704,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Hmm... No problem.
29705,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
29706,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I will stop them all.
29707,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Tracking x And x Pursuit
29708,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Knuckle and Shoot are on the \Nmove to capture Cheetu as he attempts to return to the King.
29709,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's close.
29710,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Okay.
29711,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's following the road.
29712,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If he continues on it, \Nhe'll pass by in ten minutes."
29713,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Do you think he'll stick to the road?
29714,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"No, he'll notice my presence \Njust before he gets here."
29715,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Because APR will start adding interest again.
29716,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,But given his speed...
29717,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,We may be able to attack him \Njust before APR adds interest.
29718,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens \NChapter 7 Bankruptcy
29719,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, attaches APR to an enemy."
29720,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Every ten seconds, APR informs the \Nenemy that interest will be added."
29721,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"But if the enemy is over a hundred meters \Naway from Knuckle, the interest stops."
29722,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"When this happens, the time \Nuntil the next interest payment is remembered by APR."
29723,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Once the enemy is back within \NKnuckle's hundred-meter range,"
29724,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,APR picks up where it stopped.
29725,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's approaching at a speed between \N160 and 180 kilometers per hour.
29726,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If there are still three seconds or more \Nbefore APR adds interest again, there's a good chance we can \Nattack before he notices us."
29727,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Here he comes!
29728,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What's wrong?
29729,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Damn, what happened?"
29730,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!"
29731,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's down below!
29732,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Knuckle...
29733,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Don't bother. We can't catch up.
29734,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.
29735,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Zetsu{\i0
29736,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,How did he discover our ambush?
29737,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Could it be...
29738,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,We're slightly downwind.
29739,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The breeze is blowing this way \Nwith no change in direction.
29740,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,So he didn't smell us.
29741,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Look up!
29742,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What's that?
29743,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I've discovered two suspicious figures.
29744,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What should I do?
29745,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Ignore them. They aren't the target.
29746,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No point in doing more work than necessary.
29747,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Yes, sir."
29748,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It appears they were trying \Nto ambush Cheetu-sama.
29749,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Oh, he's in the area?"
29750,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.
29751,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Was that unnecessary?
29752,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What did Cheetu do?
29753,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He took a detour toward the capital.
29754,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He told me to thank you for the help.
29755,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I see, good work."
29756,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He owes me now.
29757,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,This is Leol.
29758,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The target just engaged a squad of \Nsoldiers in the city of Longtong.
29759,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Longtong?
29760,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Head north and try to cut it off.
29761,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Just a hunch.
29762,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Understood.
29763,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Looks like even the army can't handle this.
29764,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"No... Well, they're only there to buy time."
29765,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,They've had to stay in one area \Nfor a longer period of time.
29766,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"After all, it's been moving constantly \Nfor over thirty hours."
29767,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Diego has fallen into enemy hands!
29768,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!"
29769,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Liar!
29770,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Rebel scum!
29771,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Damn... Diego just appeared on TV, \Nlooking alive and well."
29772,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The odds are against me now.
29773,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'll have to give up my instigation.
29774,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,My only option is to take out as many \Npuppets and soldiers as I can!
29775,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Should I go north next?
29776,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I knew it.
29777,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Someone's still following me!
29778,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Who's there?!
29779,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If you want something, show yourself!"
29780,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The presence has completely vanished.
29781,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It might be following me until \Nmore Chimera Ants show up.
29782,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm gonna shake it!
29783,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It can't outlast me!
29784,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Yo...
29785,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Yo.
29786,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Sorry for stopping you.
29787,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Nah, I was headed this way."
29788,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?"
29789,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Yeah, I know. It's Leol now."
29790,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Then you did that on purpose?
29791,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You're still a bastard.
29792,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Flutter's warning was a big help.
29793,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights..."
29794,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm glad to hear that.
29795,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"By the way, what's that thing?"
29796,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No idea.
29797,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,A Hunter hit me with it.
29798,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It follows me wherever I run.
29799,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Not sure what to do.
29800,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect."
29801,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Want me to get rid of it?
29802,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Do you want me to get rid of it?
29803,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You can do that?
29804,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Probably.
29805,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"But not for free, right?"
29806,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm glad you're so understanding.
29807,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Figured.
29808,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.
29809,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'd like your help.
29810,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Leol-sama...
29811,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I've spotted the target.
29812,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's headed north on the road through \Nthe forest northeast of Longtong.
29813,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...
29814,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Don't let him get away.
29815,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Use all your forces to slow him down.
29816,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Yes, sir."
29817,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,We're chasing down a human.
29818,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's probably a Hunter.
29819,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,And you want me to help hunt him?
29820,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You said he's a Hunter?
29821,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,They can be tough to deal with...
29822,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Of course, so I've planned ahead."
29823,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Shaiapouf-dono has prepared \Na power tailored for you.
29824,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He will teach you to use it.
29825,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"With luck, you can master it in a day."
29826,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I'm a slow learner, so mine took me \Nthree days to get the hang of."
29827,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Sounds like a sweet deal...
29828,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"In return, I swear loyalty to the King?"
29829,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Exactly... Easy enough, right?"
29830,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Sure, I just wanted an explanation."
29831,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You're a sharp fellow.
29832,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If you accept, return to the castle, master your new power, \Nand then contact me."
29833,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"In the meantime, I'll have my underlings \Ndetermine the target's abilities."
29834,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Well, I guess I owe you one."
29835,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Might as well.
29836,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory."
29837,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Naturally.
29838,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I was once king of the jungle.
29839,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne."
29840,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Damn, I'm being followed."
29841,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,And he's way out of yo-yo range.
29842,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble."
29843,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,There's a jungle over there!
29844,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"The leaves are dense enough, he shouldn't be able to see me from the air."
29845,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If he descends to follow, \Nhe'll be in range of my yo-yo!"
29846,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He isn't coming?
29847,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Did I lose him?
29848,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"But in that case, he should \Ncome looking for me."
29849,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Damn...
29850,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I don't have time to wait around!
29851,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Hurry up, already!"
29852,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You can't hide from me.
29853,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Go forth, soldiers of Leol."
29854,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Capture your prey!
29855,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Something's coming, but from the opposite side, and it's on the ground!"
29856,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He removed his foe's head \Nand arms with one swing!
29857,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I can't beat him in a one-on-one, \Nclose-quarters fight..."
29858,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Where is he?!
29859,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Captain! Above you!
29860,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm gonna die—
29861,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I missed two of them!
29862,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,\Nand we can't even touch him!"
29863,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Retreat!
29864,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Time to regroup!
29865,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I won't let you escape...
29866,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You must be the leader.
29867,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'll eliminate you first!
29868,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,How'd you like that blast?
29869,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,That bastard...
29870,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He blew a fart at me!
29871,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"No, there's a bigger problem..."
29872,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I completely concealed my presence, \Nand attacked from his blind spot."
29873,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,But he countered at the perfect time.
29874,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Someone must be instructing \Nhim from a distance.
29875,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It must be him!
29876,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He's probably watching right now.
29877,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'd guess he has a power that \Nlets him track my location.
29878,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,In that case...
29879,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I can't show him the cards \Nin my hand, no matter what."
29880,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I don't want them to learn \Nof my lightning or yo-yo!
29881,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The ideal scenario would be to lose \Nthem and go back into hiding.
29882,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,But that's looking impossible.
29883,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'll have to defeat them all without using—
29884,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,A gun?
29885,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No...
29886,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,There's something stuck to my face...
29887,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,A flea?
29888,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,A flea?
29889,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Damn!
29890,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Where did it come from?!
29891,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2."
29892,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1."
29893,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Okay.
29894,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"There's no escaping... from my Fleadom, oh yeah."
29895,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Damn!
29896,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The bleeding won't stop.
29897,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,These fleas are more than just big bugs...
29898,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4."
29899,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1."
29900,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Okay.
29901,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.
29902,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The real goal is to exhaust my \Nstrength through blood loss!
29903,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,My fleas are very special...
29904,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,They have a 200-meter vertical leap.
29905,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"And when you factor in... my air gun's power, they become unstoppable, oh yeah."
29906,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Oh? He's already able to dodge them?
29907,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.
29908,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If I keep running around, it'll be \Nharder for them to snipe me!"
29909,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,But I have to conserve stamina.
29910,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Ah, he's going to try something."
29911,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He may try to use his power.
29912,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Let's see what he can do.
29913,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Okay.
29914,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,My Super Eye allows me to observe a target from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.
29915,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No ability you use can escape my sight.
29916,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Now, let's see what you do."
29917,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,En{\i0
29918,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Expanding his aura around him \Nand maintaining it for a long time is by no means his forte.
29919,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Killua knows this shortcoming.
29920,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"And so, he keeps his aura within \Nthe range he can best manage."
29921,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.
29922,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Not much room to work with.
29923,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"In other words, the moment a projectile is \Nwithin fifty-seven centimeters of his body,"
29924,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes and physical strength to react \Nwith desperate speed, and dodge at point-blank range."
29925,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"But this time, he didn't dodge!"
29926,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,All to determine the angle of \Nthe projectile's approach.
29927,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Damn... It came from this way!
29928,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"He let himself be hit, so he \Ncould locate the sniper."
29929,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The target is quickly heading your way.
29930,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Okay.
29931,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I somewhat expected this.
29932,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The bleeding's stopped anywhere \Nthat the fleas only scratched me.
29933,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,They must secrete some chemical that \Nstops blood from clotting naturally.
29934,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If I start bleeding in too many \Nplaces, I'll be in trouble."
29935,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I can't let him escape!
29936,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,This is perfect.
29937,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I can see clearly in every direction.
29938,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,How do you like this?
29939,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,There's nowhere for you to hide!
29940,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Bring it on!
29941,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Wait!
29942,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,This desert is massive.
29943,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"If you don't have any water, \Nyou'll die of thirst in a day."
29944,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Too bad...
29945,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I wanted to observe you a little longer, but I guess that won't work."
29946,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I was running low on stamina, anyway."
29947,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I suppose this gives us more \Ntime to talk things over...
29948,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Let's begin with introductions.
29949,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"My name is Jail... \NScratch that, it's Meleoron."
29950,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"When the Queen was still alive, \NI was a Squadron Leader."
29951,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Nice to meet you.
29952,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What's your name?
29953,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Why were you following me?
29954,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Because I didn't want to let you get away.
29955,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,And I certainly couldn't let you die...
29956,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Because you'll be a valuable partner.
29957,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"You have business with the King, right?"
29958,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I do not!
29959,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Huh?
29960,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,That was dangerous...
29961,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He must have a reason for approaching me.
29962,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I can't tell him anything.
29963,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?
29964,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"""You guys""?"
29965,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Yep... I've been watching you since \Nthat other kid was with you.
29966,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I understand.
29967,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,And you felt that I would put up \Nless of a fight than Killua!
29968,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Huh? Eh?!
29969,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You've got it all wrong!
29970,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,That's how you interpret it?
29971,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I guess it makes sense...
29972,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"To you, I'd look like an enemy."
29973,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.
29974,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Listen up.
29975,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I swear that I'm not lying.
29976,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!
29977,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Okay, I believe you."
29978,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Of course... It's hard to believe!
29979,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I can sympathize.
29980,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,If I were in your shoes...
29981,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Eh?
29982,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Is that him?
29983,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,This is a trap.
29984,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,You still wanna come?
29985,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Couldn't care less.
29986,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Die.
29987,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,He instantly acted to kill me...
29988,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,No hesitation at all.
29989,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I'm impressed!
29990,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,An underground lake?
29991,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Lookin' for a taste of hell?
29992,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Here you go!
29993,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Blood!
29994,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Food!
29995,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,It's food!
29996,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Wait, this is..."
29997,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Captain Ikalgo's host!
29998,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Crap, stop eating it."
29999,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"I want to stop, but I can't..."
30000,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,The blood is calling to us!
30001,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Bastard!
30002,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,How dare you chop off my precious legs?!
30003,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,I couldn't let you drag me into the water.
30004,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,These suction cups saved me.
30005,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Anyway, aren't you an octopus?"
30006,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Don't call me an octopus!
30007,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,"Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo, a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling \Nan octopus, that uses human hosts."
30008,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Don't call me an octopus!
30009,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.
30010,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?
30011,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,An octopus.
30012,Tracking x And x Pursuit.,100,Don't call me an octopus!
30013,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,These suction cups saved me.
30014,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Anyway, aren't you an octopus?"
30015,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don—
30016,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Ikalgo x And x Lightning
30017,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he \Nand Gon split up to stop the selection.
30018,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"One of them is Ikalgo, \Nan octopus Chimera Ant."
30019,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Aren't you an octopus?
30020,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't call me an octopus!
30021,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,See ya!
30022,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I need to find a new host, or \NI can't charge up my next shot."
30023,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.
30024,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Yo, we meet again."
30025,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,So we do...
30026,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Long time, no see!"
30027,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Ya know?
30028,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Can I ask you something?
30029,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Sure, go ahead!"
30030,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?
30031,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You should have an advantage in the water.
30032,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't tell me you can't swim.
30033,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Uh, well..."
30034,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"It's the blood, right?"
30035,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"When they smell blood, your \Nbuddies in the water go berserk and attack the injured, no matter who it is."
30036,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"With those wounds, if you went in there, \Nyou'd be torn to shreds."
30037,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Am I wrong?
30038,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Uh, w-well..."
30039,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I suppose that's one way to...
30040,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?"
30041,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"No, we're still fighting!"
30042,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Who are you talking to?
30043,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I screwed up!
30044,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Right, you all can communicate via telepathy."
30045,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Talking to your boss? It's that guy \Nwho was flying over me, right?"
30046,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Wait, now look here..."
30047,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Uh, so..."
30048,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!"
30049,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You could say that's what I might be doing...
30050,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yes! We're still fighting!
30051,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Oh, sorry to interrupt you."
30052,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Let me know if you learn anything.
30053,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"If he sees dozens of dragonflies \Nflying around inside a cave, the enemy would get suspicious..."
30054,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I won't be able to send my \NSatellite Dragonflies inside.
30055,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Let's make a deal, then."
30056,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"If you tell me about his power, \NI'll spare your life."
30057,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You have ten seconds to answer.
30058,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Eight seconds left.
30059,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Six seconds.
30060,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I wanted to be reborn a squid...
30061,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Chiroteuthis imperator{\i0
30062,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Do you think octopi and squid are similar?
30063,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"If so, you're mistaken..."
30064,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Octopi are ugly.
30065,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Squid are squidderific.
30066,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I think they look divine!
30067,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Two seconds.
30068,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I won't betray a buddy!
30069,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Yeah, I could see that in your eyes."
30070,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I can only hope that in my next life, I'll be born a squid..."
30071,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Wh—
30072,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Why?
30073,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Because you're a cool guy.
30074,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"In different circumstances, \Nwe could've been friends."
30075,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You lowered your guard!
30076,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Didn't think fish could jump, eh?"
30077,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'll crush you and the rock behind you!
30078,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Come in, Ikalgo."
30079,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!"
30080,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Has he used any weapons or special abilities?
30081,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Ikalgo!
30082,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"No, he's been fighting... with only his bare hands."
30083,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Come on... Beg for your life.
30084,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Otherwise, it's no fun!"
30085,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Or are you in too much pain to talk?
30086,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Yeah, this is a relief."
30087,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Huh?
30088,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.
30089,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Huh?
30090,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I have no qualms about killing you.
30091,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yep! He was just a scumbag!
30092,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That's why he was the decoy!
30093,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I did it, Ortho-sama!"
30094,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I've attached the badge!
30095,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Coburn pulled it off!
30096,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Time to start the game.
30097,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Let's enjoy ourselves.
30098,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Damn, the bleeding won't stop..."
30099,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I need to find an exit.
30100,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A digital sound inside my head?
30101,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Wha—
30102,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What?
30103,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A fish? But I'm not in the water!
30104,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What's going on?
30105,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I didn't sense anything!
30106,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Again...
30107,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I didn't see anything or sense any \Naura until the fish hit me!
30108,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What's going on?
30109,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,This is bad.
30110,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.
30111,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,108 points.
30112,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You have no idea what's going on?
30113,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I should say that you're \Nhearing my voice in your head.
30114,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Well, if you survive long enough, \Nyou'll figure out what's happening."
30115,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,These are fish made from{\i0
30116,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,So why can't I sense them?
30117,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Something must be triggering \Nthem from somewhere else.
30118,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That's the only possible explanation!
30119,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,How else could I be attacked by \Nsomething I can't see or sense?
30120,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,This is going well...
30121,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Well, have you determined \Nanything about these attacks?"
30122,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Three...
30123,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,He can only materialize three fish at once.
30124,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"After that, the fish will disappear."
30125,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,And the vivid colors of the \Ntarget he put on me...
30126,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It can only mean one thing!
30127,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Your power involves darts!
30128,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Bingo.
30129,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That's correct.
30130,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,But the great thing about our power \Nis that figuring it out won't help you.
30131,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Nen{\i0 have no physical form until the \Ninstant they pierce your flesh.
30132,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That makes it impossible to block them.
30133,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points."
30134,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I have a dart board that's linked to various parts of your body.
30135,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,For instance...
30136,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Your right elbow is 27 points.
30137,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Your right hand is 18 points.
30138,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,99 points...
30139,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Hey, what's wrong?"
30140,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I can't hear your screams.
30141,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Are you already dead?
30142,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,The game's only just begun.
30143,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Triple 6!
30144,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,4!
30145,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,13!
30146,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Bravo!
30147,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Brother, that was magnificent."
30148,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You're on a roll.
30149,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Naturally...
30150,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Our lives are on the line...
30151,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.
30152,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Nen{\i0 which activates after it's affixed to the target.
30153,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That links the target to the dart \Nboard created by the brother.
30154,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Until the game ends, no one \Ncan deactivate the badge, not even the Ortho Siblings."
30155,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"When the brother's darts hit the board, \Nthe target is attacked by needlefish."
30156,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,There is no way to avoid this attack.
30157,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"That is because, until they've \Nhit the target's body, the needlefish do not exist."
30158,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Thus, it is impossible to sense \Nthem coming or dodge them."
30159,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,This is our unbeatable power...
30160,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Needlefish De Darts!
30161,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Death Games
30162,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Needlefish De Darts
30163,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Of course, the siblings incur some risk."
30164,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Once the badge activates, they are invincible."
30165,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"But if the brother misses the board with the \Nfinal dart that decides the game's outcome, all of the damage the target has taken will transfer to the siblings."
30166,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,We are invincible. That is because...
30167,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,We are bound by the \Nstrongest trust in the world.
30168,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It isn't over yet...
30169,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Well, it seems the game's almost over."
30170,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Why don't you tell him that?
30171,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,No need to be that nice.
30172,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"If he were pleading for his life, \Nit'd be easier for me to focus."
30173,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Or if he were to give up \Nand beg me to kill him, or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero \Nand said, ""Not a bad way to die."""
30174,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Those would help motivate me, \Nas I toss my darts."
30175,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"But he'll just have to dread his impending \Ndeath, never knowing when it will end..."
30176,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Until he dies.
30177,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's not...
30178,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's not over yet!
30179,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Damn...
30180,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,This looks pretty bad...
30181,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I've lost way too much blood.
30182,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I could die here, so no point in saving what's left."
30183,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Now, then."
30184,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's my final turn.
30185,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Left ear.
30186,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That sure gave him a big earring.
30187,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Right calf!
30188,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Okay, time for the last throw."
30189,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"My brother, I trust you."
30190,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I've got this.
30191,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,See?
30192,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Bravo!
30193,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30194,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30195,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30196,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You're the best in the world!
30197,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'll go check his corpse.
30198,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'll come with you.
30199,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,We should share some of the \Nmeat with Coburn as a reward.
30200,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Aren't you gonna eat?
30201,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Can I ask you something?
30202,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What?
30203,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What made you decide to trust me?
30204,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It wasn't that I didn't trust you.
30205,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I just didn't know why you were following me.
30206,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,And you swore that you weren't lying.
30207,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Huh?! That's it?
30208,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Isn't that enough?
30209,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Hell, no!"
30210,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Liars make promises all the time!
30211,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A promise is the one thing \Nyou should never trust!
30212,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Then you were lying?
30213,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'm different...
30214,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I don't lie!
30215,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I only tell the truth!
30216,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Then it's okay.
30217,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I think I'm starting to lose it.
30218,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"He's strong, but he's just a kid."
30219,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'm putting my fate in the \Nhands of this clueless boy?
30220,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Besides, if you're lying, that'll \Nactually make things easier for me."
30221,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Easier?
30222,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I won't have to show you any mercy.
30223,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'll be free to destroy you.
30224,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,The look... The look in the kid's eyes...
30225,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Yes, this is why I had a hunch..."
30226,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,There's something special about this kid.
30227,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I can't even tell how much \Npower he really has...
30228,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You hit him right in the forehead.
30229,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target."
30230,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Really? That's excellent.
30231,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I will tell Leol-sama that a \Npromotion is in order.
30232,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Thank you very much.
30233,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Great!
30234,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,We can be assistant squadron leaders now!
30235,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30236,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30237,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Yay!
30238,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,H-How?
30239,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,How can you be alive with a dart \Nsticking out of your brain?!
30240,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What?
30241,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's a suction cup from an octopus.
30242,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,No way.
30243,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,How did you manage that trick?
30244,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"No, wait..."
30245,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,My... My darts were perfect!
30246,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's absolutely impossible to stop them!
30247,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Yeah, I didn't stop it."
30248,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I just grabbed it, the moment it materialized at my head."
30249,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"From what you were saying, I could tell you could hear my voice, \Nbut you couldn't see me."
30250,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I had plenty of time to switch out \Nthe needle for a suction cup.
30251,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,H-Hold on...
30252,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,No human has reflexes fast \Nenough to catch a dart!
30253,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Well, it wouldn't have been possible had \NI not known where it would appear."
30254,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,But I knew exactly where and \Nwhen the last dart would hit.
30255,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,The final dart must hit the board's \Nouter ring per double out rules.
30256,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,And you were playing an 01—501 game.
30257,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"You start with 501 points, \Nand the goal is to reach 0."
30258,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,These rules are used in professional competition.
30259,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I n-never told you what rules I was using!
30260,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"As soon as I knew you were playing darts, \Nmy suspicions were confirmed."
30261,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Remember how your first dart hit double 4?
30262,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.
30263,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A double in...
30264,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A sign that you were confident in your skill.
30265,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,A skilled player would play by official rules.
30266,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Players with talent and confidence \Ntend to seek public recognition.
30267,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"After that, I just had to do the \Nmath and endure the pain."
30268,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I subtracted your points from 501, and waited until your score was under 40."
30269,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"At that point,"
30270,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead."
30271,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,That's all it took.
30272,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"To improve his reflexes, Killua changed \Nhis aura into electricity."
30273,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"When the dart touched his skin, the sensation did not travel from his skin to his brain \Nusing the nervous system."
30274,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Nen{\i0 it sent a message directly to his \Nleft hand, to grab the dart."
30275,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Do you have some history with darts?
30276,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"At age six, I mastered the game."
30277,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I've counted down from 1,440 points."
30278,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It was part of my early training.
30279,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It's your fault for getting cocky \Nand talking too much!
30280,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Or was I seven?
30281,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,You're so stupid!
30282,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Guess it doesn't matter...
30283,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!
30284,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I talked too long.
30285,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I need to hurry!
30286,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Huh?
30287,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What?
30288,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,My body won't do what I tell it to...
30289,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Wait, is this really happening?"
30290,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Wow...
30291,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,All this is my blood?
30292,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.
30293,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Wait, this isn't the time to think about that..."
30294,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I should get going.
30295,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Crap... Now I feel cold...
30296,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Damn...
30297,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,And after that last fight gave me a hint... for improving my power.
30298,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Am I... going to die here?
30299,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Gon... Sorry...
30300,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I wasn't any... help...
30301,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Octopus...
30302,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't call me an octopus!
30303,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,What are you doing?
30304,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Isn't that obvious?
30305,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'm turning traitor.
30306,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"Lame, huh?"
30307,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Now stop talking.
30308,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I know a secret doctor.
30309,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,It won't take long by underground waterway.
30310,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't die before we get there!
30311,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Are you an idiot?
30312,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I spared... your life...
30313,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Now they'll be hunting you...
30314,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I know that!
30315,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't ask me why I'm doing this.
30316,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,But you know...
30317,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"After you told me, an octopus, \Nthat I was a cool guy..."
30318,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,After you said we could be friends...
30319,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I couldn't let you die!
30320,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,I'm gonna save you!
30321,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Don't die on me!
30322,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,Next time: Power x And x Games.
30323,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"If you smoke, your teeth will turn black."
30324,Ikalgo x And x Lightning.,101,"I'm a chameleon, so I don't have teeth!"
30325,Power x And x Games.,102,But you know...
30326,Power x And x Games.,102,"After you told me, an octopus, \Nthat I was a cool guy..."
30327,Power x And x Games.,102,After you said we could be friends...
30328,Power x And x Games.,102,I couldn't let you die!
30329,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm gonna save you!
30330,Power x And x Games.,102,Don't die on me!
30331,Power x And x Games.,102,Power x And x Games
30332,Power x And x Games.,102,"While Killua was being rescued \Nby the Chimera Ant Ikalgo, his supposed enemy,"
30333,Power x And x Games.,102,"Gon, too, was forming a bond with \Na Chimera Ant called Meleoron."
30334,Power x And x Games.,102,You should stop smoking.
30335,Power x And x Games.,102,"If the smoke sticks to you, people can smell you coming, and it'll \Nwaste your ability to become invisible."
30336,Power x And x Games.,102,I appreciate the warning.
30337,Power x And x Games.,102,"But honestly, that doesn't matter."
30338,Power x And x Games.,102,"While my invisibility is a sort of calling card, my real power is on an entirely different level."
30339,Power x And x Games.,102,Just watch.
30340,Power x And x Games.,102,Huh?! He vanished in an instant...
30341,Power x And x Games.,102,I can't sense him at all.
30342,Power x And x Games.,102,Only the smell of cigarettes.
30343,Power x And x Games.,102,He's gone...
30344,Power x And x Games.,102,This isn't mere invisibility.
30345,Power x And x Games.,102,"Does he also have the ability to change locations instantly, \Nwithout making any sound?"
30346,Power x And x Games.,102,That isn't possible!
30347,Power x And x Games.,102,How did he do it?!
30348,Power x And x Games.,102,Where'd you come from?
30349,Power x And x Games.,102,I've been here the entire time.
30350,Power x And x Games.,102,Huh?
30351,Power x And x Games.,102,My second ability is Perfect Plan.
30352,Power x And x Games.,102,God's Alibi\NPerfect Plan
30353,Power x And x Games.,102,"When I hold my breath, no one can sense my existence."
30354,Power x And x Games.,102,You were even touching me...
30355,Power x And x Games.,102,But your mind didn't realize it.
30356,Power x And x Games.,102,Eh? I touched you?
30357,Power x And x Games.,102,You know how some people are easily overlooked?
30358,Power x And x Games.,102,"When you go to a restaurant in a group, there's always one person that the \Nwaitress forgets to bring water."
30359,Power x And x Games.,102,This is an extreme version.
30360,Power x And x Games.,102,"I'm right here, but no one notices me."
30361,Power x And x Games.,102,Oh...
30362,Power x And x Games.,102,I use my other ability to turn invisible to cover this one so no one can learn about it.
30363,Power x And x Games.,102,"For the record, you and I are \Nthe only ones in the world who know this."
30364,Power x And x Games.,102,Why tell me something so important?
30365,Power x And x Games.,102,"Well, it's to build trust."
30366,Power x And x Games.,102,Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...
30367,Power x And x Games.,102,"If I can't convince you to trust me, \Nwe can't start anything."
30368,Power x And x Games.,102,"You mean, what you said about \Nme being a valuable partner?"
30369,Power x And x Games.,102,"Yeah, but that's for later."
30370,Power x And x Games.,102,"Like I said, we have to trust each other first."
30371,Power x And x Games.,102,"Once you've agreed to be my \Npartner, I'll tell you more."
30372,Power x And x Games.,102,"Okay, I'll be your partner."
30373,Power x And x Games.,102,That was fast!
30374,Power x And x Games.,102,"You don't know how to bargain, kid."
30375,Power x And x Games.,102,Don't be so trusting of me!
30376,Power x And x Games.,102,Suspect everyone!
30377,Power x And x Games.,102,"Until you've done due diligence, \Ndon't trust anyone!"
30378,Power x And x Games.,102,Huh?
30379,Power x And x Games.,102,"I said it's okay, so why are \Nyou being so difficult?"
30380,Power x And x Games.,102,Can you even make this decision on your own?!
30381,Power x And x Games.,102,What about your buddy?
30382,Power x And x Games.,102,He'll have a fit when he hears you teamed up with \Na suspicious-looking monster...
30383,Power x And x Games.,102,And why am I insulting myself?
30384,Power x And x Games.,102,I didn't choose to be this way!
30385,Power x And x Games.,102,He talks a lot...
30386,Power x And x Games.,102,Whatever.
30387,Power x And x Games.,102,Even a friend of twenty years \Ncould stab you in the back.
30388,Power x And x Games.,102,Time is no measure of trust!
30389,Power x And x Games.,102,"Say, ""Ho""!"
30390,Power x And x Games.,102,You're no fun...
30391,Power x And x Games.,102,We can never be friends.
30392,Power x And x Games.,102,I feel the same way...
30393,Power x And x Games.,102,"Then, are you sure about this?"
30394,Power x And x Games.,102,About what?
30395,Power x And x Games.,102,About teaming up with me.
30396,Power x And x Games.,102,Won't your buddy object?
30397,Power x And x Games.,102,Most likely.
30398,Power x And x Games.,102,Because he tends to be cautious \Nand to question everything.
30399,Power x And x Games.,102,"This won't work, then."
30400,Power x And x Games.,102,The deal's dead in the water.
30401,Power x And x Games.,102,"But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine."
30402,Power x And x Games.,102,"Killua won't like it, but he'll give in."
30403,Power x And x Games.,102,Really... He must have a hard time.
30404,Power x And x Games.,102,"Well, whatever. \NIf you say it's okay, I'll trust you."
30405,Power x And x Games.,102,So let's get to business.
30406,Power x And x Games.,102,Yeah.
30407,Power x And x Games.,102,I want to defeat the King.
30408,Power x And x Games.,102,Want to know why?
30409,Power x And x Games.,102,"Yeah, of course."
30410,Power x And x Games.,102,That's what I've been waiting for...
30411,Power x And x Games.,102,Revenge.
30412,Power x And x Games.,102,"Right now, I can't tell you \Nwhy I want revenge..."
30413,Power x And x Games.,102,Okay.
30414,Power x And x Games.,102,"I'd like to know, but I'll wait."
30415,Power x And x Games.,102,That's probably what he wants to hear...
30416,Power x And x Games.,102,"If you're that curious, I'll tell you."
30417,Power x And x Games.,102,You'll tell me now?!
30418,Power x And x Games.,102,Just kidding!
30419,Power x And x Games.,102,"Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now."
30420,Power x And x Games.,102,I didn't beg you for anything.
30421,Power x And x Games.,102,The King killed someone I owed my life to.
30422,Power x And x Games.,102,His name was Peggy.
30423,Power x And x Games.,102,I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.
30424,Power x And x Games.,102,"But at the time, I didn't realize \Nwhat had happened."
30425,Power x And x Games.,102,Huh? Why not?
30426,Power x And x Games.,102,"You saw it happen, didn't you?"
30427,Power x And x Games.,102,Because I'd forgotten that Peggy was the one who raised me.
30428,Power x And x Games.,102,"A little while ago, I began to recover my \Nmemories from when I was human."
30429,Power x And x Games.,102,I haven't remembered everything.
30430,Power x And x Games.,102,"No, I should rephrase that..."
30431,Power x And x Games.,102,I've only remembered a few things.
30432,Power x And x Games.,102,"The names of my parents, my name, \Nepisodes from my childhood."
30433,Power x And x Games.,102,Peggy was the name of the \NChimera Ant the King killed.
30434,Power x And x Games.,102,That was also my foster father's human name.
30435,Power x And x Games.,102,"He was into education, and always \Ncarried thick books around."
30436,Power x And x Games.,102,"In both life and death, he never \Nparted with his books about NGL."
30437,Power x And x Games.,102,Then you all have memories \Nfrom when you were human?
30438,Power x And x Games.,102,I don't know if we're all the same.
30439,Power x And x Games.,102,Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.
30440,Power x And x Games.,102,"With others, there's no \Ntelling what they're thinking."
30441,Power x And x Games.,102,But I think I understand now.
30442,Power x And x Games.,102,"This is why, when we first met, \NI was willing to trust you."
30443,Power x And x Games.,102,You're very human.
30444,Power x And x Games.,102,More human than any other \NChimera Ant I've met.
30445,Power x And x Games.,102,"In fact, I'd say you're still human."
30446,Power x And x Games.,102,"Really? When I met you, \NI had the opposite reaction."
30447,Power x And x Games.,102,Huh?
30448,Power x And x Games.,102,I could sense a vicious beast inside you.
30449,Power x And x Games.,102,That's why I wanted to team up.
30450,Power x And x Games.,102,There's no limit to what you'll do.
30451,Power x And x Games.,102,"All right... Now, let's get down to business."
30452,Power x And x Games.,102,"But first, could you tell me your name?"
30453,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.
30454,Power x And x Games.,102,I actually have one more ability.
30455,Power x And x Games.,102,And the condition for its \Nactivation has been met.
30456,Power x And x Games.,102,Time to show you my third power!
30457,Power x And x Games.,102,Activate!
30458,Power x And x Games.,102,It isn't flying away...
30459,Power x And x Games.,102,"Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?"
30460,Power x And x Games.,102,Exactly.
30461,Power x And x Games.,102,"This is my third power, God's Accomplice."
30462,Power x And x Games.,102,"While Perfect Plan is active, it allows \Nanyone I touch to use it, as well."
30463,Power x And x Games.,102,Do you understand how powerful \Nthis technique is now?
30464,Power x And x Games.,102,This power will let us approach \Nand attack the enemy... without their knowledge.
30465,Power x And x Games.,102,The King's strength doesn't matter...
30466,Power x And x Games.,102,"If we can sneak up and use a powerful \Nattack when his guard is lowered, we'll win."
30467,Power x And x Games.,102,"Hey, Gon..."
30468,Power x And x Games.,102,You're the partner I've been looking for.
30469,Power x And x Games.,102,The perfect guy to smack the King with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!
30470,Power x And x Games.,102,I was watching when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.
30471,Power x And x Games.,102,Those were my soldiers.
30472,Power x And x Games.,102,"I sent them to attack, so I could \Nmeasure your strength, but they..."
30473,Power x And x Games.,102,"Ah, no need to feel bad..."
30474,Power x And x Games.,102,They were killing for sport when \NI wasn't paying attention.
30475,Power x And x Games.,102,"They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies."
30476,Power x And x Games.,102,"Well, from their perspective, \NI'm the one who's changed."
30477,Power x And x Games.,102,What you said about being your partner...
30478,Power x And x Games.,102,There's someone who'd be better than me.
30479,Power x And x Games.,102,You know someone?
30480,Power x And x Games.,102,Yep.
30481,Power x And x Games.,102,I'll contact him.
30482,Power x And x Games.,102,Hold on.
30483,Power x And x Games.,102,I trust you.
30484,Power x And x Games.,102,"And even if you end up turning on me, \NI won't blame you or regret my decision."
30485,Power x And x Games.,102,"Because I watched you, spoke to you, \Nand decided to trust you."
30486,Power x And x Games.,102,But I'm not about to trust others \Njust because you trust them.
30487,Power x And x Games.,102,Do you understand?
30488,Power x And x Games.,102,"I get your point, but..."
30489,Power x And x Games.,102,My life is on the line here.
30490,Power x And x Games.,102,Listen to me.
30491,Power x And x Games.,102,Perfect Plan is not invincible.
30492,Power x And x Games.,102,"In fact, it's highly vulnerable."
30493,Power x And x Games.,102,"I can make people ignore my existence, but I'm still right there in the same place.\NThey just don't notice me."
30494,Power x And x Games.,102,So their attacks can still hit me.
30495,Power x And x Games.,102,"Knowing there's a person around with \Nmy ability, what would someone do?"
30496,Power x And x Games.,102,They'd launch attacks in every direction.
30497,Power x And x Games.,102,"Oh, you're right..."
30498,Power x And x Games.,102,"If one of those attacks hits me, \Neven by dumb luck, I'm done for."
30499,Power x And x Games.,102,"I hate to admit it, but when it comes to combat, \NI'm the weakest Chimera Ant around."
30500,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.
30501,Power x And x Games.,102,Forget the King...
30502,Power x And x Games.,102,I couldn't even survive a punch \Nfrom a Squadron Leader.
30503,Power x And x Games.,102,En{\i0
30504,Power x And x Games.,102,"It's been tested, so the other \NSquadron Leaders know this, too."
30505,Power x And x Games.,102,I need my enemies to believe \Nmy power to be weak.
30506,Power x And x Games.,102,En{\i0
30507,Power x And x Games.,102,This ability is only invincible \Nif no one knows about it.
30508,Power x And x Games.,102,Enough explaining...
30509,Power x And x Games.,102,My point is that I don't want to \Nreveal my power to any others!
30510,Power x And x Games.,102,Not even if it's someone you trust.
30511,Power x And x Games.,102,"You can see for yourself, then."
30512,Power x And x Games.,102,I'll call him out here without mentioning you.
30513,Power x And x Games.,102,W-Wait...
30514,Power x And x Games.,102,You can watch from a distance.
30515,Power x And x Games.,102,Hello—
30516,Power x And x Games.,102,"Yo! I've been waiting, fool!"
30517,Power x And x Games.,102,You pulled a fast one! Where are you?
30518,Power x And x Games.,102,I've got lots of questions for you.
30519,Power x And x Games.,102,"Because of you kids, the boss \Nhad to make a move..."
30520,Power x And x Games.,102,"The plan's been derailed, \Nbut I support what you're doing."
30521,Power x And x Games.,102,Letting five million die isn't right.
30522,Power x And x Games.,102,The boss used his power to surround the capital.
30523,Power x And x Games.,102,Really?
30524,Power x And x Games.,102,That should make it harder for Neferpitou \Nto control puppets remotely.
30525,Power x And x Games.,102,"In other words, they can't perform \Nthe selection from a distance."
30526,Power x And x Games.,102,Right.
30527,Power x And x Games.,102,But the boss and Knov-san will be expending \Nall their energy to delay Neferpitou.
30528,Power x And x Games.,102,"Which means, when the operation starts, they won't be in any condition to \Ntake on any of the Royal Guard."
30529,Power x And x Games.,102,We expect more citizens to gather \Nin the capital for the celebration.
30530,Power x And x Games.,102,There may be a massacre yet.
30531,Power x And x Games.,102,The situation's still grim...
30532,Power x And x Games.,102,We can no longer contact the Chairman.
30533,Power x And x Games.,102,"He's holed up somewhere until the last \Npossible minute, preparing for the final battle."
30534,Power x And x Games.,102,We four need to make a decision.
30535,Power x And x Games.,102,"Do we summon reinforcements, or do we \Nface the three Royal Guards by ourselves?"
30536,Power x And x Games.,102,I'd like to know Killua's opinion.
30537,Power x And x Games.,102,He isn't here.
30538,Power x And x Games.,102,What? You split up?
30539,Power x And x Games.,102,I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.
30540,Power x And x Games.,102,Can you call him real quick?
30541,Power x And x Games.,102,No luck. He isn't picking up...
30542,Power x And x Games.,102,I think his is off.
30543,Power x And x Games.,102,"Really? Well, keep trying."
30544,Power x And x Games.,102,"We should meet up, the sooner the better."
30545,Power x And x Games.,102,Yeah.
30546,Power x And x Games.,102,Let's find a halfway point to meet.
30547,Power x And x Games.,102,Here... Mandai City.
30548,Power x And x Games.,102,"Okay, got it."
30549,Power x And x Games.,102,Checkmate.
30550,Power x And x Games.,102,You're done.
30551,Power x And x Games.,102,Why didn't you resign?
30552,Power x And x Games.,102,Don't make me repeat myself.
30553,Power x And x Games.,102,The match ended twenty-two moves ago.
30554,Power x And x Games.,102,Why did you not resign then?
30555,Power x And x Games.,102,Did you believe I would make a mistake?
30556,Power x And x Games.,102,Idiot.
30557,Power x And x Games.,102,"Next, we have the national Go champion."
30558,Power x And x Games.,102,Give me the rulebook.
30559,Power x And x Games.,102,"It may look simple at first, \Nbut it is a complex game."
30560,Power x And x Games.,102,It may take more time to learn than shogi.
30561,Power x And x Games.,102,Please let me leave!
30562,Power x And x Games.,102,What do you want?
30563,Power x And x Games.,102,Someone! Help me!
30564,Power x And x Games.,102,My glasses...
30565,Power x And x Games.,102,Silence.
30566,Power x And x Games.,102,You are in the King's presence.
30567,Power x And x Games.,102,The choice is yours.
30568,Power x And x Games.,102,Sit across from me now.
30569,Power x And x Games.,102,Or die.
30570,Power x And x Games.,102,5.5 points.
30571,Power x And x Games.,102,The King wins.
30572,Power x And x Games.,102,I-It only took him ten games?
30573,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm t-tired!
30574,Power x And x Games.,102,It's the only explanation for that loss!
30575,Power x And x Games.,102,And I think I have a fever.
30576,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm short on sleep.
30577,Power x And x Games.,102,And I feel dizzy...
30578,Power x And x Games.,102,I'll give you eight hours.
30579,Power x And x Games.,102,And any medicine you need.
30580,Power x And x Games.,102,I expect you to be in top condition.
30581,Power x And x Games.,102,"Should you lose again, I won't \Nbe interested in excuses."
30582,Power x And x Games.,102,Rest as if your life depends on it.
30583,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm impressed by how quickly \Nyou learn these games.
30584,Power x And x Games.,102,I can't believe it took less than half \Nthe time you spent mastering shogi.
30585,Power x And x Games.,102,It's all about learning the feel.
30586,Power x And x Games.,102,"Chess, Go, shogi..."
30587,Power x And x Games.,102,"They have different rules, but all three have a certain rhythm to their moves."
30588,Power x And x Games.,102,That means disrupting your \Nopponent's rhythm is crucial.
30589,Power x And x Games.,102,"Once you've learned the openings, \Nyou can deduce your opponent's rhythm."
30590,Power x And x Games.,102,"Once you know their rhythm, \Nyou need only disrupt it."
30591,Power x And x Games.,102,A psychological principle that \Nwould apply to any contest.
30592,Power x And x Games.,102,"If you've already reached that conclusion, \NI don't see the benefit of playing more games."
30593,Power x And x Games.,102,I believe they will only bore you.
30594,Power x And x Games.,102,How many remain?
30595,Power x And x Games.,102,This country has one more professional game.
30596,Power x And x Games.,102,It's a board game called Gungi.
30597,Power x And x Games.,102,Gungi?
30598,Power x And x Games.,102,"The game originated in East Gorteau, and nearly all citizens know how to play."
30599,Power x And x Games.,102,Give me the rulebook.
30600,Power x And x Games.,102,"As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king."
30601,Power x And x Games.,102,But you can stack up to three pieces.
30602,Power x And x Games.,102,"At the start, you may also freely place \Nyour pieces within your own area."
30603,Power x And x Games.,102,The game has a different feel due to the addition of a third dimension.
30604,Power x And x Games.,102,"For the past fifteen years, \Nthere have been world tournaments, and East Gorteau has yet to lose."
30605,Power x And x Games.,102,"Currently, they're on their third representative, \Na five-time reigning champion."
30606,Power x And x Games.,102,"Then, if I defeat this champion, \NI'll be the best in the world?"
30607,Power x And x Games.,102,A fitting way to end this recreation.
30608,Power x And x Games.,102,Bring them in.
30609,Power x And x Games.,102,There are six days until the selection.
30610,Power x And x Games.,102,The King has no idea how this girl is about to influence his fate.
30611,Power x And x Games.,102,Next time: Check x And x Mate.
30612,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm Gon.
30613,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm Gillua.
30614,Power x And x Games.,102,Did you change your name?
30615,Power x And x Games.,102,No way.
30616,Power x And x Games.,102,Say it again.
30617,Power x And x Games.,102,I'm Gillua!
30618,Power x And x Games.,102,GG!
30619,Check x And x Mate.,103,Gungi?
30620,Check x And x Mate.,103,"For the past fifteen years, \Nthere have been world tournaments, and East Gorteau has yet to lose."
30621,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Currently, they're on their third representative, \Na five-time reigning champion."
30622,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Then, if I defeat this champion, \NI'll be the best in the world?"
30623,Check x And x Mate.,103,A fitting way to end this recreation.
30624,Check x And x Mate.,103,Bring them in.
30625,Check x And x Mate.,103,Check x And x Mate
30626,Check x And x Mate.,103,Six days remain before \NNeferpitou begins the selection.
30627,Check x And x Mate.,103,"The King has spent this time in his palace, defeating the masters of shogi, \NGo, and other board games."
30628,Check x And x Mate.,103,"The last remaining one, \Nthe reigning Gungi world champion, has just been summoned to his side."
30629,Check x And x Mate.,103,U-Um...
30630,Check x And x Mate.,103,Th-Thank you for infighting me—
30631,Check x And x Mate.,103,For inciting me...
30632,Check x And x Mate.,103,No need for small talk.
30633,Check x And x Mate.,103,You and I will play Gungi.
30634,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Right now, I am learning the \Nrules, so you must wait."
30635,Check x And x Mate.,103,Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.
30636,Check x And x Mate.,103,He's dead.
30637,Check x And x Mate.,103,Now I am the King.
30638,Check x And x Mate.,103,I'm s-so sorry!
30639,Check x And x Mate.,103,Please forgive me!
30640,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I'm only a fool, one who knows \Nnothing of the outside world!"
30641,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can't even talk normally...
30642,Check x And x Mate.,103,You are distracting me. Be silent.
30643,Check x And x Mate.,103,Or I'll kill you.
30644,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Okay, I basically understand."
30645,Check x And x Mate.,103,Let us begin.
30646,Check x And x Mate.,103,What's wrong?
30647,Check x And x Mate.,103,It appears she's passed out.
30648,Check x And x Mate.,103,"After you told her to be quiet, \Nshe shut her mouth..."
30649,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Then, since her nose was stuffed up, \Nit seems she was unable to breathe."
30650,Check x And x Mate.,103,This is an uncommonly stupid girl.
30651,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Yeah, that was embarrassing!"
30652,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can't even do things a baby can.
30653,Check x And x Mate.,103,My parents are always yelling at me...
30654,Check x And x Mate.,103,Just play the game.
30655,Check x And x Mate.,103,Yes!
30656,Check x And x Mate.,103,I'm honored to play against you.
30657,Check x And x Mate.,103,You can see with your eyes?
30658,Check x And x Mate.,103,"No, I can't see a thing."
30659,Check x And x Mate.,103,So would you please tell me your moves?
30660,Check x And x Mate.,103,I only open them when I play.
30661,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If it bothers you, I can try to close them..."
30662,Check x And x Mate.,103,I don't care.
30663,Check x And x Mate.,103,The atmosphere has changed.
30664,Check x And x Mate.,103,"4-4-1, pawn."
30665,Check x And x Mate.,103,You can't reach him at all?
30666,Check x And x Mate.,103,"No, I guess his phone is off."
30667,Check x And x Mate.,103,"We agreed that he would initiate all contact, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
30668,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?"
30669,Check x And x Mate.,103,Why does that guy look like he \Nwas born in the wrong decade?
30670,Check x And x Mate.,103,And the look on his face says \Nhe's always looking for a fight...
30671,Check x And x Mate.,103,"The other has no eyebrows, and that expression makes it \Nclear that he trusts no one."
30672,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's not even a question of \Nwhether he and I can get along.
30673,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can already see he won't believe a word I say.
30674,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Gon, I'm sorry to say that my \Nfirst impression is very bad!"
30675,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Unless I get some really good news soon, there's no way I'll be able to trust them."
30676,Check x And x Mate.,103,I guarantee it.
30677,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Hey, what's all this?"
30678,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess."
30679,Check x And x Mate.,103,They have collars...
30680,Check x And x Mate.,103,He's been feeding all the animals \Nleft behind due to the selection.
30681,Check x And x Mate.,103,He's even sacrificed sleep...
30682,Check x And x Mate.,103,I'm not feeding all of them!
30683,Check x And x Mate.,103,I know we don't have time to waste on that!
30684,Check x And x Mate.,103,So I abandoned those that stood no chance.
30685,Check x And x Mate.,103,"That's efficient, yeah?"
30686,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Some were just skin and bones, \Nbut still wouldn't take my food."
30687,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave \Ntheir homes after I untied them..."
30688,Check x And x Mate.,103,What's so bad about saving \Nthe ones that want the help?!
30689,Check x And x Mate.,103,You don't have to cry about it.
30690,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I'm n-not crying, fool!"
30691,Check x And x Mate.,103,Want me to smack you?
30692,Check x And x Mate.,103,That won't be enough to raise my opinion.
30693,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Well, he certainly is different, though."
30694,Check x And x Mate.,103,"7-8-2, spy."
30695,Check x And x Mate.,103,Checkmate.
30696,Check x And x Mate.,103,"She's using an orthodox approach, \Nstacking archers on her pawns."
30697,Check x And x Mate.,103,A standard strategy.
30698,Check x And x Mate.,103,Textbook execution.
30699,Check x And x Mate.,103,And her initial placement \Nis one used with beginners.
30700,Check x And x Mate.,103,Meaning that I am not good enough \Nfor her to show her true skill.
30701,Check x And x Mate.,103,Another game.
30702,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Yes, absolutely!"
30703,Check x And x Mate.,103,"8-8-1, knight."
30704,Check x And x Mate.,103,I guess that's checkmate.
30705,Check x And x Mate.,103,"You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader."
30706,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I'll have to step up my game, \Nor you'll get the jump on me!"
30707,Check x And x Mate.,103,That's enough... Go get some rest.
30708,Check x And x Mate.,103,That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.
30709,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can play Gungi for three days \Nand nights without sleep!
30710,Check x And x Mate.,103,I have another guest.
30711,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn."
30712,Check x And x Mate.,103,Then I'll get a little rest.
30713,Check x And x Mate.,103,What do you think?
30714,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's but a matter of time.
30715,Check x And x Mate.,103,"There are more options to choose from, but essentially, this game is \Nno different than the rest."
30716,Check x And x Mate.,103,"In four or five more games, she will \Nhave to use her real ability."
30717,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Once that happens, I shall be \Nable to observe her rhythm."
30718,Check x And x Mate.,103,Nothing has changed.
30719,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Your Majesty, the Go player hanged himself."
30720,Check x And x Mate.,103,Bring that idiot back.
30721,Check x And x Mate.,103,"While the King continues to play \Nagainst the Gungi master, a short distance away, Morel has \Nbeen using his power to surround the capital city of Peijing."
30722,Check x And x Mate.,103,Purple Haze Soldiers \NDeep Purple
30723,Check x And x Mate.,103,Deep Purple.
30724,Check x And x Mate.,103,"First, he releases the aura that serves as a core."
30725,Check x And x Mate.,103,"He then envelops it in an aura haze,"
30726,Check x And x Mate.,103,Nen{\i0
30727,Check x And x Mate.,103,His ability can sustain two hundred \Nand sixteen puppets at once.
30728,Check x And x Mate.,103,"On the chance that the enemy retaliates, \NI've made my soldiers more responsive, so I can only maintain fifty now."
30729,Check x And x Mate.,103,But they're much stronger.
30730,Check x And x Mate.,103,En{\i1 between one of these and a human.
30731,Check x And x Mate.,103,"But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants."
30732,Check x And x Mate.,103,So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.
30733,Check x And x Mate.,103,"As expected, Neferpitou has recalled \Nthe controlled humans to the capital to take up defensive positions."
30734,Check x And x Mate.,103,That implies the King's safety is top priority.
30735,Check x And x Mate.,103,Which means that restricting the movement \Nof the Royal Guard is very easy.
30736,Check x And x Mate.,103,"However, the question is how the King will respond."
30737,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If we're dealing with a King who does as he \Nlikes, it'll be harder to anticipate him."
30738,Check x And x Mate.,103,And the risk of miscalculation increases.
30739,Check x And x Mate.,103,"But as long as they keep \Nthese coming, we're fine."
30740,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Long time, no see."
30741,Check x And x Mate.,103,I've been looking for you.
30742,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Bah, he's gotten stronger."
30743,Check x And x Mate.,103,The air about him feels totally different.
30744,Check x And x Mate.,103,Knuckle's APR is gone?
30745,Check x And x Mate.,103,"It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either."
30746,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If something had happened, \NKnuckle's group would have contacted me."
30747,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If APR is gone, they have someone who can dispel{\i0"
30748,Check x And x Mate.,103,Or did he do it himself?
30749,Check x And x Mate.,103,Let's see what they can do.
30750,Check x And x Mate.,103,Whichever wins...
30751,Check x And x Mate.,103,"In the end,"
30752,Check x And x Mate.,103,I will triumph.
30753,Check x And x Mate.,103,Time to return the favor.
30754,Check x And x Mate.,103,"First, I'll beat you down."
30755,Check x And x Mate.,103,Then it's the pompadour's turn.
30756,Check x And x Mate.,103,His confidence is far from baseless.
30757,Check x And x Mate.,103,He must have gained a new ability.
30758,Check x And x Mate.,103,I wouldn't be so certain!
30759,Check x And x Mate.,103,If that ability is to exorcise{\i0
30760,Check x And x Mate.,103,Knuckle and Shoot both use \Nhit-and-fade fighting styles.
30761,Check x And x Mate.,103,Shoot does what he can to support \NKnuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
30762,Check x And x Mate.,103,But we can't nullify their{\i0 if they have someone who can dispel it.
30763,Check x And x Mate.,103,A strategy that might have worked \Nagainst the King is useless now.
30764,Check x And x Mate.,103,However... if he has the ability to exorcise{\i0
30765,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If I neutralize him here, Knuckle \Nand Shoot can use their powers."
30766,Check x And x Mate.,103,I must fight...
30767,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have \Nto get by on my remaining aura."
30768,Check x And x Mate.,103,What?
30769,Check x And x Mate.,103,He's still relying on speed?
30770,Check x And x Mate.,103,There are plenty of ways to deal with \Nsomeone who only uses speed.
30771,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Now you're ""It."""
30772,Check x And x Mate.,103,Huh? What was that?
30773,Check x And x Mate.,103,Wh-Where am I?
30774,Check x And x Mate.,103,A savannah?
30775,Check x And x Mate.,103,Did he teleport me?
30776,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If this is his new ability, a different Chimera Ant is the{\i0"
30777,Check x And x Mate.,103,That's bad.
30778,Check x And x Mate.,103,Sure you should just be standing around?
30779,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's time to start this game of tag.
30780,Check x And x Mate.,103,Tag?
30781,Check x And x Mate.,103,We're in a field that I created.
30782,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Unless you touch me, you can't leave."
30783,Check x And x Mate.,103,Your time limit is eight hours.
30784,Check x And x Mate.,103,Let's start!
30785,Check x And x Mate.,103,Hey!
30786,Check x And x Mate.,103,Didn't you hear what I said?
30787,Check x And x Mate.,103,You can't leave without touching me!
30788,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If I chase you, I'll never catch you."
30789,Check x And x Mate.,103,So I'm going to take my time.
30790,Check x And x Mate.,103,Morel disappeared with the enemy!
30791,Check x And x Mate.,103,Cheetu has activated his power...
30792,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I don't know what it does, but they \Nwon't be back for eight hours."
30793,Check x And x Mate.,103,The scenery is just a wall.
30794,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Looks like I'm in some kind of space \Nseparated from the real world, like he said."
30795,Check x And x Mate.,103,Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.
30796,Check x And x Mate.,103,"If I stopped Deep Purple, I could \Nbreak out of here with ease."
30797,Check x And x Mate.,103,However...
30798,Check x And x Mate.,103,"First, is it even possible for me to stop \NDeep Purple from within this space?"
30799,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Second, if I'm able to stop it, will that aura return to me here, in this space?"
30800,Check x And x Mate.,103,"The worst scenario would be one \Nin which I stop Deep Purple, but the aura can't reach me in this space."
30801,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Once Deep Purple is halted, it can't be reactivated until \NI've recovered the aura."
30802,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's too risky to try.
30803,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can't stop Deep Purple.
30804,Check x And x Mate.,103,"At least, not yet."
30805,Check x And x Mate.,103,Are you finally ready to start?
30806,Check x And x Mate.,103,This way! Follow my lead!
30807,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Hold on, you aren't gonna..."
30808,Check x And x Mate.,103,You bet I am!
30809,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's a waste of time.
30810,Check x And x Mate.,103,You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.
30811,Check x And x Mate.,103,There's only one way out.
30812,Check x And x Mate.,103,And that's to catch me.
30813,Check x And x Mate.,103,I can tell that
30814,Check x And x Mate.,103,Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \Nhas weakened his power...
30815,Check x And x Mate.,103,So then...
30816,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Hey, what happens if I don't touch \Nyou within the time limit?"
30817,Check x And x Mate.,103,Who knows?
30818,Check x And x Mate.,103,I have no obligation to answer that question.
30819,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Naturally, of course not."
30820,Check x And x Mate.,103,It appears there's more to this ability.
30821,Check x And x Mate.,103,"I'm in for the long haul, then."
30822,Check x And x Mate.,103,Wake me up in five hours.
30823,Check x And x Mate.,103,Are you mocking me?
30824,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Go ahead, lose your temper."
30825,Check x And x Mate.,103,It seems you don't understand your own power.
30826,Check x And x Mate.,103,This isn't a battle of speed.
30827,Check x And x Mate.,103,It's a battle of mental fortitude.
30828,Check x And x Mate.,103,Deep Purple is still active...
30829,Check x And x Mate.,103,So the operation continues.
30830,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy."
30831,Check x And x Mate.,103,"It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses."
30832,Check x And x Mate.,103,Anyone else around?
30833,Check x And x Mate.,103,"No, just the figures in white."
30834,Check x And x Mate.,103,Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.
30835,Check x And x Mate.,103,But it's possible that the true leader \Nis concealed among them.
30836,Check x And x Mate.,103,And I can't let anyone see my power.
30837,Check x And x Mate.,103,Nen{\i1
30838,Check x And x Mate.,103,Damn...
30839,Check x And x Mate.,103,I need at least two more pawns!
30840,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him."
30841,Check x And x Mate.,103,The King is nearly finished playing games.
30842,Check x And x Mate.,103,"After that, the King will insist on \Ndefeating his enemies himself."
30843,Check x And x Mate.,103,"We will be there to guard him, but \Nyou never know what might happen..."
30844,Check x And x Mate.,103,We would rather the King remain \Ninside until the selection is over.
30845,Check x And x Mate.,103,Do you need something?
30846,Check x And x Mate.,103,Give Leol a hand.
30847,Check x And x Mate.,103,"Yes, as you wish."
30848,Check x And x Mate.,103,Well?
30849,Check x And x Mate.,103,I am becoming worried.
30850,Check x And x Mate.,103,"They've played many times, but \Nthe King is nowhere near victory."
30851,Check x And x Mate.,103,This player is a true master...
30852,Check x And x Mate.,103,I should have been able to break \Nher defenses from the left side.
30853,Check x And x Mate.,103,But she used a peculiar move \Nsequence to turn the tables.
30854,Check x And x Mate.,103,"4-5-1, musketeer."
30855,Check x And x Mate.,103,"2-8-2, fortress."
30856,Check x And x Mate.,103,What?
30857,Check x And x Mate.,103,The spy has done nothing this entire match...
30858,Check x And x Mate.,103,"But suddenly, it controls the board!"
30859,Check x And x Mate.,103,My right side's been destroyed.
30860,Check x And x Mate.,103,I'm done. That's checkmate.
30861,Check x And x Mate.,103,Impossible.
30862,Check x And x Mate.,103,"From start to checkmate, there were \None hundred, forty-four moves."
30863,Check x And x Mate.,103,This outcome could have only happened \Nif she foresaw each of my moves.
30864,Check x And x Mate.,103,On to the next game.
30865,Check x And x Mate.,103,Yes!
30866,Check x And x Mate.,103,This is utterly impossible!
30867,Check x And x Mate.,103,A storm is brewing.
30868,Check x And x Mate.,103,The girl's strength upsets the King.
30869,Check x And x Mate.,103,And a storm draws near the palace.
30870,Check x And x Mate.,103,Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.
30871,Check x And x Mate.,103,Please go easy on us.
30872,Check x And x Mate.,103,Clack.
30873,Check x And x Mate.,103,Whack.
30874,Check x And x Mate.,103,Whoosh.
30875,Check x And x Mate.,103,Clang.
30876,Check x And x Mate.,103,Checkmate.
30877,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,How many are there?
30878,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Around five thousand.
30879,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.
30880,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The King must be angry about that.
30881,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,No...
30882,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Apparently, he's been playing games in his room."
30883,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"He's so obsessed with Gungi, \Nhe's been skipping meals."
30884,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Then what about all this food?
30885,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Should we take it for ourselves?
30886,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You want to take on the King \Nand his Royal Guard?
30887,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Don't make me laugh.
30888,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Yeah...
30889,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone \Nis until you have enough strength yourself."
30890,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,They're monsters. I'll do as they say.
30891,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"When Shaia-dono gave us our powers, he'd probably anticipated that \Nthings would turn out this way."
30892,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!
30893,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If you call him by his old name, he gets mad."
30894,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Doubt x And x Hesitation
30895,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The suit with the glasses is keeping \Na careful watch on his surroundings while heading toward the palace.
30896,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The puppets are useless against him.
30897,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He's strong.
30898,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,What about his abilities?
30899,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Like the others, he has used \Nonly physical attacks thus far."
30900,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Okay, let me know if he shows his power."
30901,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Once Welfin and Brovada arrive, \Nwe'll take care of those figures in white."
30902,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I can also check out the \Npowers those two have.
30903,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Damn, I lost sight of him!"
30904,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Leol-sama, it appears that the suit \Nwith glasses is able to teleport."
30905,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.
30906,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex \NHide and Seek
30907,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It allows him to teleport.
30908,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Nen{\i0
30909,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He is able to transport people \Nand objects through that portal.
30910,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Nen{\i0
30911,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Each room is isolated.
30912,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"The entrance shuts when anyone enters, so to return to the real world, \None must exit by a different door."
30913,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It is possible to create multiple entrances.
30914,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The number of possible entrances differs \Ndepending on the size of the room.
30915,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.
30916,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"So, as a general rule, one can only enter \Nand exit via the location of the entry portal."
30917,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"However, using Knov's master key, an exit can be linked to any portal."
30918,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Nothing out of place.
30919,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Still quiet on the battlefront.
30920,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Morel's Deep Purple is used for \Nprimarily defensive purposes.
30921,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If a puppet encounters someone who \Nisn't an ally, it will keep its distance."
30922,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If it comes under attack, it will \Nretreat, while fighting back."
30923,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The puppets fight back by throwing \Nnearby objects at the enemy.
30924,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"They avoid direct contact,"
30925,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Nen{\i0
30926,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That's a Chimera...
30927,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,What is it doing?
30928,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,We're pretty far from the battlefield.
30929,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Is it scouting the area?
30930,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,There were strange dragonflies around town.
30931,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Nen{\i1
30932,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's very likely...
30933,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in \Ngathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!"
30934,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The battle is on.
30935,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Hey... Hey!
30936,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Aren't you gonna touch me?
30937,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Look how close I am...
30938,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I know you're awake.
30939,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Whoa, there!"
30940,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I knew you were faking it.
30941,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You can't trick me!
30942,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!"
30943,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Give me some peace and quiet!
30944,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,No way!
30945,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I won't let you get any sleep!
30946,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'll keep making noise until you chase me!
30947,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Idiot...
30948,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If that's what you wanted, \Nyou should have set a rule to force people to keep chasing you."
30949,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Looks like he's still getting \Nused to his new power...
30950,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Have it your way.
30951,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I won't be getting up for the next five hours.
30952,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He's really focused on making \Nthis a contest of speed.
30953,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Coupled with his constant need for attention, it's unlikely that he'll settle for \Nany other type of contest."
30954,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm not gonna let you sleep!
30955,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Hey! Over here!
30956,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm within reach...
30957,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Get up!
30958,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Look how close I am.
30959,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's just a waiting game.
30960,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,If he gives up and moves away...
30961,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I win.
30962,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"9-9-1, marshal."
30963,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"1-5-1, marshal."
30964,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"7-9-1, pawn."
30965,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"2-3-1, pawn."
30966,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"8-1-1, spy."
30967,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"2-3-1, cannon."
30968,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"9-1-1, fortress."
30969,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"2-7-2, musketeer."
30970,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The marshal has been isolated...
30971,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"I'll call this ""remote concealment."""
30972,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"7-1-2, fortress."
30973,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"1-6-2, general."
30974,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"9-1-3, archer."
30975,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"3-2-2, major general."
30976,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm done.
30977,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Her initial placement was exactly as expected.
30978,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,She's shifting toward my marshal \Nwithout breaking her crane formation.
30979,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Let us begin, then."
30980,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Her first move will be to position \Nher archer on her right flank.
30981,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,She'll probably try a three-pronged \Nattack to end it quickly.
30982,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But shifting her pieces to the right \Nexposes her left flank to attack.
30983,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's time to disrupt your rhythm.
30984,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"1-9-3, new archer."
30985,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,There it is.
30986,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"9-7-1, new spy."
30987,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"2-9-1, knight."
30988,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Her three-pronged attack \Nand left flank movement will cost me two pieces.
30989,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But that created an opening in her left flank.
30990,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,She'll probably expect me to \Ngo all-in from that side.
30991,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But I won't!
30992,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Here it is!
30993,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"5-5-1, lieutenant general."
30994,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Each of her moves has followed \Na set rhythm until just now, when she froze."
30995,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Given the current placement,"
30996,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I can attack through the \Ncenter in unlimited ways.
30997,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,There is no best move.
30998,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"With every turn, I have the \Nability to extend the match."
30999,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Now, let me hear you squeal!"
31000,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"9-2-1, new lieutenant general."
31001,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That's checkmate.
31002,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You knew my strategy was a dead end.
31003,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Dead End
31004,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Yes.
31005,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Why did you need to think \Nbefore making your move?
31006,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You could have made that move at once.
31007,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The King has moved this match off the board.
31008,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,A wrong answer could mean her death.
31009,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Your ""remote concealment"" strategy is actually named ""kokoriko."""
31010,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I came up with that strategy... ten years ago.
31011,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Placing the lieutenant general in the center to counter a three-pronged attack is also a\N move I devised, called ""general in the middle."""
31012,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"At the time, both drew a lot of attention."
31013,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle \Nwas a popular transition that tested both players' ability to read their opponents.
31014,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I was pretty happy that a fool like me could figure \Nout a smart strategy...
31015,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"But then, I saw how to defeat it."
31016,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"A year after I came up with kokoriko, an opponent used it against me \Nin the national tournament, and I figured out how to counter it."
31017,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"I won the match, but the strategy disappeared from \Nofficial matches and textbooks."
31018,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That the Supreme Leader thought \Nof the same strategy as I had...
31019,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"I was so honored, and touched...\NMy heart trembled."
31020,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It felt like...
31021,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Like seeing my child brought back to life.
31022,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That was how it felt.
31023,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,So it was difficult for me \Nto take that life again.
31024,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That was why
31025,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I hesitated.
31026,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Foolishness.
31027,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I've had enough.
31028,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Get some rest.
31029,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Once we begin again, you won't get any more breaks."
31030,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Be prepared!
31031,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Y-Yes...
31032,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I believe this is the first time the King has ever listened \Nto anyone speak for such a long time.
31033,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Well, it should have no significance..."
31034,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Four hours have passed?
31035,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He got bored and started reading...
31036,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That guy's too easy to understand.
31037,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Oh, you're ready to start?"
31038,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Has it already been five hours?
31039,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Wait, it's only half full."
31040,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Are you getting worried?
31041,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You just noticed?
31042,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,We aren't starting now.
31043,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's already over.
31044,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Look at your ankle.
31045,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,A rope of smoke?
31046,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That took a lot of effort...
31047,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"I had to go all the way around \Nso you wouldn't notice, so it turned into quite a long rope."
31048,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"In any case, all that's left \Nis to wind up the rope."
31049,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Now it's only a matter of time.
31050,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Your turn to try whatever you can.
31051,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But it won't work.
31052,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You should take the smoke seriously.
31053,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed."
31054,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You can struggle all you want.
31055,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I knew it...
31056,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He won't attack me because \Nthis is a game of tag.
31057,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If I touch his body, it will break his ability."
31058,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"He has no patience, but he chose \Nfor the game to last eight hours."
31059,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.
31060,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,The pressure's on you.
31061,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.
31062,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"With his back against the wall, \Ndesperate for a way out..."
31063,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He created a new ability.
31064,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,A crossbow and claws.
31065,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,He can fight at any range.
31066,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Thanks!
31067,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You helped me gain an awesome new power!
31068,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Hey, do you know what this is?"
31069,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's a bow. A bow!
31070,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You sure you want to come closer?!
31071,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,There!
31072,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm quite sure.
31073,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Why would you want a power \Nthat's slower than you are?
31074,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Ah.
31075,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Why don't you try those claws?
31076,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Then I won't have to walk over.
31077,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'll tell you why you lost.
31078,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's because you're an idiot.
31079,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Die!
31080,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Then you can never touch me!
31081,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,This sensation...
31082,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It can't be...
31083,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Smoke?
31084,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,No way!
31085,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Caught you.
31086,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Wh-When did you...
31087,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"While you were reading manga \Nand laughing like a fool,"
31088,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I created a copy of myself from smoke.
31089,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,And I covered myself with smoke \Nthat looked like grass.
31090,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"My copy went one way, and I went the other."
31091,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"The fight continues, even while one sleeps."
31092,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You shouldn't have looked away.
31093,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Looks like we're back...
31094,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Well, do you still want to fight?"
31095,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"No, I've had enough."
31096,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That's a wise decision...
31097,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Then why not tell me what would have happened \Nif I hadn't caught you?
31098,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,There's no point in asking.
31099,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Once I've been caught, \NI can't use that power anymore."
31100,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,That was the condition I set.
31101,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Really? I feel bad...
31102,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's no big deal.
31103,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!
31104,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Next time, I won't lose."
31105,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You'd better be ready!
31106,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"His superior is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia, who has the power to release{\i0"
31107,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"So if the selection is carried out, \Nwinning will become very difficult."
31108,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Gon and Killua made the right choice.
31109,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,We need to meet.
31110,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Let's talk inside.
31111,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Reinforcements have arrived.
31112,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's a crayfish and a wolf.
31113,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Are they strong?
31114,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"If I knew, my job would be easier..."
31115,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength."
31116,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,So it's currently a stalemate.
31117,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out."
31118,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I suspect it's because I took out this one.
31119,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Those dragonflies were acting \Nas security cameras.
31120,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Come in, Flutter!"
31121,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Doesn't seem he's going to show.
31122,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Change in plans!
31123,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Without Flutter, we have no way \Nto know the enemy's location."
31124,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Damn.
31125,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"When it really counts, he lets me down!"
31126,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Should I call it off?
31127,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"No, I can't do that."
31128,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!
31129,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"We're heading back, then."
31130,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Ah, hold on..."
31131,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.
31132,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Rental Pod\NIOU Dispenser
31133,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Is that your power?
31134,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Yeah, I can use it to scout around."
31135,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Don't tell anyone else...
31136,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'm showing you because I trust you.
31137,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth."
31138,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily borrow an ability in exchange \Nfor granting the target a favor.
31139,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"However, two conditions must be met."
31140,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"First, he must have seen the ability or know its name."
31141,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Satellite Dragonflies
31142,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Second, he must grant a favor."
31143,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"After confirming that his favor is not \Nfree and is expected to be repaid, this skill will activate, assuming \Nthe target agrees to his conditions."
31144,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Got it!
31145,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Once all conditions are met, Leol's \Ndispenser automatically stores data, which can be checked at any time."
31146,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"However, if the target dies, \Nthe data will be deleted."
31147,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Flutter's fine.
31148,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I believe there's been no communication because he's unconscious or far away.
31149,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,A rental can be used for one hour.
31150,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"During the rental period, the target \Ncannot use the borrowed power."
31151,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Anyway, Flutter is still alive..."
31152,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.
31153,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies verify the location of the suit \Nwith the glasses, we'll start."
31154,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,So we keep the small fry at a distance \Nwhile you take on the suit with the glasses.
31155,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,You gonna be okay on your own?
31156,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Just trust me. I wouldn't give \Nyou a job you can't handle.
31157,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,And I don't want you to see my power.
31158,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I'll do whatever it takes to \Ncomplete this mission.
31159,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Okay...
31160,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I can't afford to wait around here.
31161,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Not until the King is in my debt!
31162,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and \Ntears it up, the effect activates."
31163,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,They're here.
31164,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Time to start scouting.
31165,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I don't understand.
31166,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,This is upsetting.
31167,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"During our matches, I am the only \None who's getting flustered."
31168,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,I would have expected this to be \Nhumiliating on a new level.
31169,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But...
31170,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"At the same time, I am enjoying our matches."
31171,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,But I don't understand why...
31172,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.
31173,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,"Morel-san, what's in your pipe?"
31174,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,It holds...
31175,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,Gulp.
31176,Doubt x And x Hesitation.,104,...tonkotsu.
31177,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Your ""remote concealment"" strategy is actually named ""kokoriko."""
31178,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I came up with that strategy... ten years ago.
31179,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I was pretty happy that a fool like me could figure \Nout a smart strategy...
31180,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"But then, I saw how to defeat it."
31181,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That the Supreme Leader thought \Nof the same strategy as I had...
31182,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I was so honored and touched... \NMy heart trembled.
31183,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It felt like...
31184,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Like seeing my child brought back to life.
31185,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Foolishness.
31186,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I've had enough.
31187,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Get some rest.
31188,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Once we begin again, you won't get any more breaks."
31189,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Be prepared!
31190,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Resolve x And x Awakening
31191,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,This is upsetting.
31192,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"During our matches, I am the only \None who's getting flustered."
31193,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I would have expected this to be \Nhumiliating on a new level.
31194,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,But...
31195,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"At the same time, I am enjoying our matches."
31196,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,But I don't understand why...
31197,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That I do not understand my own mind upsets me more than words can describe!
31198,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Did she not choose to rest?
31199,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,No...
31200,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Unsightly.
31201,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,No sign of intelligence or dignity.
31202,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,How can such a being boast a Gungi record so stellar \Nthat it could be called the ultimate in game theory?
31203,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Wake up! We're starting again.
31204,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Y-Yes...
31205,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"9-5-1, marshal."
31206,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,For this match...
31207,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Hmm?
31208,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,We should make a wager.
31209,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,A wager?
31210,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Correct.
31211,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If you win, I shall grant \Nany wish you request."
31212,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Any wish I request?
31213,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Any wish...
31214,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,However...
31215,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If you lose,"
31216,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I shall take your left arm.
31217,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Fear and desire hold the power to disrupt one's rhythm.
31218,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Desire clouds vision, while fear stills one's step."
31219,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,My left arm...
31220,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,My left arm...
31221,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Should I do it?!
31222,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Why do you hesitate?
31223,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Well... Instead of my left arm...
31224,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
31225,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,What?
31226,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,What do you bet?
31227,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,My life.
31228,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If I lose, I will offer you my life."
31229,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,But you might consider that an insult...
31230,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I do not understand.
31231,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Explain yourself.
31232,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Um...
31233,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do."
31234,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive."
31235,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"But professional Gungi players, even national champions, make but a pittance."
31236,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Only after you become the world \Nchampion as representative for a nation will you receive any meaningful reward.
31237,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"To become the national representative, \Nyou must win tournaments."
31238,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"In other words, you cannot lose a single match."
31239,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I come from a family of twelve, and in our home, I'm the breadwinner."
31240,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If I lose a single match,"
31241,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I will become the greatest burden on my family.
31242,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Gungi players have a saying...
31243,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"That, after losing once, a Gungi master \Nbecomes a normal person."
31244,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If I lose,"
31245,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I'll be garbage.
31246,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Ah, it doesn't bother me!"
31247,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It's just what my parents always said...
31248,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"So, the day I set my sights on \Nbecoming a professional player,"
31249,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I decided that if I ever lost a match, \NI would take my own life."
31250,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,But that could be a problem...
31251,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,How so?
31252,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"When I lose, I'll become garbage..."
31253,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,And all you'd receive for \Nwinning would be garbage.
31254,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That would be a terrible insult.
31255,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It doesn't bother me.
31256,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I'm more interested in learning \Nwhat you'd want if you win.
31257,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,You see...
31258,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...
31259,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I'll think about it later, after I win."
31260,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Very well.
31261,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?
31262,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Your life, was it?"
31263,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
31264,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I never imagined that, if you won, \Nyou might ask for my life."
31265,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Your Majesty!
31266,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Silence!
31267,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The Supreme Leader's l-li—
31268,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I w-would never ask such a thing!
31269,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The thought never crossed my mind!
31270,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I know that.
31271,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The fault is my own.
31272,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The wager is off.
31273,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It was a petty tactic.
31274,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,No...
31275,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Accept this apology.
31276,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Your Majesty!
31277,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,How could you do that?
31278,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I must treat your arm...
31279,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Come with me!
31280,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Y-Your arm?
31281,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Continue the match.
31282,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Huh? Huh?
31283,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"What happened, Supreme Leader?"
31284,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It's your turn. Make your move.
31285,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!
31286,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Do not make me repeat myself.
31287,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Continue the match.
31288,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It was I who said there would be no more breaks.
31289,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?
31290,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I shall summon Neferpitou.
31291,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I am sure that you can continue to play, as your arm is reattached."
31292,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That is the best compromise I can offer.
31293,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If you refuse to accept it, you may take my head now!"
31294,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Very well.
31295,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Come closer.
31296,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I shall end it with a single strike.
31297,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It's your turn.
31298,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Make your move.
31299,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I refuse.
31300,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I refuse to move before you \Nhave your injury treated.
31301,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Don't make me repeat myself. \NMake your move.
31302,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I refuse.
31303,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If you wish to kill me, use Gungi!"
31304,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Why, you..."
31305,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Summon Pitou!
31306,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,At once!
31307,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,There's no doubt.
31308,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,All the puppets have vanished.
31309,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Have they resumed the selection process?
31310,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"No, I doubt it."
31311,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,We have the capital surrounded.
31312,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The King's safety is their top priority. \NThey wouldn't leave him.
31313,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Then what's going on?
31314,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"My assumption would be that \Nsome threat greater than us has befallen the Royal Guard, \Nor upon the King himself."
31315,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,So this is it?
31316,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Our golden opportunity?
31317,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Yes...
31318,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
31319,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"However, it may be a trap."
31320,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That shouldn't be the case...
31321,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,They wouldn't use any tactic that \Nmight endanger the King.
31322,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,They would if the King ordered it.
31323,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I suppose...
31324,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Regardless, they've retracted \Ntheir long-range radar."
31325,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,We should use this chance to \Nget as close as possible.
31326,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I must create a portal near the palace, or the plan will fail."
31327,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,This dangerous job had to be done eventually.
31328,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,And the time is now.
31329,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,There!
31330,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I found them.
31331,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,It appears Cheetu failed.
31332,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Try not to die.
31333,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Same to you.
31334,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,They've split up for us.
31335,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I found them.
31336,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,We'll switch to the man with the pipe!
31337,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Let's go!
31338,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Doctor Blythe.
31339,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Toy Repair \NDoctor Blythe
31340,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"7-9-1, spy."
31341,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"2-3-1, pawn."
31342,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,How long will the operation take?
31343,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I'd say two or three hours \Nuntil complete recovery.
31344,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,En{\i0
31345,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Nen{\i0
31346,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.
31347,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"While you treat His Majesty, \NI shall watch the surroundings."
31348,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,En{\i0
31349,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Regardless, this is an important task \Nthat I cannot trust to anyone else."
31350,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"As expected, I cannot sense any{\i0"
31351,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The rain helps to lower visibility.
31352,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Soon, the sun will set."
31353,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness."
31354,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,And picking out enemy aura will be easier.
31355,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Be patient.
31356,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"The closer the portal is to \Nthe palace, the better."
31357,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless."
31358,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"While I can enter and exit freely,"
31359,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Shoot and the rest can only use \Nthe portal to leave once they enter.
31360,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit, it will mean serious trouble."
31361,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I must prepare three exits in the area \Naround the palace, one near, one far, and one somewhere in between, then \Nplace entrances even further away."
31362,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"I'll set up the entrances in groups of three, \Nin locations where the palace is within sight."
31363,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"When the mission starts, we can enter \Nby the most convenient location."
31364,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Once it's time to act, the situation will determine \Nwhether we approach by the near exit, the far exit, \Nor the one in between."
31365,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Once that has been determined, we act."
31366,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"From the enemy's perspective, \Nwe will be appearing from nowhere."
31367,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,We must use that opening to separate \Nthe King and Royal Guard.
31368,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,That is when our battles will begin!
31369,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record, so long as the King is their one loss."
31370,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Under normal circumstances,"
31371,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I would already be within \Nrange of Neferpitou's{\i0
31372,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,This is quite tense...
31373,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"However, I am still far away."
31374,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"The farthest exit must be on the palace grounds, \Nor it won't be any use to us!"
31375,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Advance carefully, but swiftly!"
31376,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Should I wait for the sun to set?
31377,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"But, will this scenario hold out until then?"
31378,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I have no choice...
31379,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Should Neferpitou's{\i0 approaching the palace will be impossible.
31380,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"If I fail, we still have other options!"
31381,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I have nothing to fear.
31382,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Advance...
31383,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Advance...
31384,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"In the palace, there are three humans not intended as food."
31385,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The first is the Gungi player.
31386,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The second is Diego.
31387,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,And the third... is Secretary Bizeff.
31388,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Behind the scenes, he was \Nthe country's true ruler."
31389,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,All dealings with foreign parties \Nand domestic organizations went through him as an intermediary.
31390,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Since he cannot be replaced, he is the only human allowed near the King."
31391,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,No human guards are posted near the palace.
31392,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Nen{\i0 the Royal Guard determined that the \Npresence of ordinary soldiers would, in fact, increase the risk of infiltration."
31393,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"The only Squadron Leader present \Nis Cheetu, who has just returned."
31394,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.
31395,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"In other words, there are currently only three humans \Nand eleven Ants in the palace."
31396,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,The Soldier Ants are the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.
31397,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Thus, they are not involved \Nin the King's protection."
31398,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Essentially, the Squadron Leaders no longer have any strict fealty to the King."
31399,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,They work together simply \Nbecause their goals align.
31400,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks \Nthat are expected to end in failure."
31401,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Hence, they would not be trusted \Nwith monitoring the palace."
31402,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"However, Knov does not know this."
31403,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"As he attempts to infiltrate the palace, he has no idea that this is \Nhis best, and last, chance."
31404,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I managed to survive somehow...
31405,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"But on my own, I can only work so much."
31406,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,I must convince them to at least provide three more \Nstaffers to do secretarial duties...
31407,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Otherwise, I'll die of overwork."
31408,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Sending list of available bodies.
31409,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"""Thinker..."
31410,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Bell."""
31411,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Per our arrangement, \NI request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119."
31412,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,This is it.
31413,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"He took the bait, Palm-kun!"
31414,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,"
31415,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Palm is preparing to launch \Nher own infiltration plan.
31416,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Next time: Knov x And x Morel.
31417,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,"Today, this person is joining me!"
31418,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Why am I here?
31419,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Because Killua isn't around!
31420,Resolve x And x Awakening.,105,Scream.
31421,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If you lose,"
31422,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I shall take your left arm.
31423,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Well... Instead of my left arm...
31424,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
31425,Knov x And x Morel.,106,What?
31426,Knov x And x Morel.,106,What do you bet?
31427,Knov x And x Morel.,106,My life.
31428,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Your life, was it?"
31429,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
31430,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Accept this apology.
31431,Knov x And x Morel.,106,So this is it?
31432,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Our golden opportunity?
31433,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Yes...
31434,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
31435,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Knov x And x Morel
31436,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Neferpitou has stopped
31437,Knov x And x Morel.,106,En{\i0
31438,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Knov takes this opportunity \Nto infiltrate the palace.
31439,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Finally, I've gotten this close."
31440,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Still more than one hundred meters \Nto the central stairway.
31441,Knov x And x Morel.,106,These strange trees bear very large fruit.
31442,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Around five hundred per tree...
31443,Knov x And x Morel.,106,And there are ten trees.
31444,Knov x And x Morel.,106,A total of five thousand.
31445,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Five hundred thousand people were to undergo the selection process each day, \Nwith a one-percent survival rate."
31446,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"But thanks to Killua's distractions, \Nthat schedule was only fulfilled on one day, so the numbers add up..."
31447,Knov x And x Morel.,106,These are cocoons holding the \Nhumans who were selected.
31448,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Which means they will become {\i0 turning against the rest of humanity.
31449,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator... and intends to manipulate these \Nsoldiers per the King's will, expanding his conquest throughout the world."
31450,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I will not let that happen!
31451,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"First, the far exit... is set."
31452,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Next...
31453,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I must get closer.
31454,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The palace entrance looks dark...
31455,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"So far, so good..."
31456,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Middle exit... set.
31457,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Now for the near exit.
31458,Knov x And x Morel.,106,There aren't any guards...
31459,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I'd imagine only a select few are inside.
31460,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This will work.
31461,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If I've come this far, \NI can reach the inner palace."
31462,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"The throne room is on the third \Nfloor, at the rear and center."
31463,Knov x And x Morel.,106,King
31464,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"We must delay any reinforcements, \Neven if by only a second."
31465,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Central Stairway
31466,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The first floor is too far for that.
31467,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"The central stairway, second floor."
31468,Knov x And x Morel.,106,That's the best location!
31469,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...
31470,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"To be safe, I'll leave an exit here..."
31471,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"No, that would be no different \Nfrom the one outside..."
31472,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It should at least be next to the first floor's central stairway.
31473,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Then, if I can, I'll go up from \Nthere to the second floor..."
31474,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Window Opener \NScream
31475,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Scream...
31476,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Close!
31477,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Are any others around?
31478,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If I'm seen, it's over."
31479,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I'll have to retreat...
31480,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Nothing's coming?
31481,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Then it was alone?
31482,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This is it.
31483,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I can't move beyond this point...
31484,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If I do, I'll be killed."
31485,Knov x And x Morel.,106,What is that aura?
31486,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It appears to be full of all \Nkinds of misfortune...
31487,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"At this point, I don't fear death."
31488,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"What I fear is that, before killing me, the monsters up there will squeeze every drop of information \Nfrom me that I have on the King..."
31489,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Using any brutal means necessary.
31490,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist..."
31491,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The aura's strength just confirms it...
31492,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This is as far as I go...
31493,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?"
31494,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"My name is Leol, and don't forget it."
31495,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I heard that I should expect \Na crayfish and wolf.
31496,Knov x And x Morel.,106,They're dealing with the grunts you created.
31497,Knov x And x Morel.,106,So I can fight you one-on-one.
31498,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I appreciate that.
31499,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.
31500,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"No, he's a little stronger."
31501,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Let's get started.
31502,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Right now, allowing Knov to get \Ninto the palace is the priority."
31503,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Until that happens, I need to \Ndivert the enemy's attention."
31504,Knov x And x Morel.,106,That won't help.
31505,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This is Marcos.
31506,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Do you have the meat?
31507,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Yes, as requested."
31508,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Refrigerated trucks are entering \Nthe underground warehouse...
31509,Knov x And x Morel.,106,They're shipping in food.
31510,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If the information Marcos \Nprovided was accurate, living women are also inside."
31511,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Not for the King, but for the \Nlecherous Secretary Bizeff."
31512,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If everything is going as planned,"
31513,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Palm should be inside.
31514,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Leave the fourth truck as it is.
31515,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Yes, sir."
31516,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Then we'll be leaving.
31517,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Area D, of the underground warehouse."
31518,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"My very own paradise, where no one can interfere."
31519,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Now, please step out."
31520,Knov x And x Morel.,106,There's nothing to worry about.
31521,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"From now on, you will work here."
31522,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I've prepared rooms for each of you.
31523,Knov x And x Morel.,106,You will be provided with all necessities.
31524,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"In your spare time, you may do as you want."
31525,Knov x And x Morel.,106,As long as you don't attempt to escape.
31526,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Your only job is to follow my orders.
31527,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"When summoned, you must drop everything, and come to see me at once."
31528,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Yes, Mr. Secretary."
31529,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Excellent.
31530,Knov x And x Morel.,106,You...
31531,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Come with me.
31532,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Yes.
31533,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The rest of you can wait in your rooms.
31534,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Yes...
31535,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The Secretary was...
31536,Knov x And x Morel.,106,...interested in us!
31537,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"I must find a way out of here, so I can see the King and his Royal Guard."
31538,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe the current whereabouts of \Nanyone she has seen previously."
31539,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This power will allow her to keep tabs \Non the King and Royal Guard.
31540,Knov x And x Morel.,106,The Hunters will then be able to determine the optimal route for the operation.
31541,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Only one exit.
31542,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.
31543,Knov x And x Morel.,106,My mission is crucial for \Nincreasing our chances of defeating the King!
31544,Knov x And x Morel.,106,What matters most isn't that I succeed...
31545,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"But that, should I fail and be captured, \NI kill myself immediately."
31546,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I should be safe here...
31547,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Palm...
31548,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Don't do anything foolish!
31549,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"I managed to place the exits, so even if your mission doesn't succeed, \Nwe can still execute the operation."
31550,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If you get caught, it's over..."
31551,Knov x And x Morel.,106,That...
31552,Knov x And x Morel.,106,That...
31553,Knov x And x Morel.,106,That vicious aura...
31554,Knov x And x Morel.,106,One look was all it took to break my will...
31555,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Gon... Killua...
31556,Knov x And x Morel.,106,You must have seen that aura...
31557,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"You were probably even closer, \Nactually touching it..."
31558,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Yet...
31559,Knov x And x Morel.,106,How are you still able to face them?
31560,Knov x And x Morel.,106,How can you bring yourself to fight?
31561,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Is it to save your friends?
31562,Knov x And x Morel.,106,To protect humanity?
31563,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Why...
31564,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Why are you still fighting?
31565,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Palm!
31566,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Please...
31567,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Don't do anything foolish.
31568,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I beg you...
31569,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If you're caught, it's all over..."
31570,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Palm!
31571,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I won't be able... to go back there...
31572,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I brought you something cold to drink.
31573,Knov x And x Morel.,106,You're dismissed.
31574,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Wait in your room.
31575,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Yes.
31576,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Your lack of familiarity with the \Narea has sealed your defeat.
31577,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Though it's almost too perfect that, \Nafter all that running, you ended up in an underground church."
31578,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"In case of emergency, this place \Nis used as an air shelter."
31579,Knov x And x Morel.,106,An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.
31580,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Well, you'll have to say your own prayers."
31581,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I'm an atheist.
31582,Knov x And x Morel.,106,You're a cocky guy.
31583,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Let's see who's trapped whom.
31584,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Cheetu told me everything.
31585,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I hear you can mold that \Nsmoke into various objects.
31586,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Knowing that, he still chased me in here?"
31587,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Even better.
31588,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"If he believes things are going his way, he won't hesitate to display his abilities."
31589,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"However,"
31590,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I've yet to meet anyone whose power allows them to react more \Nflexibly than Deep Purple.
31591,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.
31592,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...
31593,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I really dig it.
31594,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It's common sense to defeat an opponent \Nbefore they can use their power.
31595,Knov x And x Morel.,106,But that isn't how men should fight.
31596,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Hey, what are you up to?"
31597,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Voluntarily removing one of your senses?
31598,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Have you heard of the band Black Planet?
31599,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Their second album is super cool.
31600,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It's a twelve-song medley.
31601,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Listening to the whole thing's \Nlike reading a good book.
31602,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"When you finish it, you feel great."
31603,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I know.
31604,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"And best part of all, the medley's \Nexactly sixty minutes long."
31605,Knov x And x Morel.,106,It's a masterpiece!
31606,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"I hate to admit it, but I agree."
31607,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Rental, start!"
31608,Knov x And x Morel.,106,This could be bad...
31609,Knov x And x Morel.,106,I have a hard time fighting others who share my tastes.
31610,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Next time: Return x And x Retire.
31611,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Killua!
31612,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Return on.
31613,Knov x And x Morel.,106,Killua!
31614,Knov x And x Morel.,106,To the next episode preview!
31615,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"It has to be you, Killua!"
31616,Knov x And x Morel.,106,"Hey, stop crying."
31617,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Leol has chased Morel into \Nan underground church, where they will now fight one another."
31618,Return x And x Retire.,107,This ability only activates when it rains.
31619,Return x And x Retire.,107,Inamura!
31620,Return x And x Retire.,107,Return x And x Retire
31621,Return x And x Retire.,107,My Inamura summons waves!
31622,Return x And x Retire.,107,Well? Aren't my big waves rad?
31623,Return x And x Retire.,107,I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!
31624,Return x And x Retire.,107,"You're having trouble moving \Nin the water, right?"
31625,Return x And x Retire.,107,You like how easily my board can maneuver?
31626,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death."
31627,Return x And x Retire.,107,That's not your ability.
31628,Return x And x Retire.,107,It belongs to my buddy!
31629,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Oh, making a boat of smoke?"
31630,Return x And x Retire.,107,So he can stand on that smoke?
31631,Return x And x Retire.,107,You think that's enough to defeat my waves?
31632,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I told you, that's not your ability!"
31633,Return x And x Retire.,107,This one is my own original...
31634,Return x And x Retire.,107,Tornave!
31635,Return x And x Retire.,107,Maelstrom!!\N{\fs20
31636,Return x And x Retire.,107,The current's so strong...
31637,Return x And x Retire.,107,I can't tell up from down.
31638,Return x And x Retire.,107,This is bad.
31639,Return x And x Retire.,107,I can't control my body at all...
31640,Return x And x Retire.,107,I stop my opponent's \Nmovements with a whirlpool.
31641,Return x And x Retire.,107,Here I go!
31642,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!"
31643,Return x And x Retire.,107,"My harpoon can match the speed of sound, and pierce a whale at the very bottom \Nof the ocean, even from the sky!"
31644,Return x And x Retire.,107,Take this!
31645,Return x And x Retire.,107,He disappeared?
31646,Return x And x Retire.,107,Impossible!
31647,Return x And x Retire.,107,The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.
31648,Return x And x Retire.,107,He had no way to escape.
31649,Return x And x Retire.,107,Bastard...
31650,Return x And x Retire.,107,How did you do it?
31651,Return x And x Retire.,107,I simply exhaled.
31652,Return x And x Retire.,107,"When it comes to lung capacity, \Nno one in the world beats me."
31653,Return x And x Retire.,107,He used his breath as jet propulsion \Nto break out of the whirlpool?
31654,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Okay, it's my turn now!"
31655,Return x And x Retire.,107,It's your turn?
31656,Return x And x Retire.,107,"In this battle, you don't get a turn!"
31657,Return x And x Retire.,107,All you get to do is drown in my waves!
31658,Return x And x Retire.,107,"During this exchange, I've learned three things."
31659,Return x And x Retire.,107,"First, I now know your power."
31660,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Somehow, you're able to use \Nother people's abilities."
31661,Return x And x Retire.,107,And those earphones have nothing to do with your power.
31662,Return x And x Retire.,107,They're either for show or for luck.
31663,Return x And x Retire.,107,Or it means someone is sending you orders.
31664,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If he meant to impair his hearing \Nto strengthen his power, he shouldn't be able to hear me talk."
31665,Return x And x Retire.,107,What's the third thing?
31666,Return x And x Retire.,107,Your lifespan.
31667,Return x And x Retire.,107,That Inamura ability belongs \Nto a Hunter named Grachan.
31668,Return x And x Retire.,107,You probably encountered and defeated \Nhim when he was sent to fight the Chimera Ants.
31669,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!
31670,Return x And x Retire.,107,Your life ends today!
31671,Return x And x Retire.,107,Hold on...
31672,Return x And x Retire.,107,That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.
31673,Return x And x Retire.,107,I was protecting myself from humans \Nwho were hunting me down.
31674,Return x And x Retire.,107,It was self-defense.
31675,Return x And x Retire.,107,And I didn't steal his ability.
31676,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'm just borrowing it for a bit.
31677,Return x And x Retire.,107,Just borrowing it for a bit?
31678,Return x And x Retire.,107,That's an excuse thieves use.
31679,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Well, arguing with you is pointless."
31680,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I'd like to get my hands on his ability, but defeating him is more important."
31681,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Right now, our top priority \Nis to defeat one another."
31682,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll repeat myself...
31683,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!"
31684,Return x And x Retire.,107,Big Wall!
31685,Return x And x Retire.,107,Big Wall
31686,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'm flooding this underground church.
31687,Return x And x Retire.,107,My wall of water's gonna suck you in!
31688,Return x And x Retire.,107,Just try and find your way to the surface!
31689,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Now, will he make it up?"
31690,Return x And x Retire.,107,Will I smash his skull with my board?
31691,Return x And x Retire.,107,Launch my harpoon through his gut?
31692,Return x And x Retire.,107,Which do I choose?
31693,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Either way, if he shows his face above water, he's done."
31694,Return x And x Retire.,107,He isn't coming back up...
31695,Return x And x Retire.,107,Has he drowned?
31696,Return x And x Retire.,107,"No, he was confident about his lung capacity."
31697,Return x And x Retire.,107,That means he can survive for \Nten or twenty minutes.
31698,Return x And x Retire.,107,"No, wait."
31699,Return x And x Retire.,107,It's just possible that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!
31700,Return x And x Retire.,107,There you are!
31701,Return x And x Retire.,107,Don't move!
31702,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll impale you with my harpoon.
31703,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Bubbles on the opposite side, too?"
31704,Return x And x Retire.,107,And over here!
31705,Return x And x Retire.,107,And over there!
31706,Return x And x Retire.,107,There are air bubbles everywhere...
31707,Return x And x Retire.,107,I see...
31708,Return x And x Retire.,107,"It's possible, if he formed his smoke \Ninto a hose with multiple branches."
31709,Return x And x Retire.,107,"That way, he wouldn't give away his position."
31710,Return x And x Retire.,107,Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?
31711,Return x And x Retire.,107,Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?
31712,Return x And x Retire.,107,"No, that isn't it!"
31713,Return x And x Retire.,107,The bubbles are camouflage!
31714,Return x And x Retire.,107,Is he running?
31715,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible he could swim out through the maze of \Nunderground corridors leading down here."
31716,Return x And x Retire.,107,I can't let him escape!
31717,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this, \Nso I could take all the credit..."
31718,Return x And x Retire.,107,My head's spinning?
31719,Return x And x Retire.,107,And my chest hurts...
31720,Return x And x Retire.,107,Have I been poisoned?
31721,Return x And x Retire.,107,My board disappeared?
31722,Return x And x Retire.,107,Is it because my physical and \Nmental stability are compromised?
31723,Return x And x Retire.,107,Can't move...
31724,Return x And x Retire.,107,Can't breathe...
31725,Return x And x Retire.,107,"My power stopped working, \Nbut the water hasn't gone away?"
31726,Return x And x Retire.,107,Because we're underground?
31727,Return x And x Retire.,107,Crap...
31728,Return x And x Retire.,107,I let him think he had the advantage \Nso I could turn the tables on him.
31729,Return x And x Retire.,107,But it looks as though the one \Nwho was backed into a corner... was me...
31730,Return x And x Retire.,107,Am I gonna die?
31731,Return x And x Retire.,107,Am I... Am I gonna die here?
31732,Return x And x Retire.,107,So he was using smoke hoses to send air bubbles everywhere.
31733,Return x And x Retire.,107,But what kind of... poison did he use?
31734,Return x And x Retire.,107,That was faster than I expected.
31735,Return x And x Retire.,107,The poison you've inhaled is lethal.
31736,Return x And x Retire.,107,But it's something naturally found in air.
31737,Return x And x Retire.,107,Carbon dioxide.
31738,Return x And x Retire.,107,Carbon Dioxide
31739,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Morel used his immense lung capacity to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church, and exhaled it with an increased \Nconcentration of carbon dioxide."
31740,Return x And x Retire.,107,I started my attack before you ever began.
31741,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If he was telling the truth,"
31742,Return x And x Retire.,107,Grachan should be getting his ability back.
31743,Return x And x Retire.,107,I have a few hours in which to move around.
31744,Return x And x Retire.,107,"During that time, I must see \Nthem with my own eyes!"
31745,Return x And x Retire.,107,I've observed Bizeff's movements \Nwith my crystal ball.
31746,Return x And x Retire.,107,I know how to leave this area.
31747,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped, he can't tell anyone because \Nhe's kept this area a secret."
31748,Return x And x Retire.,107,They are... up above.
31749,Return x And x Retire.,107,I can't go any farther.
31750,Return x And x Retire.,107,But...
31751,Return x And x Retire.,107,Oh? How are you feeling?
31752,Return x And x Retire.,107,Octopus! Where am I?
31753,Return x And x Retire.,107,How long was I out?
31754,Return x And x Retire.,107,Don't call me an octopus!
31755,Return x And x Retire.,107,This is an underground clinic for folks \Nwith roots in the underworld.
31756,Return x And x Retire.,107,You were out for two whole days.
31757,Return x And x Retire.,107,Two days?! I need to get going!
31758,Return x And x Retire.,107,Hey!
31759,Return x And x Retire.,107,You shouldn't move around!
31760,Return x And x Retire.,107,Your wounds will reopen.
31761,Return x And x Retire.,107,I have to follow through with the plan...
31762,Return x And x Retire.,107,Fool!
31763,Return x And x Retire.,107,You were just on the verge of death!
31764,Return x And x Retire.,107,You need a few days before—
31765,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Oh, you're awake?"
31766,Return x And x Retire.,107,That's great.
31767,Return x And x Retire.,107,Thanks for everything you've done.
31768,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'm checking out now.
31769,Return x And x Retire.,107,Not until you pay me.
31770,Return x And x Retire.,107,Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.
31771,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead."
31772,Return x And x Retire.,107,I don't have my wallet on me. \NI'll wire it to you when I get back.
31773,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'm not stupid enough to trust \Nthat you'll keep that promise.
31774,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Until you find someone to bring \Nthe money, you're staying here."
31775,Return x And x Retire.,107,I don't have time for that!
31776,Return x And x Retire.,107,Give me a phone!
31777,Return x And x Retire.,107,"It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute."
31778,Return x And x Retire.,107,Would you just shut up and go away?
31779,Return x And x Retire.,107,Hello?
31780,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Hey, it's me."
31781,Return x And x Retire.,107,Killua!
31782,Return x And x Retire.,107,Where are you? Are you okay?
31783,Return x And x Retire.,107,What happened?
31784,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll explain when I see you.
31785,Return x And x Retire.,107,A strong enemy gave me some trouble.
31786,Return x And x Retire.,107,I've been in the hospital.
31787,Return x And x Retire.,107,Oh...
31788,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Well, I'm glad you called."
31789,Return x And x Retire.,107,"This means you're okay now, right?"
31790,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Yeah, I'll be back soon."
31791,Return x And x Retire.,107,Anything happen on your side?
31792,Return x And x Retire.,107,We've found a strong ally.
31793,Return x And x Retire.,107,He's bonding with Knuckle.
31794,Return x And x Retire.,107,We have a plan that could \Ndefeat the King if it goes well.
31795,Return x And x Retire.,107,Oh...
31796,Return x And x Retire.,107,"We should meet, so I can hear what you think."
31797,Return x And x Retire.,107,Okay.
31798,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Then, I need you to send money \Nto a certain bank account."
31799,Return x And x Retire.,107,"If you do that, we can rendezvous today."
31800,Return x And x Retire.,107,That just leaves Palm.
31801,Return x And x Retire.,107,You haven't been able to reach her?
31802,Return x And x Retire.,107,No.
31803,Return x And x Retire.,107,She's probably still in the palace...
31804,Return x And x Retire.,107,Nen{\i0
31805,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I imagine she's in the warehouse, \Nbeneath the palace."
31806,Return x And x Retire.,107,There are about five kilometers \Nof corridors surrounding it.
31807,Return x And x Retire.,107,En{\i0
31808,Return x And x Retire.,107,"But since the exit is in the \Npalace, she can't get out."
31809,Return x And x Retire.,107,How's Knov-san doing?
31810,Return x And x Retire.,107,Well... he's probably out of this fight.
31811,Return x And x Retire.,107,But he did manage to place the exits.
31812,Return x And x Retire.,107,There's no change to our plan.
31813,Return x And x Retire.,107,Three days to go...
31814,Return x And x Retire.,107,His wounds are already healed!
31815,Return x And x Retire.,107,No problem.
31816,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money."
31817,Return x And x Retire.,107,You can leave. Right now.
31818,Return x And x Retire.,107,What are you doing?
31819,Return x And x Retire.,107,Let's go.
31820,Return x And x Retire.,107,Huh?
31821,Return x And x Retire.,107,We're gonna join my buddies.
31822,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll introduce you.
31823,Return x And x Retire.,107,But...
31824,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Well, I won't force you."
31825,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'll just tell you this.
31826,Return x And x Retire.,107,Thank you.
31827,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Uh, wait..."
31828,Return x And x Retire.,107,Actually...
31829,Return x And x Retire.,107,It's okay if I come?
31830,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I mean, I'm just a..."
31831,Return x And x Retire.,107,What?
31832,Return x And x Retire.,107,Was I the only one who thought \Nwe were already friends?
31833,Return x And x Retire.,107,It's really... okay?
31834,Return x And x Retire.,107,It isn't about what's okay.
31835,Return x And x Retire.,107,It's whether you're coming or not.
31836,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'm going! I'm going with you!
31837,Return x And x Retire.,107,I want to make something clear.
31838,Return x And x Retire.,107,"The next time something like this happens,"
31839,Return x And x Retire.,107,I won't bother thanking you.
31840,Return x And x Retire.,107,"So if something happens, \Nand I end up helping you, you don't need to thank me."
31841,Return x And x Retire.,107,Friends are supposed to help friends.
31842,Return x And x Retire.,107,"From now on, we'll be working together."
31843,Return x And x Retire.,107,So we'll be helping each other.
31844,Return x And x Retire.,107,Supporting each other isn't a big deal.
31845,Return x And x Retire.,107,It'd be lame to thank each other \Nfor every little thing.
31846,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Yeah, this is it."
31847,Return x And x Retire.,107,This is the world I wanted.
31848,Return x And x Retire.,107,The world I longed for and sought...
31849,Return x And x Retire.,107,"But deep down, I thought \Nit was beyond my reach..."
31850,Return x And x Retire.,107,That it wasn't meant for me... \NAnd wouldn't happen...
31851,Return x And x Retire.,107,I'd given up on this world.
31852,Return x And x Retire.,107,I thought it wasn't meant to be...
31853,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Killua, I'm..."
31854,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I'm so happy, I could die!"
31855,Return x And x Retire.,107,Huh? Why are you crying?
31856,Return x And x Retire.,107,Because...
31857,Return x And x Retire.,107,Because you're doing this for me!
31858,Return x And x Retire.,107,Come on...
31859,Return x And x Retire.,107,I want to make one more thing clear.
31860,Return x And x Retire.,107,The world you're stepping into is far more brutal than the world of the Chimera Ants.
31861,Return x And x Retire.,107,"They may seem similar, but there's a huge difference between \Nrisking a life and throwing it away."
31862,Return x And x Retire.,107,People staring death in the face every day don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.
31863,Return x And x Retire.,107,"Only people who maintain a daily \Nregimen to stay in tip-top shape, and can swallow just enough poison to \Nfall short of a lethal dose, get to survive."
31864,Return x And x Retire.,107,That's how it goes.
31865,Return x And x Retire.,107,Are you ready to join us?
31866,Return x And x Retire.,107,How could you know the words I most wanted to hear?
31867,Return x And x Retire.,107,A foolish question.
31868,Return x And x Retire.,107,I see paradise before me.
31869,Return x And x Retire.,107,"I'm going, no matter what it costs me."
31870,Return x And x Retire.,107,I've seen the other side...
31871,Return x And x Retire.,107,I've made contact.
31872,Return x And x Retire.,107,I've learned it really exists...
31873,Return x And x Retire.,107,And I can reach it!
31874,Return x And x Retire.,107,Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.
31875,Return x And x Retire.,107,"2-1-3, marshal."
31876,Return x And x Retire.,107,"4-5-1, knight."
31877,Return x And x Retire.,107,8-7-uh... lieutenant general!
31878,Return x And x Retire.,107,4-3-3... 2?
31879,Return x And x Retire.,107,My phone number!
31880,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Three days remain until the selection begins.
31881,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"In the palace, the King has \Ncompleted his recovery, and continues to play Gungi without rest."
31882,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That's checkmate.
31883,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Her mind and body are at their limit.
31884,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I estimate it will only take another \Nmatch or two before the King wins.
31885,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Gungi x Of x Komugi
31886,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Time for a break.
31887,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,We will resume in a half day.
31888,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Wait, I can keep going!"
31889,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If you can barely sit straight, \Nthe victory won't satisfy me."
31890,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Recover your strength.
31891,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Even while his arm was being treated, \Nthe King never stopped playing."
31892,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But now he changes his mind?
31893,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,This female is dangerous.
31894,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If this continues, she could prove quite troublesome..."
31895,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Then, I will excuse myself."
31896,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I must not be too hasty.
31897,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The King chose to retract his decree.
31898,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,In order to stay true to his convictions...
31899,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,In order to defeat the Gungi \NChampion at her best...
31900,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,In order to demonstrate his strength!
31901,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If I kill this girl now, the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever."
31902,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Her death will cement her status as someone the King could never defeat!
31903,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am such a fool!
31904,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,My hasty impulse could have left \Nthe King with a permanent scar!
31905,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I shall die of my own volition!
31906,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Once I have seen the King conquer the world...
31907,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex, \Nseven people will infiltrate the palace."
31908,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Shoot and me...
31909,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Gon, Killua,"
31910,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Meleoron, Ikalgo, and then Morel."
31911,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"A few seconds after us,"
31912,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,En{\i0
31913,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"During that time, we must draw \Nthe Royal Guard from the King."
31914,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first."
31915,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"When we suddenly appear \Nin the midst of the palace, their immediate reaction will be..."
31916,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,To protect the King with their lives.
31917,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,They'll probably use a formation like this.
31918,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Breaking it won't be easy.
31919,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,And that's where I come in.
31920,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Okay, any questions?"
31921,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Uh, about Palm..."
31922,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Can we do anything to learn \Nwhat's happened to her?
31923,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She's either dead or in hiding.
31924,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us."
31925,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation."
31926,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If she were captured, \Nshe'd have taken her own life."
31927,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"When she left, she was prepared for that."
31928,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If we try to check in on her, \Nit would be an insult to her resolve."
31929,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Hey, you're being too harsh!"
31930,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Gon's just concerned about Palm.
31931,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,And his concern is worthless.
31932,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What's that?!
31933,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You just came back! Where do you get off?!
31934,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Assuming that Palm was captured alive, it would mean the enemy knows our plan."
31935,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Which would make us like moths \Nflying straight into the flame.
31936,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,We'll be destroyed instantly.
31937,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios, what's important is that we trust Palm."
31938,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Well, that certainly makes sense, but Gon's point might be that, if Palm has met such a fate, we still \Nhave time to change the plan."
31939,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Think again.
31940,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,He'll say that we have to save Palm first.
31941,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But he won't offer any plans for that.
31942,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Right?
31943,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,R-Right...
31944,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I see your point...
31945,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"I know you're worried, but once the operation starts, \Nyou'll have to forget her until we're done."
31946,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If you're distracted for a fraction of a second, that might cause our operation to fail."
31947,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,We still have two days...
31948,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,There's still time for Palm to contact us.
31949,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Nyow{\i0
31950,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Should I have tried to escape to the right?
31951,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You should have moved your knight.
31952,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I didn't want to let a single piece \Ncontrol the center of the board.
31953,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Sometimes, you must accept \Nthe risk and move forward."
31954,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Otherwise, you won't ever be \Nable to make me hesitate."
31955,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.
31956,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Your Majesty...
31957,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What is it?
31958,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"I have some sensitive information, \Nso we should step outside."
31959,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"It's fine, speak."
31960,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Two days remain until the National Celebration.
31961,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The number of citizens to process in Peijing \Nhas increased beyond our expectations.
31962,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"But the weather forecast is favorable, \Nso the selection should proceed as planned."
31963,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Get to the point.
31964,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I would like to move up the post-selection schedule.
31965,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That's it? Do as you wish.
31966,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Yes, sir."
31967,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"In that case, we will depart \Nimmediately after the selection—"
31968,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Don't make me repeat myself!
31969,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I'm telling you to decide on your own.
31970,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Do not return until I summon you.
31971,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"So you were chased out, too?"
31972,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Well, we only need to wait for the King to win."
31973,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"You think that will only be a \Nfew more matches, right?"
31974,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,No.
31975,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Wasn't that what you said a while ago?
31976,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The King is improving at a remarkable rate.
31977,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"However, she is also evolving."
31978,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am no longer able to predict the outcome.
31979,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Well, it's still only a matter of \Ntime before the King wins."
31980,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I hope you're right.
31981,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am. There's nothing to worry about.
31982,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am one hundred percent confident \Nthat he's acting on his own...
31983,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The man who defeated Leol.
31984,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.
31985,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The soldiers under his control \Nare all smoke puppets.
31986,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Nen{\i1 they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.
31987,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"He can't control as many puppets as I can, \Nbut his are more responsive."
31988,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I want to fight him...
31989,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But I can't leave my post.
31990,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Maybe he'll come to me...
31991,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,It's about time for us to enter Peijing.
31992,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The enemy should have noticed \NMorel's distraction by now.
31993,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate their belief that this is all the work of one man.
31994,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"At the same time, many citizens will be moving toward the palace."
31995,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If we disappear the day before the celebration, they'll believe assassins are hidden \Namong the citizens, trying to kill the King."
31996,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"And their focus will be outside \Nthe palace, on the crowds."
31997,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That's when we enter the palace with \NFour-Dimensional Apartment Complex!
31998,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The King will definitely be here.
31999,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Watching the selection from \Nthe third-floor throne room.
32000,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Will he really be there?
32001,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Something... feels off.
32002,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"2-1-3, pawn."
32003,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"4-5-1, knight."
32004,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"8-7-2, lieutenant general."
32005,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"4-3-3, archer."
32006,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She continues to attack where \NI'm weak without hesitation.
32007,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"As we play, she's getting sharper."
32008,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"2-1-1, knight."
32009,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"6-6-1, major general."
32010,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But it does not pain me.
32011,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Rather, I find this enjoyable."
32012,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Because the board dictates my every move.
32013,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Which proves that she is still \Nseveral levels above me.
32014,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,How strong can she become?
32015,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Supreme Leader...
32016,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I feel... strange.
32017,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I can't stop.
32018,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...
32019,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I can become even better!
32020,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Has she awakened?
32021,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Then she's only begun to grow.
32022,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That's checkmate.
32023,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Could I take a short break?
32024,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,It's the first time she's asked for a break...
32025,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Is something wrong?
32026,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"No, I'd like to return to my room to \Nrecord the moves that are in my mind."
32027,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But you can't see...
32028,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!"
32029,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"When I touch the pieces after they're placed,"
32030,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I will never forget their position.
32031,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She's memorized every placement \Nshe's ever experienced?
32032,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Very well, you're excused."
32033,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Thank you.
32034,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,A foolish question...
32035,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Her name...
32036,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Hey.
32037,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What is your name?
32038,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You mean mine?
32039,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Is there anyone else around?
32040,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,It's K-K-Komugi.
32041,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Komugi?
32042,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Supreme Leader...
32043,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Can you please tell me what your name is?
32044,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,My name?
32045,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What... am I called?
32046,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Pitou.
32047,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Yes, what do you need?"
32048,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Pouf.
32049,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yes.
32050,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Youpi.
32051,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yes.
32052,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Is something the matter?
32053,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Pouf...
32054,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yes?
32055,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Right, you're Pouf."
32056,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Then...
32057,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What is my name?
32058,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty..."
32059,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You are the King. You have no other name.
32060,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You are the one and only King.
32061,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"At the moment, there are impostors \Nusing that name without permission, but we will eliminate them all."
32062,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,So that the entire world will \Nknow there is only one King.
32063,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That assumes the others can be eliminated.
32064,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"""King"" is a title."
32065,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name."
32066,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"What of you, Youpi?"
32067,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Your question is far beyond my capacity.
32068,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.
32069,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Pitou.
32070,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I believe that your feelings \Nare what matter most.
32071,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You should select the name \Nthat you find most pleasing.
32072,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Very well, then."
32073,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You can choose a name after the selection.
32074,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Right now, our priority is to finish all the \Npreparations before tomorrow morning."
32075,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Your Majesty, is something wrong?"
32076,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If you have any concerns, we shall address them."
32077,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That is why we are here.
32078,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Komugi's entire body was glowing.
32079,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Komugi?
32080,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The girl with the closed eyes.
32081,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,He's remembered that human's name.
32082,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She experienced an awakening.
32083,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Komugi will now become much stronger, \Nalthough only at Gungi."
32084,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Pitou...
32085,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yes.
32086,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If Komugi were put through the selection that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?"
32087,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She would die.
32088,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The selection chooses humans with the physical and mental \Nstrength to serve as soldiers.
32089,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The survivors will be those who demonstrate \Nexcellent combat capabilities.
32090,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Your Majesty, please..."
32091,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"After meeting Komugi,"
32092,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I've learned that strength can \Nmanifest in different ways.
32093,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"For example, during our trip here..."
32094,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Your Majesty, please stop."
32095,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,...I killed a child.
32096,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Your Majesty, you must not say it..."
32097,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Perhaps that child...
32098,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,It isn't right... It's inappropriate!
32099,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,...had the potential to surpass \Nme in a certain field.
32100,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,An almighty King...
32101,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yet I extinguished that potential.
32102,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,...can never show regret!
32103,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I extinguished it for no real reason.
32104,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You must not say any more!
32105,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am...
32106,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,King!
32107,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I took a life for no reason at all...
32108,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What tremendous strength I must possess!
32109,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"I appear with no warning, to rob \Ncountless beings of their inferior strength!"
32110,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,To crush... To destroy.
32111,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,That is my power.
32112,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Brute force is the strongest \Npower in this world!
32113,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...
32114,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Why not?
32115,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"I jumped to the wrong conclusion, and I nearly insulted the King."
32116,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I was foolish enough to think that the King \Nmight have regretted his actions...
32117,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You always think too much.
32118,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Yes, that is correct."
32119,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived."
32120,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Yes, that is true."
32121,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If the girl will impede the King, \Nwe should kill her."
32122,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,To think my mind operates \Non the same level as yours...
32123,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Yes...
32124,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,My power is the strongest that exists.
32125,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,All other power means nothing\N in the face of my own.
32126,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,They are as dust in the wind.
32127,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Komugi... That female is no different.
32128,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game."
32129,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I could turn her into no more than \Na source of meat with the barest touch.
32130,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,So her life depends on my mood.
32131,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"If I change my mind,"
32132,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I can immediately kill her!
32133,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Then why am I so hesitant?
32134,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The goal was to kill time while \Nwaiting for the selection.
32135,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,The selection is tomorrow... \NHaven't I had enough?
32136,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I've had my fun. I no longer need her.
32137,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Do I kill her now?!
32138,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Th-Thank you very much...
32139,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Why did you not call for help?
32140,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Here...
32141,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,And here...
32142,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You're covered in blood!
32143,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Damn, I don't believe it."
32144,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,She's such a fragile creature!
32145,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Because it's still early...
32146,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I don't want to bother anyone else.
32147,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You aren't bothering anyone.
32148,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What am...
32149,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,You are an important guest!
32150,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,...I saying?
32151,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Didn't I come here to kill her?
32152,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Why do you cry?!
32153,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Why can't I do it?
32154,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,I'm sorry!
32155,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,But... But...
32156,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,No one's ever been this nice to me!
32157,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What is this creature?
32158,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,What do I want to do with her?
32159,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.
32160,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,"Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas \Nkeep flooding into my mind—"
32161,Gungi x Of x Komugi.,108,Then we're covered for future preview segments!
32162,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Th-Thank you very much...
32163,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Why did you not call for help?
32164,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Here...
32165,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,And here...
32166,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,You're covered in blood!
32167,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What is this creature?
32168,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What do I want to do with her?
32169,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action
32170,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,One day remains before the selection.
32171,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning."
32172,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Good morning.
32173,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,You boys are up early.
32174,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We have nineteen hours until \Nmidnight strikes on selection day.
32175,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Tonight, we finally make our move."
32176,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Let's do one final check.
32177,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once inside, Gon and I immediately head up the central stairway, \Ntoward the throne room."
32178,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Yep.
32179,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Ikalgo will take the northeast elevator down to the \Nbasement, to search for Palm."
32180,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If you find her, escape without us."
32181,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Right.
32182,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If the King and his three Royal Guards \Nare in the throne room, we proceed with the plan."
32183,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"The problem is, what if they're not there?"
32184,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,You're really hung up on that...
32185,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What are the chances of that happening?
32186,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Well, it's highly unlikely."
32187,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But the unusual happens pretty often.
32188,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Aren't you contradicting yourself?
32189,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We researched the enemy's behavior extensively \Nbefore deciding on a day for the attack.
32190,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"When you're waiting for someone to be \Nin a certain place, at a certain time, that's typically when the unexpected happens."
32191,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In my old job, I saw this all the time."
32192,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The unusual always happens \Non the day you've chosen.
32193,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In my old job, I could wait for the next chance, to ensure my success."
32194,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"But this time, that isn't an option."
32195,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We can't wait.
32196,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once we move, there's no turning back."
32197,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,A moment's hesitation can mean death!
32198,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,So we should take time now to decide how we'll act in different situations.
32199,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Even if they aren't in the throne room, \Nif they're still in the palace, it's okay."
32200,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32201,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter, we'll know that they're there."
32202,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"From there, we just follow that \Nsinister aura to where it feels densest, and they'll be at its center."
32203,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The question is what we do if \Nwe don't sense Pitou's aura.
32204,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In other words, what we do \Nif they aren't in the palace."
32205,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32206,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Would they be in the palace,"
32207,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32208,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That's what happened when \NKnov-san infiltrated the palace!
32209,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Huh?
32210,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Yes, that's what I can't make sense of."
32211,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura."
32212,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.
32213,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"So if Pouf was there, the other two were \Nalso in the palace with the King."
32214,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"En{\i0 leaving Pouf to handle security, which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?"
32215,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I believe the reason has to do with \Nhow Pitou's power works...
32216,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Then we should ask Colt.
32217,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Yeah.
32218,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I'd guess that during that time, \NPitou was healing someone."
32219,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Healing?
32220,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I told you that Pitou was the \None who restored Kite, yes?"
32221,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32222,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Thus, healing must require a \Ngreat deal of concentration."
32223,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"So while healing someone,"
32224,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32225,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Now it makes sense.
32226,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Which means that someone, most likely the King or one of the \NRoyal Guard, was injured and"
32227,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32228,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But hold on...
32229,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Who would have been able to \Ninjure one of those monsters?
32230,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,True...
32231,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,An internal dispute?
32232,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?
32233,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"No, that's impossible."
32234,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,There is no chance that Pitou \Nwould endanger the King
32235,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32236,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I guarantee it.
32237,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Which means that the one injured...
32238,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,...was the King!
32239,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I see... What you're saying makes sense.
32240,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But then the bigger question \Nis who injured the King.
32241,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.
32242,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But other soldiers could never put \Nso much as a scratch on him.
32243,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Yep, so our conclusion was..."
32244,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The King injured himself?!
32245,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Under what circumstances \Nwould that have happened?
32246,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"We don't know why, but it's the only explanation."
32247,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'll admit that I didn't question our \Nsudden stroke of luck too much...
32248,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But that chance was only possible \Nunder abnormal circumstances.
32249,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Are they starting to lose control?
32250,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That isn't good...
32251,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'm starting to think something's \Ngoing on inside the palace.
32252,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We will now begin moving to the palace.
32253,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in \NDiego Plaza at once."
32254,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The citizens of the other sectors \Nshould prepare to move out.
32255,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Oh, they're starting to file out."
32256,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They've begun their march...
32257,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts."
32258,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three, five million humans will fill the palace grounds."
32259,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Has the situation in Peijing changed?
32260,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I thought it was only one skilled enemy, \Nbut now there are a bunch."
32261,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,So there are reinforcements.
32262,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They may try to use the celebration \Nas cover to approach us.
32263,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Then the danger will be greatest \Nduring the selection.
32264,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Yes, since the King will be \Nparticipating in the selection."
32265,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Our greatest concern is the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.
32266,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Nen{\i0 and that that person can use the ability \Nto isolate the King somewhere else...
32267,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That means at least one of us must stay by the King's side during the selection.
32268,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The King won't allow it.
32269,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"As it is, he's been upset by how \Nclose we've stayed to him."
32270,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Then we guard him secretly, \Nwithout his knowledge."
32271,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We need someone to stay just close \Nenough to monitor his surroundings while still carrying out his own role in the selection...
32272,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Whose size won't attract attention, who won't get absorbed in an amusing task..."
32273,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Very well, I am the best choice for this."
32274,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Strictly by process of elimination, of course..."
32275,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What's wrong?
32276,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Their presences have completely disappeared.
32277,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I can't sense any residual aura.
32278,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Zetsu{\i0
32279,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Hey.
32280,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,There are so many people...
32281,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Around a hundred per building.
32282,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They must have been packed inside.
32283,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Then if we conceal our presences, they can only assume that we're \Nhiding among the citizens."
32284,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Maybe they'll cancel the march?
32285,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,No way.
32286,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That would mean delaying or \Neven canceling the celebration.
32287,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Which would imply the King had \Naccepted defeat and compromised.
32288,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The Royal Guard won't let that happen.
32289,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"The celebration will begin as scheduled, \Nno matter the cost."
32290,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!"
32291,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,And that won't change.
32292,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once the humans began to move, my puppets could no longer tell them apart..."
32293,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Should I recall them?
32294,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"No, giving the enemy free \Nrein would be dangerous."
32295,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Have the puppets join the soldiers that \Nare guiding the citizens, as a deterrent."
32296,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,'Sup?
32297,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"As expected, the puppets have joined the march."
32298,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In another hour, those sectors will be deserted."
32299,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,There are six entrances to the \Nrooms that lead to the palace.
32300,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"We'll avoid the entrances in front of the \Npalace, where security will be tighter, and wait by entrances A, B, \Nand C, behind the palace."
32301,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once we've entered the rooms, the only exit will lead inside the palace."
32302,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What? You scared?
32303,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Don't be absurd.
32304,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I merely want to be sure we're prepared.
32305,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Waiting by the entrances involves \Nquite a lot of risk.
32306,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"But if we enter the rooms too early, \Nwe won't be able to exit until midnight."
32307,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,True...
32308,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If we receive any useful information, we want to be free to act on it..."
32309,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"And we can't use cell phones near the palace, since the Ants will pick up on the signal."
32310,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I think it's dangerous to spend hours \Nwaiting inside the rooms, not knowing if there have been \Naccidents or changes in the situation."
32311,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But you're the one who said it was \Nrisky to wait outside the palace.
32312,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Yes...
32313,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,You shouldn't take their security net lightly.
32314,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'll take care of it.
32315,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'm the only one who can freely \Nenter and exit these rooms.
32316,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If anything happens, I'll tell you."
32317,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"For now, you should rest here."
32318,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Will you be okay?
32319,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I shouldn't have any problem \Ninvestigating the area...
32320,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32321,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But you should be careful.
32322,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32323,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"It changes shape like an amoeba, \Ngiving it extended range."
32324,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That's what Kite came in contact with.
32325,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,And it was probably deliberate...
32326,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,It's a fighter's instinct to want to know \Nhow strong the opponent is.
32327,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.
32328,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32329,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Make sure you stay out of range.
32330,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Don't worry about it.
32331,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"In this room, I'm the one who most fears them."
32332,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I won't do anything crazy.
32333,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I promise you that.
32334,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We will now head to the palace.
32335,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Any person who leaves their line \Nwill be shot on the spot.
32336,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Move out!
32337,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Pitou...
32338,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,You knew that Komugi was being attacked?
32339,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,En{\i0
32340,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"However,"
32341,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I determined that there was no threat \Nto Your Majesty, so I ignored it."
32342,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings, and deal with any threats at once."
32343,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Yes, as you command."
32344,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Tens of thousands of people are marching in a line toward the King.
32345,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Like ants... No, lemmings."
32346,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,A march of death.
32347,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,It will be dark soon.
32348,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I can tell Morel and the \Nothers to come out...
32349,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,What is that?
32350,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Wing scales?
32351,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The wind is carrying the scales of \Nhis wings toward the citizens...
32352,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That means...
32353,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,As I thought...
32354,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They all look completely vacant and dazed.
32355,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Those scales have a hypnotic effect.
32356,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Stay in line as you advance!
32357,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Stay in line!
32358,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once you reach your position, wait for orders."
32359,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Do not move!
32360,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Simple orders delivered repeatedly, \Nwhile tanks roll in the background can easily seep into a mind exhausted \Nfrom hours of marching..."
32361,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!
32362,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Once the selection begins, \Nand blood starts to fly, they will continue to quietly stand in place."
32363,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Until it's their turn.
32364,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Hypnosis? I see...
32365,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run."
32366,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But this works out for us.
32367,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Eh?
32368,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If we make a lot of noise, we won't have to worry about citizens panicking."
32369,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Ah!
32370,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,There won't be any stampede of humans \Nfalling over each other to escape.
32371,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That's a big boon.
32372,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Assuming that over half of the people \Nwill be in place at midnight, we would have expected a stampede to \Nleave tens of thousands of casualties."
32373,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Our biggest concern has been addressed.
32374,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We can go crazy.
32375,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Six hours to go.
32376,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Everyone's here.
32377,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Have you heard from Palm?
32378,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,No.
32379,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Oh...
32380,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,We'll keep waiting until half \Nan hour before go time.
32381,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If we knew what's inside before \Ngoing in, it'd be very different..."
32382,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Yeah.
32383,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They both look composed.
32384,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Killua, in particular, shows none of the mental weakness he \Ndisplayed when we fought."
32385,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.
32386,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"But for some reason, he seems on the verge of fading away."
32387,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"No, I don't have time to worry about others."
32388,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.
32389,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,The fate of humanity rests on me...
32390,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Colt is a good guy...
32391,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.
32392,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants. \NEveryone has a heart.
32393,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,That's what I want to believe.
32394,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Hopefully, the King also has one."
32395,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But some of them must be killed...
32396,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!"
32397,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Kite, it's almost time."
32398,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I promise to turn you back...
32399,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,By defeating that Ant.
32400,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,He's fired up...
32401,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'll focus on providing support.
32402,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,So no one can interfere in your battle...
32403,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Using my new Kanmuru technique.
32404,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,My body feels heavy.
32405,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'm suffering from days without rest...
32406,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"On a scale of 1 to 100, my current \Ncondition would be 40..."
32407,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"No, 35..."
32408,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But I can't be whining now.
32409,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"With Knov out, I'm the only one left."
32410,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I was hoping to fight at full strength, but it's easier to accept my fate this way."
32411,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'll focus on playing the decoy and \Ndrawing my target from the King.
32412,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"I'm sorry, Morel and everyone..."
32413,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But I can't bring myself to go.
32414,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I'll take a look outside.
32415,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,So two minutes is the longest \NI can hold my breath...
32416,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit \Nwill probably be, at most, half that."
32417,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Good enough...
32418,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,One minute is more than enough time!
32419,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn."
32420,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"A few days ago, I couldn't have \Ndreamed of such a life."
32421,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"Thank you, Killua."
32422,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I promise to carry out my mission for you!
32423,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Tomorrow will be my birthday!
32424,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I am the King.
32425,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,But who am I?
32426,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Why was I brought into this world?
32427,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Time's up... Let's go!
32428,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Palm...
32429,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Ten minutes remain until \Nthey enter the palace.
32430,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.
32431,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,"It's so cold, Gon..."
32432,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,They said Admiral Winter is coming!
32433,Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.,109,I think you mean General Winter.
32434,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Facing the palace, each of the three exits is progressively closer to the throne room."
32435,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Okay, we're all agreed."
32436,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"We'll all use the closest exit, \Nand bust in from beside the central stairway."
32437,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Confusion x And x Expectation
32438,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"This seemed like a good idea \Nsince Leol-sama praised me so much,"
32439,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Nen{\i0
32440,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Nen{\i0
32441,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,This was a bad idea.
32442,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"To a girl, there's nothing \Nworse than losing your figure."
32443,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!
32444,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Right, Shidore?"
32445,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Having a peon that understands \Nspeech is useful, but..."
32446,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You really need to talk more.
32447,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You have permission to shoot her on sight!
32448,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"As a foreigner, she can't blend \Nin with the other citizens!"
32449,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Damn! Damn that woman!
32450,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What does she want?
32451,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Hey!
32452,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,How many times have I told you \Nnot to use your cell phone here?
32453,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The radio waves irritate my ears, \Nand it gives me a headache!"
32454,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Plus, I can hear what you're saying."
32455,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Next time I catch you, I'll snap your \Nphone and your arm in half."
32456,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,W-Well... There are urgent matters \Nthat must be dealt with.
32457,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I need to use my phone.
32458,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,It's so urgent that you find \Nthe woman who ran away?
32459,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I can find her for you.
32460,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,R-Really?
32461,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,My nose happens to be very sharp...
32462,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If you have something she wore, I can track her."
32463,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do, and I respect you, as well!"
32464,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here."
32465,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,O-Okay!
32466,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Hold on, and I'll bring you something."
32467,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I will become the King behind the scenes.
32468,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"To accomplish that, I must be friendly \Nwith Bizeff, not with the King."
32469,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued."
32470,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Bah.
32471,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"When peons send transmissions, \Nit gives me a headache."
32472,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,This smells like...
32473,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Taragette's blood.
32474,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.
32475,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,An intruder!
32476,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If he took his shoes off here \Nto avoid leaving footprints, he must be somewhere deeper within."
32477,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,He didn't hide his shoes because he had a pressing mission and \Ncouldn't afford to lose time...
32478,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"That day last week, when it rained?"
32479,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That was the day Taragette went missing.
32480,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.
32481,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But that means he disposed of Taragette's body while leaving his shoes behind.
32482,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There's no blood trail nearby.
32483,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If he wrapped the body in something to move it, he must have come prepared."
32484,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?
32485,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Why would they do that?!
32486,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Damn, I don't get this!"
32487,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?
32488,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, I'll catch the intruder, \Nand get the answers from him."
32489,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,He did head inside the palace!
32490,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...
32491,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Follow me!
32492,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What is your name?
32493,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,It's K-K-Komugi.
32494,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Can you please tell me what your name is?
32495,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I didn't get to learn his name...
32496,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I can't wait to play him again!
32497,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Who am I?
32498,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.
32499,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,My subjects are mindless puppets.
32500,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,If this is the fate that the \Nheavens have granted me...
32501,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I have no doubt that I shall \Nbe slowly bored to death!
32502,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Don't follow me.
32503,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yes, but—"
32504,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Do not make me repeat myself.
32505,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Now we've all been beaten by the King.
32506,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32507,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I figured he would be saying that soon.
32508,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But I can't remove our security...
32509,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Then you go and tell him that!
32510,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I don't want another beating.
32511,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,How does this sound?
32512,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We can block all aura in a radius \Nsurrounding Your Majesty.
32513,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"This way, my presence will not bother you."
32514,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Are you telling me to stay in one place?
32515,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Given that keeping the aura-free zone around me \Nwhile I move wouldn't be possible.
32516,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I refuse to have my movement \Nconstantly monitored.
32517,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, that would not be our proposal."
32518,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"So if I do not wish to deal with your presence, \NI will only be able to move within that confined area."
32519,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I must order you to move that zone \Nshould I wish to go elsewhere?
32520,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There is nothing more I can say.
32521,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32522,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.
32523,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Are you dissatisfied?
32524,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Should that not suffice to guard \Nagainst outside attacks?
32525,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Or are you saying that there \Nare already enemies inside?
32526,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32527,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You're absolutely correct.
32528,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0 any attack from underground.
32529,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"In addition,"
32530,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32531,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Do you mean Komugi?
32532,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace, and they are free to enter and leave at will."
32533,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"A check is performed each time someone enters, but if the soldier were being \Ncontrolled by the enemy, it would be difficult to know for sure."
32534,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That means—
32535,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Enough.
32536,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32537,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That will permit you to guard \Nagainst any underground attack!
32538,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Tell everyone that no one is allowed \Non the second floor or above.
32539,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Should an intruder come, I shall \Ndeal with them personally."
32540,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!"
32541,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If you disturb me, it will \Nhave violent consequences!"
32542,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The other Ants were never allowed on or above the second floor...
32543,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But where do I go now?
32544,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The central stairway connecting the \Nfirst and second floors, I suppose..."
32545,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If an intruder comes from underground, you will be in position to deal with them."
32546,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately."
32547,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Is he upset about losing \Nall those Gungi matches?
32548,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.
32549,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"My ability, Spiritual Message, would be \Nable to confirm my suspicions."
32550,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"However, that would be an insult to the King!"
32551,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, I'm just making excuses..."
32552,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The truth is that I'm afraid.
32553,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"So afraid of what it is that grows inside the King even as we speak,"
32554,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I cannot bear it...
32555,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Tsk, the rain washed away the scent."
32556,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But now I have the answer.
32557,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The intruder hid here to \Ncheck the second floor, but instead of going upstairs, he exited."
32558,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Something made him give up his mission?
32559,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Or did he accomplish his objective?
32560,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, he may have used his power!"
32561,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I should probably warn you...
32562,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If any of you go to the second \Nfloor, the King will kill you."
32563,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Tell everyone else in the palace.
32564,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yes, sir."
32565,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Wings!
32566,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What if the intruder has the power to fly?
32567,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The shoes and scent could have \Nbeen there to mislead us.
32568,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,He could have flown up to the second floor!
32569,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Youpi-dono...
32570,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Huh?
32571,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Uh, er..."
32572,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Pitou is monitoring the palace with {\i0
32573,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If they'd gone to the second floor, \Nthey would have been caught..."
32574,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Ah, sorry... It's not important."
32575,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Huh?
32576,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That doesn't make sense!
32577,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!
32578,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Youpi-dono...
32579,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Huh? What is it?
32580,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32581,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"For example, that day last week when it rained?"
32582,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What? You didn't hear what happened?
32583,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There was a huge uproar...
32584,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The King tore off his own arm!
32585,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32586,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32587,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I wouldn't know about that...
32588,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?
32589,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i1
32590,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The intruder saw that aura, and gave up on ascending!"
32591,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That all makes sense.
32592,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"The question is what the \Nintruder's objective was, and whether he's still hiding around here."
32593,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Do I tell Youpi?
32594,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No, I can't do that..."
32595,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.
32596,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Pouf would be the best choice.
32597,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"And if possible, I need to determine what the intruder's objective was."
32598,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Otherwise, my report would be that the intruder somehow \Nmade it inside the palace,"
32599,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110, En{\i1
32600,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I won't get any credit.
32601,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"I can make up an objective, but if the intruder is captured, \Nthey'll find out I lied."
32602,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions \Nand the intruder is never found, it would only waste their time \Nand damage my own standing."
32603,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!
32604,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I have a great idea...
32605,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,So the intruder captured one of my men.
32606,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"According to Leol, that intruder \Nhas the ability to teleport."
32607,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I believe that he and the \Nwoman are working together.
32608,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,They probably teleported out together.
32609,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Damn, but why would they do that?"
32610,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yes, that's the question."
32611,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"However, I've discerned their objective."
32612,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What is it?
32613,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,To blow up the palace.
32614,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That's a lie.
32615,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What?
32616,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We must tell the Royal Guard!
32617,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Wait.
32618,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Don't be in such a rush.
32619,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We can tell them after we've found the bomb.
32620,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There's no time!
32621,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Calm down, and consider this \Nfrom their perspective..."
32622,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Eh?
32623,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If they want to blow up the palace, \Nthey'll wait until they're sure the King is here."
32624,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,When would that be?
32625,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,When all the citizens have assembled...
32626,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Right before the ceremony begins!
32627,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There will be five million humans!
32628,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,What a sight that will be to see...
32629,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Just imagine looking down on them!
32630,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The King would not allow a double \Nto steal that gratification from him!
32631,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,So he will be there in person!
32632,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,It's only logical to assume the enemy \Nreached the same conclusion.
32633,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,True...
32634,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's \Nside for many of these celebrations...
32635,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The experience brings indescribable \Npleasure beyond even sexual gratification.
32636,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We still have over half a day \Nbefore the ceremony.
32637,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If I use my nose to track the intruder, we can find the bomb with time to spare."
32638,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If we have proof when we report to the \NRoyal Guard, we'll look much better."
32639,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful."
32640,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Right?
32641,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Yes... That's true.
32642,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you."
32643,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Okay, that sounds good."
32644,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The coward finally calmed down?
32645,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'm getting closer to becoming \Nthe King behind the scenes!
32646,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Seven minutes to go.
32647,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.
32648,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Assemble near the exit then.
32649,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Until then, stand by."
32650,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Meleoron, about your power..."
32651,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I know.
32652,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds \Nbefore I need to breathe...
32653,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"And then, I'll tap you again when \NI start to hold my breath again!"
32654,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You don't need to push your limits.
32655,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You should catch your breath \Nwhenever you need to.
32656,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"When God's Accomplice isn't active, \Nyou can trust me to handle things."
32657,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Why don't you have a smoke?
32658,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If you underestimate their sense \Nof smell, you'll die quickly..."
32659,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Tracking someone by the smell of \Ncigarette smoke is simple for them.
32660,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We could be knocked out the \Nsecond I take my first breath...
32661,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The boss will be putting up a smokescreen \Nwhen we go in. It'll be fine.
32662,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk."
32663,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I don't want to regret my decision.
32664,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The Royal Guard is on the move.
32665,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The three of them gathered above the \Nfront gate to discuss something.
32666,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside."
32667,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales, so I don't think anything has changed."
32668,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'll let you know if anything else happens.
32669,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yeah, until we leave, feed us as \Nmuch information as you can."
32670,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Essentially, that eliminates the \Npossibility of the Royal Guard being out of the palace."
32671,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Essentially, but not completely..."
32672,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King."
32673,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You can't guarantee anything.
32674,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"We have to be prepared for any possibility, or we'll be slow to react when \Nsomething goes wrong!"
32675,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You only say that because you don't \Nunderstand how loyal they are.
32676,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,It's impossible that they'd leave the King!
32677,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The Royal Guard is always with the King!
32678,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,And it's fine to believe that!
32679,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But we should prepare for any exceptions!
32680,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Give me an example of one \Nof these exceptions!
32681,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There are all kinds of exceptions!
32682,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Honestly, how can they be having \Na dispute at the last second?"
32683,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You're being too unrealistic!
32684,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,One exception could be a woman...
32685,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?
32686,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"I wasn't sure what the King was doing in \Nthe palace, but he was reproducing."
32687,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That must be it.
32688,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I see...
32689,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That would give the King a reason to keep \Nthe Royal Guard from his bedroom...
32690,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Perhaps Bizeff was bringing \Nwomen in for the King.
32691,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Palm and the King?!
32692,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We're sticking to the plan...
32693,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,No matter what's happening to Palm!
32694,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Gon has no idea what they're talking about.
32695,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I'm glad we realized this before we set out.
32696,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If we'd seen something like \Nthat without warning, we'd have frozen in our tracks."
32697,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Get it now?
32698,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You can never overthink something.
32699,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,There are probably other unexpected \Nsituations that we haven't considered yet.
32700,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yes, something is still bothering me."
32701,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Gon...
32702,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Do you understand?
32703,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Let Palm take care of herself!
32704,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"No matter what you see, \Nyou must stay focused on Pitou."
32705,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Yeah!
32706,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"It bothers me, but whether \Na woman's involved or not,"
32707,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I believe we should be prepared \Nfor a third party in the palace.
32708,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I have a feeling that the third party is causing my anxiety.
32709,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Why did the King injure himself?
32710,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Hold on...
32711,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That was just a theory of yours.
32712,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yeah, but you agreed that there \Nwas no other logical explanation."
32713,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You're contradicting yourself...
32714,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?
32715,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Following that logic,"
32716,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,En{\i0
32717,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I understand that...
32718,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But something doesn't feel right.
32719,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"With three minutes left to go, is this \Nsomething worth thinking about?"
32720,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Yeah.
32721,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yeah, think about it..."
32722,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,When would you try to hurt yourself?
32723,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,When I couldn't forgive myself...
32724,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,When you couldn't forgive yourself?
32725,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,That's the logical conclusion...
32726,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"But that would mean the King \Nis a ruler with personal pride, and not just a cold tyrant."
32727,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,True.
32728,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain."
32729,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Speaking from experience, people like him will never \Nbe willing to compromise."
32730,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"If the leader refuses to compromise, \Nneither will the Royal Guard."
32731,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,You should assume that combat \Nwill be our only option!
32732,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Morel was able to sum everything up...
32733,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,But he's wrong.
32734,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The King's self-injury...
32735,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,The third party...
32736,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,We still haven't correctly \Ndeduced what happened.
32737,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I have a feeling... that the truth has the potential \Nto completely ruin our plans!
32738,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,It's time!
32739,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,One minute to go.
32740,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Gather around.
32741,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Damn! We're out of time...
32742,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown."
32743,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Let's do this, boys."
32744,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Get ready to rumble!
32745,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Next time: Charge x And x Invade.
32746,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,"Yeah, hot pots are great in winter..."
32747,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Which reminds me of mystery pots.
32748,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,Charge into the pot!
32749,Confusion x And x Expectation.,110,I think you mean toss into the pot...
32750,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The King's self-injury...
32751,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The third party...
32752,Charge x And x Invade.,111,We still haven't correctly \Ndeduced what happened.
32753,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I have a feeling...
32754,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"At worst, the answer we find could \Npotentially ruin all of our plans."
32755,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It's time!
32756,Charge x And x Invade.,111,One minute to go.
32757,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Gather around.
32758,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Damn! We're out of time...
32759,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Charge x And x Invade
32760,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Two minutes before Morel \Nissued the call to attack...
32761,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over the Republic of East Gorteau.
32762,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Pitou was the first one to notice.
32763,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"The only reason Pitou decided to look up was ""just because."""
32764,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Pitou's hunch was just that faint.
32765,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Something is coming.
32766,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"However, a few seconds later, \Nthat hunch turned to certainty."
32767,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The enemy.
32768,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"But at that point, the enemy was still very high up."
32769,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Too high for even Pitou's \Nexceptional senses to ascertain.
32770,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Pitou's decision to prepare for battle was based solely on primal instinct.
32771,Charge x And x Invade.,111,En{\i0 has vanished.
32772,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Two of the Royal Guard almost \Nsimultaneously spotted the approaching form.
32773,Charge x And x Invade.,111,A dragon!
32774,Charge x And x Invade.,111,At the Same Time
32775,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Ten seconds to go.
32776,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Nine!
32777,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Eight!
32778,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Seven.
32779,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"As Morel counted down to the attack,"
32780,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him."
32781,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Six...
32782,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Five.
32783,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Four.
32784,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Three.
32785,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Two.
32786,Charge x And x Invade.,111,En{\i0 in order to prepare for the coming fight.
32787,Charge x And x Invade.,111,However...
32788,Charge x And x Invade.,111,One.
32789,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Go!
32790,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Your Majesty!
32791,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Dragon Meteor Shower\NDragon Dive
32792,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Dragon Dive.
32793,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The sighting of the enemy
32794,Charge x And x Invade.,111,En{\i0
32795,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Where are they?
32796,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Faced with a serious threat to the King,"
32797,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits, immediately focused on the intruders."
32798,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The countless dragons that rained \Ndown were less significant threats than the humans in the sky.
32799,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Terpsichora!
32800,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Puppet Master's Serenity \NTerpsichora
32801,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Nen{\i0
32802,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It takes less than a tenth of a second \Nafter activation to launch the attack.
32803,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"However, during that fraction of a second, \NPitou could hear Netero speaking."
32804,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I prepared for a variety of responses.
32805,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"But you've made a bad move, little Ant."
32806,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Bad Move
32807,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It really happens.
32808,Charge x And x Invade.,111,You don't think it's possible.
32809,Charge x And x Invade.,111,But it is.
32810,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.
32811,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"When you know you're about to die, you feel \Nas though time slows, and you review your life."
32812,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It's just like that.
32813,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"In fact, I'd consider this \Nphenomenon even more credible."
32814,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Because you can hear what \Nthe other person is thinking.
32815,Charge x And x Invade.,111,You can even obtain information \Nknown only to the other person.
32816,Charge x And x Invade.,111,There is proof that it worked.
32817,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Martial artists call this ""listening with the spirit."""
32818,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Listening with the Spirit
32819,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It's a time perception paradox that occurs \Ncommonly when two skilled warriors clash.
32820,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The secret behind the old man's strength?
32821,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I can think of a few possibilities.
32822,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"First, his{\i0"
32823,Charge x And x Invade.,111,No one can predict his next \Nattack by reading his aura.
32824,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He's lived a long time for a reason.
32825,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He has a plant's mental toughness.
32826,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Hell, he was an old man when \NI was still breast feeding."
32827,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.
32828,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I'd consider him an acquaintance.
32829,Charge x And x Invade.,111,We are like yin and yang.
32830,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Fool, we aren't evenly matched."
32831,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He always has the upper hand.
32832,Charge x And x Invade.,111,What?
32833,Charge x And x Invade.,111,The secret behind his strength?
32834,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I guess there's also that...
32835,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"When it comes to battle, he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva."
32836,Charge x And x Invade.,111,That is his most dangerous ability.
32837,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Netero's sequential movements appeared \Nexceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.
32838,Charge x And x Invade.,111,No
32839,Charge x And x Invade.,111,No...
32840,Charge x And x Invade.,111,There was no doubt that \NNetero's motions had ended
32841,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Nen{\i0
32842,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Essentially, this required the \Nconstriction of time perception, almost to the point of stopping \Ntime entirely for Pitou alone, in order to perceive Netero's actions."
32843,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"In other words, the result was... an attack that could not be dodged."
32844,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Netero, forty-six years old, \Nin the dead of winter."
32845,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Sensing that he had reached his limits \Nof both body and technique, he spent much time in contemplation before he reached an answer."
32846,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Gratitude
32847,Charge x And x Invade.,111,That answer was gratitude.
32848,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Amen...
32849,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He owed a debt to the martial arts \Nthat had helped him to mature.
32850,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"The method he came up with to \Nrepay that debt as best he could... was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day."
32851,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"He would calm himself, worship, pray, ready himself, then punch."
32852,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"At first, completing the sequence \Ntook five or six seconds."
32853,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"On the first day, he required over 18 \Nhours to complete 10,000 punches."
32854,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot."
32855,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"When he awoke, he resumed \Npunching, day after day."
32856,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"After two years, he noticed a difference."
32857,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"After he'd completed 10,000 punches, \Nthe sun was still up."
32858,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis."
32859,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"He managed to complete 10,000 \Npunches of gratitude in under an hour."
32860,Charge x And x Invade.,111,This left him more time for prayer.
32861,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"When Netero came down from \Nthe mountains, his fists were faster than sound."
32862,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Was that my imagination?
32863,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"For a moment, he seemed to disappear..."
32864,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I didn't hear anything until after...
32865,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Master?
32866,Charge x And x Invade.,111,La—
32867,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Lady Guanyin...
32868,Charge x And x Invade.,111,So...
32869,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Are you willing to defend your school?
32870,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I offer you my school.
32871,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Please accept me as a student!
32872,Charge x And x Invade.,111,A monster was born.
32873,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Sure, if you give me something to eat."
32874,Charge x And x Invade.,111,This happened over six decades ago.
32875,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Considering where his hands stopped, \Nthe attack shouldn't come from there..."
32876,Charge x And x Invade.,111,How?!
32877,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I hope that you will not return.
32878,Charge x And x Invade.,111,This will force me a long distance away!
32879,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Your Majesty!
32880,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Pouf!
32881,Charge x And x Invade.,111,He can't hear me... \NHe's too worried about the King.
32882,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Doctor Blythe!
32883,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"By its nature, this ability could \Nonly be used for healing."
32884,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Doctor Blythe cannot move from \Nits initial summoned position.
32885,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,"
32886,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Pitou must stay within twenty meters.
32887,Charge x And x Invade.,111,That restriction kept Pitou in the fight.
32888,Charge x And x Invade.,111,I've stopped?
32889,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Quickly...
32890,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Quickly!
32891,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Midnight
32892,Charge x And x Invade.,111,"There, they encountered someone they \Nhadn't counted on seeing at this point."
32893,Charge x And x Invade.,111,It was Youpi.
32894,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Next time: Monster x And x Monster.
32895,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Roar! I'm gonna eat you!
32896,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Go ahead and try!
32897,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Chomp.
32898,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Ow! Payback time!
32899,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Chomp chomp!
32900,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp chomp!
32901,Charge x And x Invade.,111,Chomp chomp!
32902,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Midnight
32903,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Monster x And x Monster
32904,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The moment Killua entered the palace...
32905,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I knew it!
32906,Monster x And x Monster.,112,...was his reaction.
32907,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"En{\i0 and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had \Nexpected to encounter on the first floor."
32908,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Despite the fact that they were now in a situation that was utterly \Nunforeseen in their planning,"
32909,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Killua's experience helped him stay calm.
32910,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Who are these guys?
32911,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Where did they come from?
32912,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"From Youpi's perspective, too, \Nhis current situation was an impossibility."
32913,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Youpi immediately ceased all thought.
32914,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I am a shield.
32915,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I protect the King with my body.
32916,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was \Ncreated from Magical Beasts, not humans."
32917,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Perhaps that was why he lacked the self-preservative \Nnature of the other two Royal Guard.
32918,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, that lack also gave him strength."
32919,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"The moment Youpi changed \Nforms with a belligerent smile,"
32920,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Shoot froze at once.
32921,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, it wasn't because \NShoot was slow to react."
32922,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"If I move any closer, he will attack."
32923,Monster x And x Monster.,112,And if his attack happens to connect with \Nthe invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...
32924,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself, he began to move his cage and floating arms..."
32925,Monster x And x Monster.,112,And then it happened.
32926,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This is Dragon Dive!
32927,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Then the old man's friend is...
32928,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Only Killua understood what was happening, and it momentarily froze him."
32929,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The shock was even greater to those \Nwho didn't know what was going on.
32930,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"There were only two present,"
32931,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Gon and Youpi, who remained focused \Non the enemy that faced them."
32932,Monster x And x Monster.,112,No way!
32933,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Has he lost it?
32934,Monster x And x Monster.,112,You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...
32935,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"No, wait."
32936,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Realization came a moment later to Killua, and still a few moments later to the others."
32937,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Seriously, even in this situation, how did he realize that, and so quickly?"
32938,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"If Meleoron and Knuckle were to \Nbe pierced by a Dragon Lance while God's Accomplice was \Nactive, and die instantly, would their invisibility cease?"
32939,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Nen{\i0
32940,Monster x And x Monster.,112,No one knew the answer.
32941,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Assuming the latter, confirming whether they \Nwere still alive would be impossible."
32942,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Meaning that, in the worst-case \Nscenario, someone else would have to deal with Youpi."
32943,Monster x And x Monster.,112,That should have been my job...
32944,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Gon!
32945,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Shoot did nothing wrong.
32946,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Even I was later than Killua \Nin noticing and reacting.
32947,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Shoot, don't blame yourself..."
32948,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Pull yourself together!
32949,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi, you're left with Pitou!"
32950,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However,"
32951,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Shoot was feeling a completely \Ndifferent emotion at that moment.
32952,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Gon!
32953,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I want to tell the entire world...
32954,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"""This is Gon!"
32955,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"A boy less than half my age, to whom I owe my life."""
32956,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"I've always gone to any lengths \Nto avoid facing danger and risk, hiding myself within a safe cage, \Nwhere no one could hurt me."
32957,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I hated myself for it...
32958,Monster x And x Monster.,112,But I couldn't change myself.
32959,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Friends and teachers encouraged me, but I never truly listened, \Nconsidering it the logic of the strong."
32960,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Yet somehow...
32961,Monster x And x Monster.,112,A boy with less than half my strength managed to break my cage!
32962,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Shoot did indeed tend to shrink \Nback weakly from opportunity.
32963,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I will survive...
32964,Monster x And x Monster.,112,So that I can thank you!
32965,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, even he didn't realize that such unique turns in his train of thought \Nmade him shine in the face of adversity."
32966,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Good!
32967,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Knuckle and Meleoron...
32968,Monster x And x Monster.,112,...are alive!
32969,Monster x And x Monster.,112,What?
32970,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Who was it that just attacked me?
32971,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I couldn't see a thing...
32972,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?
32973,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!"
32974,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Naturally, they had already tested \Nto confirm that God's Accomplice would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy."
32975,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"As long as God's Accomplice stayed active, \NYoupi would be unable to see APR."
32976,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question what had just happened, rather than \Nconcentrate on the enemies before him."
32977,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.
32978,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Which means my focus right now should be...
32979,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"So far, everything had proceeded \Naccording to the Hunters' plan."
32980,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, after a successful first strike, \NKnuckle could only shudder."
32981,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Seriously?
32982,Monster x And x Monster.,112,It's like his aura is unlimited!
32983,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"After surviving over five thousand battles,"
32984,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Knuckle had the experience and intuition \Nto quantify his opponent's strength.
32985,Monster x And x Monster.,112,It was not uncommon for him to \Nface enemies who were stronger than previous opponents he had encountered.
32986,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, there was no comparing \Nthe power he now faced to that of the opponents who had come before."
32987,Monster x And x Monster.,112,A monster with an immense amount of aura.
32988,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Five times what the boss has?
32989,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Ten times?
32990,Monster x And x Monster.,112,More?
32991,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I can't tell!
32992,Monster x And x Monster.,112,He had never experienced anything like this.
32993,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Assuming he's ten times stronger, with 700,000 aura, how long will it take before he goes bust?"
32994,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The King!
32995,Monster x And x Monster.,112,That was when the Hunters felt the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.
32996,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Youpi immediately noticed \Nthat momentary hesitation.
32997,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Your Majesty!
32998,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Your Majesty!
32999,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Since Pitou lacked wings, the only option was to continue free falling."
33000,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This was actually a stroke of luck.
33001,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Had there been unlimited courses of action,"
33002,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Pitou would have joined Pouf and \Nrushed straight toward the King, a Royal Guard's natural reaction."
33003,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"In that scenario, it's unlikely \Nthat Pitou would have had"
33004,Monster x And x Monster.,112,En{\i0
33005,Monster x And x Monster.,112,As a result...
33006,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The guest room on the second \Nfloor of the west tower...
33007,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The King is with the woman with closed eyes.
33008,Monster x And x Monster.,112,They're also using{\i0
33009,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This was when Pitou realized the \Nseriousness of the situation.
33010,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"In that instant, Pitou crouched like the \Nfour-legged creature of the Ant's origin, with upper legs tensing like steel until they were twice as large as they'd \Nbeen before the attack on Kite."
33011,Monster x And x Monster.,112,In order to reach the King before the enemy could.
33012,Monster x And x Monster.,112,But a second later...
33013,Monster x And x Monster.,112,A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination was strong enough to make \NPitou regret the decision.
33014,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This is... the King's...
33015,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"The aura coming from the King was so unmasked, his current state \Nof mind was plain to read."
33016,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"As a result, Pitou could only conclude that the situation had grown \Neven worse than previously thought."
33017,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The main stairway had collapsed!
33018,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"When the King looked down, \Ntime began to move again."
33019,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"However, time remained frozen for everyone else."
33020,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"The intruders, who had come for the King's life, were holding their breath and standing still because of the girl covered in blood."
33021,Monster x And x Monster.,112,And because the grotesque \Ncreature holding her body was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.
33022,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Pitou.
33023,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Y-Yes, sir."
33024,Monster x And x Monster.,112,The expression on the King's face \Nhad returned to normal.
33025,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This only increased Pitou's concern.
33026,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Heal Komugi.
33027,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I'm counting on you.
33028,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"The two veterans continued to stand by, silently watching their enemies, out of respect."
33029,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This was an act of love for a life.
33030,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Should they infringe upon that act, \Ntheir cause was lost."
33031,Monster x And x Monster.,112,It would have been inhumane.
33032,Monster x And x Monster.,112,This isn't what I was given to expect.
33033,Monster x And x Monster.,112,For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.
33034,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Netero felt the same way.
33035,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Not here.
33036,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Let us go elsewhere.
33037,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"I believe that a different location would be to your benefit, as well."
33038,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Netero had spent a great deal of money \Nto enlist Zeno to help separate the King from the Royal Guard.
33039,Monster x And x Monster.,112,He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.
33040,Monster x And x Monster.,112,However...
33041,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Well, I suppose."
33042,Monster x And x Monster.,112,He could not help but feel \Nhe had lost the initiative...
33043,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Doctor Blythe.
33044,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"The moment Pitou's ability was activated, the two men thought that their decision to lower their guard would prove fatal."
33045,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Because the King was able to walk \Nbetween them with ease.
33046,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster."
33047,Monster x And x Monster.,112,Next time: An x Indebted x Insect.
33048,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Gon, what are you eating?"
33049,Monster x And x Monster.,112,"Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects."
33050,Monster x And x Monster.,112,I-Insects that are candy?
33051,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The King!
33052,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,An x Indebted x Insect
33053,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.
33054,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"The central stairway was destroyed, with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend."
33055,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron, who had barely managed to \Nmake it to the second floor."
33056,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Below, the ones hit at closest range \Nby Youpi's attack were Shoot..."
33057,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,This is bad.
33058,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,My leg's destroyed.
33059,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Shoot!
33060,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,...and Morel.
33061,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The rest is up to you.
33062,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Knuckle...
33063,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.
33064,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Stupid tricks!
33065,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"One attack by Youpi tore apart the Deep Purple puppets, but Morel had deliberately \Npositioned them with that in mind."
33066,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,They were just decoys?
33067,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That resistance...
33068,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,This is more than smoke!
33069,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The weapon was the only \Nthing that wasn't smoke?
33070,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Fool! You won't get away!
33071,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"After using his own weapon as a decoy,"
33072,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Morel had no option left but to run.
33073,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,But...
33074,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.
33075,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!
33076,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That...
33077,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That punch was meant to send \Nhim flying over the horizon.
33078,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The total is 590?
33079,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...
33080,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage in the form of interest as time progresses \Nfrom the activation of the ability.
33081,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Lost sight of him...
33082,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Damn you!
33083,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The enraged Youpi returned to his senses because his multiple \Neyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.
33084,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"With his right leg broken,"
33085,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Shoot unconsciously used his remaining \Nleg to stand on one of his own fists.
33086,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Despite that he had never attempted it before,"
33087,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.
33088,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,And he had no clear reason \Nto cover his right eye.
33089,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,He was just enjoying the fact that he continued to gain strength \Nwhile the situation deteriorated.
33090,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Fueled by adversity itself,"
33091,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Shoot took flight.
33092,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,His tremendous speed and vigor succeeded in forcing Youpi to \Nconcentrate on defense for a few seconds.
33093,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,All in order to help the others.
33094,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Shoot, Knuckle..."
33095,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Once we finish this, first thing we do \Nis drink ourselves silly with good alcohol."
33096,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That's the only way I can get you guys \Nto let me give you a big hug.
33097,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The debris cloud raised by the destruction was the perfect cover for Morel to expand \Nhis smoke aura throughout the palace so he could monitor the course of the battle.
33098,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Morel's objective was the throne room.
33099,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,"
33100,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Gon and Killua evaded the attack \Nand changed direction.
33101,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"They planned to jump from the east tower's second floor to the central \Ntower's third floor, where the throne room was."
33102,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Upon hitting the ground, they passed \NIkalgo in the courtyard as he headed for the elevator underground."
33103,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"His ability that let him control corpses \Nlike part of his own body,"
33104,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Living Dead Dolls, granted him \Nthe use of multiple sets of eyes, which had allowed him to \Ndodge Dragon Dive unscratched."
33105,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted two soldier Ants in the direction that Ikalgo was headed."
33106,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"In the next moment, Killua had taken off."
33107,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Killua?
33108,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Why is he heading toward the elevator?
33109,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,What am I doing?
33110,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,What's wrong with me?
33111,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,It was only natural that Killua would \Nbe surprised by his own actions.
33112,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,He was the one who had instructed the others \Nto stick to their own tasks.
33113,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"At that point, Killua's mind completely froze."
33114,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"However, while his mind panicked, his body continued to move efficiently, keeping aura usage to a minimum, while swiftly and accurately gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities \Nand movements, and halting them."
33115,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Only Ikalgo and one other \Nsaw what had happened.
33116,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Damn...
33117,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,What have I done?
33118,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Killua,"
33119,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I owe you one.
33120,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"After he realized what he'd done, \Na tangle of emotions had left Killua lost in confusion, until Ikalgo's words woke him."
33121,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,"
33122,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Killua was already moving on.
33123,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Flutter?
33124,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Something's wrong.
33125,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"At either end of the hall leading to the \Nelevator underground were the servant quarters, which soldier Ants currently occupied."
33126,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Ikalgo raced past the two Ants, and at the moment when he reached the elevator, the doors at both ends opened simultaneously."
33127,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,From the doors appeared...
33128,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Cheetu...
33129,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Brovada!
33130,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"After seeing Flutter,"
33131,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled \Nthat something was wrong.
33132,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That was too fast.
33133,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Once they spotted the enemy, \Nthe two soldiers raised an alert."
33134,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Right afterward, they were killed."
33135,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The time between the intruder's \Nreturn down the hallway and Flutter's appearance was too short!
33136,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Which means they must have passed \None another in the hallway.
33137,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Then why were the soldiers killed, but not Flutter?"
33138,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Is Flutter on the enemy's side?
33139,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Meaning...
33140,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,He's a traitor!
33141,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Is he acting on his own, or..."
33142,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Is it Hagya's... Or rather...
33143,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Leol's orders?
33144,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,This is pathetic.
33145,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"When he needed me most, I wasn't there."
33146,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,And I call myself a Royal Guard?
33147,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I don't even know where the King is.
33148,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,And I call myself a Royal Guard?
33149,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,No.
33150,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I am a failure!
33151,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,It's that simple...
33152,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.
33153,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The ideals he prioritized were \Nunyielding and absolute.
33154,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Pouf, the former Royal Guard."
33155,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Now, Pouf..."
33156,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Useless Pouf...
33157,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You utter fool.
33158,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You failure of a Royal Guard!
33159,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Where will you go now?
33160,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You have no idea?
33161,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"And if the King isn't there, then you'll be more useless \Nthan scum, won't you?"
33162,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"No, useless Pouf..."
33163,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You just refuse to accept reality.
33164,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You don't want him spending \Ntime with that {\c&H0C00A7&
33165,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You don't want him spending \Ntime with that woman!
33166,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,His emotions were directed at \Nthe King as well as himself.
33167,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"An absolute King, feeling concern for a lowly human..."
33168,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...
33169,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,It is unforgivable!
33170,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,But...
33171,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That's probably where the King is...
33172,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Before I came here, I knew that much."
33173,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because \NI didn't know the King's location.
33174,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"I failed because I knew where, \Nand I didn't go there!"
33175,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum."
33176,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You are now a mere bug!
33177,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You can no longer expect anything of yourself.
33178,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Nor are you allowed, then, \Nto expect anything of the King!"
33179,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I can only work for the King...
33180,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,For the King... For the King... \NFor the King... For the King...
33181,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,For the King! For the King! For the King!
33182,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,For the King!
33183,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,For the King!
33184,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism, prevented him from thinking clearly in the \Nseconds after he arrived in the throne room."
33185,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I must go to the King.
33186,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Yo.
33187,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,You're gonna ignore me?!
33188,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,He goes straight to the King without a glance.
33189,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Unfortunately, you've been surrounded."
33190,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,What must I do to have you let me out?
33191,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"Oh, I'm not letting you out."
33192,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,I see...
33193,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Spiritual Message \N{\c&HA39CCA&
33194,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Spiritual Message.
33195,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,That's Morel's Smoky Jail...
33196,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,The ability he's using to separate \NPouf from the King.
33197,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"If the third floor of the tower \Nis surrounded by smoke, the King and Pitou aren't there."
33198,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Where are they?
33199,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Gon was raring to fight.
33200,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Next time: Divide x And x Conquer.
33201,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,"No, I don't wanna leave you!"
33202,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,It's okay! We're connected \Nby an invisible bond!
33203,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,There you go again—
33204,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Two sides of the same coin.
33205,An x Indebted x Insect.,113,Two peas in a pod!
33206,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,That's Morel's Smoky Jail...
33207,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,The ability he's using to separate \NPouf from the King.
33208,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If the third floor of the tower \Nis surrounded by smoke, the King and Pitou aren't there."
33209,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Where are they?
33210,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Divide x And x Conquer
33211,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Each has begun his own battle in his own respective location.
33212,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Gon...
33213,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Grandpa!
33214,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Which means that that's... the King!
33215,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Proceed.
33216,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I am fully aware that you seek \Nto accomplish your objective with minimal human casualties.
33217,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You took advantage of the chaos in the palace in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.
33218,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It makes no difference.
33219,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Proceed.
33220,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Dragon Head!
33221,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,He is frightening...
33222,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,The technique he unleashed was \Nnot intended to hurt the King.
33223,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,And both of them could tell that the King realized this at once.
33224,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Nen{\i0
33225,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...
33226,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Killua...
33227,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Pitou is over there.
33228,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Let's go!
33229,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Let's go...
33230,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,In what sense did you mean that?
33231,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Killua barely managed to stop himself \Nfrom asking the question.
33232,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If I ask that question,"
33233,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I won't be able to stop anymore...
33234,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I won't be able to go back.
33235,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer."
33236,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Anyone with enough experience \Nwould easily arrive at that next step.
33237,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,But the fear of losing someone he cared for prevented him from taking that step.
33238,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"A few moments before the dragon took flight,"
33239,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Cheetu and Brovada appeared before Ikalgo.
33240,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Hey, it's Flutter."
33241,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,What's with all the noise?
33242,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,En{\i0
33243,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I just returned...
33244,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It seems the enemy is attacking.
33245,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Seriously?
33246,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this."
33247,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,What happened to your wings?
33248,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Oh, uh..."
33249,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"I lost them earlier, during the attack."
33250,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Are you going underground?
33251,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama."
33252,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,What should we do?
33253,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Well, we weren't told to defend this place..."
33254,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,But I'm just itching to try my new technique.
33255,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It's huge...
33256,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,That looks fun!
33257,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'm gonna check it out!
33258,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Be careful!
33259,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'm gonna see what's going on!
33260,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Then, I'll be going."
33261,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Okay.
33262,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"""Hagya-sama""?"
33263,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Meanwhile, in the throne room, \Nin the central tower..."
33264,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Is it truly possible to trap me in one place?
33265,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Why don't we find out?
33266,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Wing scales...
33267,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Knov said that they can hypnotize people.
33268,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I don't want to inhale any...
33269,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You seem to be finished talking.
33270,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I would expect that of anyone \Nwith considerable power.
33271,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,However...
33272,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Caution, resolve, and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio."
33273,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,His caution isn't as strong \Nbecause he's confident.
33274,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It's safe to say he has a strong personality.
33275,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Pouf's Spiritual Message surrounds his opponent with wing scales, \Nmaking their aura more opaque, letting him sense their state of mind."
33276,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I suppose I should introduce myself.
33277,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard."
33278,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,His caution has increased slightly.
33279,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You won't tell me your name?
33280,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If you believe that I'm trying to trick you into inhaling my wing \Nscales, you're sadly mistaken."
33281,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"And to be honest, I'm a little shocked."
33282,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"After a rebirth, all will be forgotten."
33283,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'll need you to wait a moment.
33284,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me."
33285,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...
33286,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Shoot was fighting recklessly, \Nwithout concern for his life, which turned out to be the \Nreason he was still alive."
33287,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Hotel Rafflesia...
33288,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"While barely dodging multiple attacks that \Nwould have been otherwise lethal,"
33289,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Shoot had only managed to take \Nthe eye on Youpi's shoulder.
33290,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,He had essentially done no damage.
33291,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,However...
33292,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.
33293,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"The strange sensation that his momentum \Nwas being stolen, rather than stopped, influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously."
33294,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"After taking multiple hits from \Nattacks he didn't understand,"
33295,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Youpi was backing up.
33296,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I can't let this guy near the King.
33297,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Every second I keep him away \Nfrom the King counts.
33298,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.
33299,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"However, this expected turn of events was difficult on Knuckle..."
33300,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Hold it in...
33301,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I can't attack now!
33302,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting that there's one more enemy \Nhe needs to worry about!"
33303,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Hold it in!
33304,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Shoot was now covered in blood, as he endured Youpi's ferocious \Nbarrage of attacks."
33305,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Forced to watch from the sidelines, just remaining hidden was a battle."
33306,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,No matter how he told himself to keep still...
33307,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Hold it in... Please hold it in!
33308,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Knuckle was unable to hold back the \Ntears streaming down his face.
33309,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You can do it!
33310,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It's time.
33311,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Adding interest.
33312,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Only ten seconds have passed?
33313,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You're kidding!
33314,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"How much longer do I have to endure \Nthis suffocating, excruciating wait that makes me want to do nothing but run away?"
33315,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,This must be some kind of joke...
33316,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,And it isn't funny!
33317,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I can't hold it in any longer!
33318,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Knuckle's rampage was halted by the first tap from Meleoron.
33319,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!
33320,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,But that just might have saved me.
33321,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.
33322,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"He, too, had reached his limit."
33323,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Crap!
33324,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Uh-oh.
33325,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"He barely scratched me, but it \Nwas enough damage to offset the interest and \Nmy full-strength attack."
33326,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Shoot is risking his life out there, while I'm standing here unhurt, \Nand making stupid mistakes!"
33327,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything, nor did he notice APR's declaration \Nof returned interest."
33328,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Damn!
33329,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either."
33330,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Calm down, you fool..."
33331,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,You're gonna ruin everything.
33332,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Here's the distance where we want to stay...
33333,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Not close enough for him to find us, \Nbut close enough to get in fast."
33334,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"He'll notice APR for a second, \Nbut that's no problem."
33335,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Shoot's fighting hard, so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron."
33336,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,God's Accomplice...
33337,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Undo.
33338,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,What is this thing?
33339,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,When did it show up?
33340,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"No, it can't be that I didn't notice it."
33341,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It just suddenly appeared.
33342,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Was I hit by an attack?
33343,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"No, I wasn't."
33344,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,A delayed effect?
33345,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,So it must have been then!
33346,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Does that mean the condition \Nwas met during the fight?
33347,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,What is this number?
33348,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Is it a countdown? A bomb?
33349,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"No, the number isn't going up or down."
33350,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,This is too much of a pain!
33351,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I only need to destroy the source!
33352,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Something's coming.
33353,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Despite his overwhelming power, one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot was the evident difference in \Nskill level between them."
33354,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It's fast... I can't get away!
33355,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,One skewered chunk of meat coming up!
33356,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,He hit himself to accelerate.
33357,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Very well...
33358,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,That was close.
33359,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,The reaction to the attack told Youpi \Nthat he could win at any moment.
33360,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy, so this spurred him on."
33361,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Youpi's analysis was on the mark.
33362,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,It was true that Youpi was \Nincreasingly likely to win this fight.
33363,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"If he made any mistake, it was not realizing that Shoot was fine with this fact."
33364,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I can keep going...
33365,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I... can still fly.
33366,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'm not done...
33367,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"However, quietly and surely..."
33368,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Shoot was reaching his limit.
33369,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Hey, Youpi!"
33370,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Over here, fool!"
33371,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Knuckle!
33372,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'm telling him that there's one \Nmore enemy to worry about?
33373,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,That's fine.
33374,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"That will serve to distract Youpi, and it will save Shoot."
33375,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Bring it!
33376,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"After calming down and regaining composure,"
33377,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Knuckle decided to show himself.
33378,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Next time: Duty x And x Question.
33379,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Huh? Where are you, Gon?"
33380,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Over here.
33381,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,"Gon! Wait, you disappeared again!"
33382,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,Perfect Plan... Undo!
33383,Divide x And x Conquer.,114,I'm always by your side.
33384,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Hey, Youpi!"
33385,Duty x And x Question.,115,"I'm over here, fool!"
33386,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'm telling him that there's one \Nmore enemy to worry about?
33387,Duty x And x Question.,115,That's fine.
33388,Duty x And x Question.,115,"That will serve to distract Youpi, and it will save Shoot."
33389,Duty x And x Question.,115,Duty x And x Question
33390,Duty x And x Question.,115,"""Hagya-sama."""
33391,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Ikalgo didn't realize that the name \Nhe had spoken with full confidence had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions, as he headed beneath the palace to search for Palm."
33392,Duty x And x Question.,115,Satellite Dragonflies!
33393,Duty x And x Question.,115,Ikalgo knew Palm only through the \Ninformation he had been given.
33394,Duty x And x Question.,115,"However, he was already firm in his resolve that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her."
33395,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'm gonna rescue her.
33396,Duty x And x Question.,115,Palm is a friend of a friend.
33397,Duty x And x Question.,115,That makes her a friend...
33398,Duty x And x Question.,115,My friend!
33399,Duty x And x Question.,115,Palm was risking her life.
33400,Duty x And x Question.,115,That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.
33401,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.
33402,Duty x And x Question.,115,I want to help her...
33403,Duty x And x Question.,115,Because I decided I would help her!
33404,Duty x And x Question.,115,The elevator leading underground was equipped with a security camera and a scale.
33405,Duty x And x Question.,115,"After arriving underground, it would confirm that there was nothing inside before automatically returning to the surface."
33406,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Any number of people could descend at once, but only one could ascend at a time."
33407,Duty x And x Question.,115,And a pass code had to be entered.
33408,Duty x And x Question.,115,"The eight-digit code varied per person, \Nand could be used to identify who had used the elevator."
33409,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If the user's height and weight \Ndo not match the data on record from the time the code \Nwas assigned, a warning sounded, and the elevator became a prison."
33410,Duty x And x Question.,115,"On the first entry of an incorrect code, \Na warning sounded, and the doors locked."
33411,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted, the elevator filled with sleeping gas, \Nand the violator was captured and tortured."
33412,Duty x And x Question.,115,"In other words, a third error meant death."
33413,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Both the violator and the code's \Noriginal owner would be killed, making one's code as valuable as one's own life."
33414,Duty x And x Question.,115,And the only code holders able to use the elevator without \Nany such restriction were Bizeff and Marcos.
33415,Duty x And x Question.,115,"That was because the elevator \Nwas a more convenient means of smuggling in various things, including humans, than the cargo entrance, \Nwhich was watched by soldiers."
33416,Duty x And x Question.,115,What is this smell?!
33417,Duty x And x Question.,115,Has Flutter been living in the morgue?
33418,Duty x And x Question.,115,"I can also smell Bro, since he was the last one in here before me."
33419,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Damn, there's something else, very faint..."
33420,Duty x And x Question.,115,The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served to dull Welfin's sense of smell.
33421,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Since Bro followed Flutter underground, he must have also noticed that Flutter \Nused the name ""Hagya-sama."""
33422,Duty x And x Question.,115,Or is Brovada conspiring with him?
33423,Duty x And x Question.,115,"When I was watching the intruder, was Bro watching me from behind?"
33424,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If he was, and if he's working with the intruder, then he must have seen that \NI noticed Flutter's odd behavior..."
33425,Duty x And x Question.,115,"So, he went down first..."
33426,Duty x And x Question.,115,In order to ambush me!
33427,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Damn, this is my chance!"
33428,Duty x And x Question.,115,Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.
33429,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If I can pass him off him as the \Nbomb threat's perpetrator,"
33430,Duty x And x Question.,115,Bizeff will be indebted to me!
33431,Duty x And x Question.,115,Bizeff!
33432,Duty x And x Question.,115,Where's Bizeff?
33433,Duty x And x Question.,115,This is bad...
33434,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If he dies during the attack, \Nmy plans will be ruined!"
33435,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!"
33436,Duty x And x Question.,115,Yo.
33437,Duty x And x Question.,115,Grandpa...
33438,Duty x And x Question.,115,He's changed.
33439,Duty x And x Question.,115,My job here is done.
33440,Duty x And x Question.,115,I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
33441,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'll let you draw your own conclusions \Nabout what's happening inside.
33442,Duty x And x Question.,115,Inside?
33443,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Swallowing the words he wanted to say,"
33444,Duty x And x Question.,115,Zeno disappeared into the darkness.
33445,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,"
33446,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Knuckle has revealed himself, a move \Nthat was not part of the original plan."
33447,Duty x And x Question.,115,Meleoron and Shoot could only hold their breaths.
33448,Duty x And x Question.,115,Bring it!
33449,Duty x And x Question.,115,Bring it!
33450,Duty x And x Question.,115,I see... Then this is yours.
33451,Duty x And x Question.,115,It's time.
33452,Duty x And x Question.,115,Adding interest.
33453,Duty x And x Question.,115,The number increased?
33454,Duty x And x Question.,115,My attacks won't work?
33455,Duty x And x Question.,115,What is this thing?
33456,Duty x And x Question.,115,Don't you run!
33457,Duty x And x Question.,115,Answer me!
33458,Duty x And x Question.,115,What is this thing?!
33459,Duty x And x Question.,115,"I ain't gonna tell you, fool!"
33460,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If you wanna know, catch me first!"
33461,Duty x And x Question.,115,Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...
33462,Duty x And x Question.,115,I can't weave through those \Nblades of death to get to him!
33463,Duty x And x Question.,115,"In that case, I'll walk at a pace \Nthat's neither fast nor slow, to conserve as much oxygen as possible!"
33464,Duty x And x Question.,115,I must not lose consciousness...
33465,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If I pass out,"
33466,Duty x And x Question.,115,Hotel Rafflesia will stop...
33467,Duty x And x Question.,115,Every little bit of damage counts...
33468,Duty x And x Question.,115,I can still fight...
33469,Duty x And x Question.,115,I can still...
33470,Duty x And x Question.,115,I can't... I just can't say it!
33471,Duty x And x Question.,115,I can't tell Shoot to keep fighting!
33472,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Right now, my job... isn't to help Shoot!"
33473,Duty x And x Question.,115,"It's to use my power to help the others, so they can complete their \Nmissions as fast as possible!"
33474,Duty x And x Question.,115,"You have to survive, Shoot!"
33475,Duty x And x Question.,115,Don't die!
33476,Duty x And x Question.,115,No one's here.
33477,Duty x And x Question.,115,Stay calm...
33478,Duty x And x Question.,115,Look around carefully.
33479,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If I'm caught, I can still pretend \Nto be on their side."
33480,Duty x And x Question.,115,However...
33481,Duty x And x Question.,115,"That might not work, depending on who I run into."
33482,Duty x And x Question.,115,Perfect Plan... Undo!
33483,Duty x And x Question.,115,Okay!
33484,Duty x And x Question.,115,Activate!
33485,Duty x And x Question.,115,That's Morel's Smoky Jail.
33486,Duty x And x Question.,115,Which means...
33487,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Morel and Pouf are dueling it out in the throne \Nroom, with no possibility of interruption!"
33488,Duty x And x Question.,115,That only leaves...
33489,Duty x And x Question.,115,Gon and Killua!
33490,Duty x And x Question.,115,Where are they? Where are Gon and Killua?
33491,Duty x And x Question.,115,Which way did they go?
33492,Duty x And x Question.,115,Welfin?!
33493,Duty x And x Question.,115,Crap!
33494,Duty x And x Question.,115,He's tough to deal with...
33495,Duty x And x Question.,115,He's the most skeptical of the Squadron Leaders!
33496,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Once he suspects you, he won't \Ntrust you again until you're dead!"
33497,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?
33498,Duty x And x Question.,115,Which way do I go?
33499,Duty x And x Question.,115,What if he goes the same way?
33500,Duty x And x Question.,115,Do I wait for him to leave?
33501,Duty x And x Question.,115,Can I hold my breath that much longer?
33502,Duty x And x Question.,115,No... I can't hold it!
33503,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'm at my limit!
33504,Duty x And x Question.,115,I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!
33505,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Perfect Plan, undo!"
33506,Duty x And x Question.,115,Now inhale...
33507,Duty x And x Question.,115,Activate!
33508,Duty x And x Question.,115,"For a second, I sensed something."
33509,Duty x And x Question.,115,The enemy?
33510,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Welfin's power reflected his very nature, channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon."
33511,Duty x And x Question.,115,Egg Man \N{\fs20
33512,Duty x And x Question.,115,Missile Man!
33513,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If anyone's hiding behind the building, surrender and show yourself by \Nthe time I count down from three!"
33514,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If you don't, I'll attack!"
33515,Duty x And x Question.,115,Three!
33516,Duty x And x Question.,115,Two!
33517,Duty x And x Question.,115,One!
33518,Duty x And x Question.,115,Fire!
33519,Duty x And x Question.,115,No one's there... Did I imagine it?
33520,Duty x And x Question.,115,"To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target and loads ammo in the form \Nof questions or commands."
33521,Duty x And x Question.,115,"If someone answers falsely or disobeys, \Nthe attack is launched."
33522,Duty x And x Question.,115,"By the time Welfin noticed a presence, \NMeleoron had already moved."
33523,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Had Meleoron stayed in the same place, his attack would have succeeded, \Ndespite his inability to detect his target."
33524,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Finding nothing fitting the target's \Ndescription, the attack failed."
33525,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Once fired, Missile Man will \Npursue its target until it hits."
33526,Duty x And x Question.,115,No one can survive the impact.
33527,Duty x And x Question.,115,"However, Welfin understood that \Nhis ability wasn't omnipotent."
33528,Duty x And x Question.,115,His power was nothing more than a tool.
33529,Duty x And x Question.,115,Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.
33530,Duty x And x Question.,115,"He sought to become the king behind the scenes, because being the real king would mean\N he'd have too much to be suspicious of."
33531,Duty x And x Question.,115,It was my imagination?
33532,Duty x And x Question.,115,"No, wait..."
33533,Duty x And x Question.,115,I smell odorless deodorant...
33534,Duty x And x Question.,115,You can't fool my nose.
33535,Duty x And x Question.,115,Someone was here! I know it!
33536,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Since I could only sense them for a moment, \Nthey must be very skilled."
33537,Duty x And x Question.,115,The use of deodorant confirms \Nthat they're aware of my nose.
33538,Duty x And x Question.,115,This confirms that there are traitors among us!
33539,Duty x And x Question.,115,There are others besides Flutter?
33540,Duty x And x Question.,115,The answer is probably yes!
33541,Duty x And x Question.,115,And it's someone I know...
33542,Duty x And x Question.,115,That's why they're hiding their scent.
33543,Duty x And x Question.,115,Who is it?
33544,Duty x And x Question.,115,They don't want to fight me?
33545,Duty x And x Question.,115,Because they can take me out at any time?
33546,Duty x And x Question.,115,Do I...
33547,Duty x And x Question.,115,Do I...
33548,Duty x And x Question.,115,Do I really want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?
33549,Duty x And x Question.,115,Should I really be searching for Bizeff now?
33550,Duty x And x Question.,115,As Welfin began to doubt his own objectives...
33551,Duty x And x Question.,115,"Gon and Killua had finally found Neferpitou, their target for avenging Kite."
33552,Duty x And x Question.,115,Next time: Revenge x And x Recovery.
33553,Duty x And x Question.,115,Meleoron!
33554,Duty x And x Question.,115,Ikalgo.
33555,Duty x And x Question.,115,Knuckle!
33556,Duty x And x Question.,115,Shoot.
33557,Duty x And x Question.,115,Morel-san!
33558,Duty x And x Question.,115,Knov.
33559,Duty x And x Question.,115,Palm!
33560,Duty x And x Question.,115,Gon.
33561,Duty x And x Question.,115,Killua...
33562,Duty x And x Question.,115,"No matter what happens, always have faith."
33563,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The Hunters have entered the palace in \Norder to defeat the Chimera Ant King.
33564,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,My attacks don't work?
33565,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What is this thing?
33566,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Don't you run!
33567,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Answer me!
33568,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What is this thing?!
33569,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"I ain't gonna tell you, fool!"
33570,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If you wanna know, catch me first!"
33571,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"To save the injured Shoot,"
33572,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Knuckle taunted Youpi to draw his attention.
33573,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Knuckle's planning to fight Youpi alone...
33574,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can't weave through those \Nblades of death to get to him!
33575,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,In that case...
33576,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I must not lose consciousness...
33577,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If I pass out,"
33578,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Hotel Rafflesia will stop...
33579,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Every little bit of damage counts...
33580,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can still fight...
33581,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can still...
33582,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Right now, my job... isn't to help Shoot!"
33583,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"It's to use my power to help the others, so they can complete their \Nmissions as fast as possible!"
33584,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Though it broke his heart, \NMeleoron had to leave the two Hunters and follow Gon and Killua instead, \Nin order to fulfill his mission."
33585,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into \Nthe depths of the palace to rescue Palm."
33586,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Satellite Dragonflies!
33587,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm gonna rescue her.
33588,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Palm is a friend of a friend.
33589,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That makes her a friend...
33590,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,My friend!
33591,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"As Morel, the first Hunter \Nto reach the throne room, waited to continue his battle with Pouf, \Nwho remained in his cocoon,"
33592,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Netero and the King were leaving the palace, and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou, their target for avenging Kite."
33593,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Revenge x And x Recovery
33594,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Do you remember me?
33595,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm Gon Freecss!
33596,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I came here to get Kite back from you!
33597,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.
33598,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The only thing on Pitou's mind was \Nsurviving the current threat while carrying out the King's order.
33599,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.
33600,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I must protect Komugi...
33601,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,At any cost!
33602,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Something's not right.
33603,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Watching from a short distance, Killua \Nnoticed that something was strange."
33604,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Why isn't the enemy preparing for \Nbattle when we're right here?
33605,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can't sense any aura at all...
33606,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou might as well be completely \Nnaked... Utterly defenseless.
33607,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Does Pitou think it can win without aura?
33608,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"No, that isn't possible."
33609,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The aura coming from Gon now \Ndoesn't even compare to his usual.
33610,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116, Nen.
33611,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Is it because of where we are?
33612,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,"
33613,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Nen{\i1
33614,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That's possible.
33615,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"However, for some reason..."
33616,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That doesn't seem to be it.
33617,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,It almost looks like...
33618,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That's it.
33619,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,It looks like... a mother using its own body to guard something weaker.
33620,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That's ridiculous.
33621,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!
33622,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"But then, why did Grandpa..."
33623,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'll let you draw your own conclusions \Nabout what's happening inside.
33624,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,...say something that cryptic?
33625,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"While Killua was fighting his natural instincts, the girl lying before them brought back images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind."
33626,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Get away from her.
33627,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm telling you to take that \Nmonster and get away from her.
33628,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"And then, fight me!"
33629,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Fight me, so I can get Kite back!"
33630,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The act of placing both palms face-up \Nto display one's lack of malice was a gesture Killua recognized...
33631,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Please wait.
33632,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What the hell?!
33633,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What am I supposed to wait for?
33634,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Get up! We're going outside!
33635,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance left Gon without a target for his rage.
33636,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully \Nunderstanding the current situation."
33637,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,It was...
33638,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
33639,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,He was saying something \Nunexpected happened!
33640,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Grandpa knew nothing when \Nhe brought the dragon down.
33641,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Grandpa's mission was probably to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to \Nseparate the King and Royal Guard.
33642,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"But he didn't know that she was here, too."
33643,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Wait, this woman must be the third party that none of us knew about!"
33644,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,And she's most likely the reason the King hurt himself.
33645,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Why would the King do something \Nso out of character?
33646,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Because she is someone \Nwho's special to the King.
33647,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou isn't taking her apart.
33648,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou is healing her at the King's command!
33649,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116, En {\i1
33650,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,All aura must be focused on \Nhealing ability when using it.
33651,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"However, Killua knew that this \Ninformation would only have a negative effect on Gon."
33652,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What do I do?
33653,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What do I tell him?
33654,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Go—
33655,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'll do anything!
33656,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'll do anything you say!
33657,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,So please wait.
33658,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I... must save this person!
33659,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Save...
33660,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Save what?
33661,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"""Anything""?"
33662,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"When you say ""anything""..."
33663,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Killua...
33664,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm asking the questions.
33665,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,What is it that you must save?
33666,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Amidst the extreme tension, \Nthe answer Pitou chose to give was..."
33667,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,This person is someone...
33668,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Someone who's important \Nto someone important to me.
33669,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,...the truth.
33670,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,She is the reason the King is who he is.
33671,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is."
33672,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,She's that important.
33673,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,So...
33674,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,All I care about is saving her!
33675,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want."
33676,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,So please wait!
33677,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,You want to save her?
33678,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,You must save her?
33679,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Save her?
33680,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,How dare you say that...
33681,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,How dare you?!
33682,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Damn it!
33683,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The hell if...
33684,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,The hell if I'll listen to you!
33685,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Gon, hold on!"
33686,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,It's likely that we were \Nthe ones that injured her.
33687,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.
33688,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,And?
33689,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pitou is probably telling the \Ntruth about healing her.
33690,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,So?
33691,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Let's wait until it's done.
33692,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"""Likely""?"
33693,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"""Probably""?"
33694,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"You want me to wait because \Nof ""likely"" and ""probably""?"
33695,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"And after we wait, it's likely that this thing will do what I want?"
33696,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Likely? Probably?
33697,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Seriously?!
33698,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That's crap!
33699,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That's just crap!
33700,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Is something wrong with you?!
33701,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,You want... You want me to trust this thing?!
33702,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can't do that!
33703,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If you want, you may also have my right arm..."
33704,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If that isn't enough, you can take both legs..."
33705,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If you're worried I'll change my mind \Nafter the healing finishes, you can break any part of my body \Nthat isn't required to heal her."
33706,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Please let me save her!
33707,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,That isn't fair...
33708,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"That isn't fair, damn it!"
33709,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Why are you helping her, after everything you did to Kite?!"
33710,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Gon!
33711,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Why?!
33712,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Why?!
33713,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,To hell with that.
33714,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,First comes—
33715,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Gon, if you kill Pitou, we'll never get Kite back."
33716,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"You have it easy, Killua."
33717,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,You're perfectly calm.
33718,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Since it means nothing to you...
33719,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm only saying this because \Nyou're out of control.
33720,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Did you forget the first thing \Nyou said when we came here?
33721,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,We're here to get Kite back!
33722,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Pull it together!
33723,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Yeah.
33724,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'm okay now.
33725,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,How long?
33726,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,How long do I have to wait?
33727,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,To completely heal her will take three to four hours.
33728,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"No, I can't wait that long."
33729,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"If I have an hour,"
33730,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can heal her most critical injuries.
33731,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Please give me that.
33732,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"In one hour, you're coming with \Nme to Peijing, to heal Kite."
33733,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Can you promise me that?
33734,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I swear to keep that promise!
33735,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I'll wait right here for one hour.
33736,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,Next time: Insult x And x Payback.
33737,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I can't think of anything right now...
33738,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,"Killua, insult me back!"
33739,Revenge x And x Recovery.,116,I... feel better now.
33740,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Why?!
33741,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"You have it easy, Killua."
33742,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You're perfectly calm.
33743,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Since it means nothing to you...
33744,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Gon's cry had guided \NMeleoron to the two boys.
33745,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Insult x And x Payback
33746,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I'm going to have to refuse.
33747,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Right now, I'm not in the mood."
33748,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Come on, don't say that."
33749,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!
33750,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Let me test my new technique on you.
33751,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"That hurts, man..."
33752,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You don't have to give me such a dirty look.
33753,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"The one I really want to fight \Nis someone else, you know."
33754,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"That guy with sunglasses, \Ncarrying the big pipe."
33755,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Aren't you with him?
33756,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Then, why don't you go and find him?"
33757,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I know where he is.
33758,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But I can't get to him.
33759,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"He controls smoke, and he's hidden \Nhimself behind a smokescreen."
33760,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And I can't get through.
33761,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"I climbed up to the roof, to see \Nif I could get in from above..."
33762,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And I happened to spot you.
33763,Insult x And x Payback.,117,So I'm supposed to be the warm-up \Nbefore your main fight?
33764,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Bingo!
33765,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I've had it for today...
33766,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Will you listen to what I have to say?
33767,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"For the first time since taking \Nover the family business,"
33768,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.
33769,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Dude, my technique is awesome!"
33770,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Don't be too shocked when you see it.
33771,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Well, you'll still be shocked in the end..."
33772,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You're a self-centered fellow.
33773,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Doesn't look like I'll be able to \Npersuade you to let me go.
33774,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Bingo and bingo!
33775,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You should watch your back.
33776,Insult x And x Payback.,117,What an old trick!
33777,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I won't fall for that!
33778,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Your buddy told me to keep \Nmy eyes on my oppone—
33779,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Well, the result would have \Nbeen the same either way."
33780,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Should I have spared him?
33781,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Not necessary.
33782,Insult x And x Payback.,117,How's Killua doing?
33783,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Hmm? He's matured.
33784,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.
33785,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I see.
33786,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Oh, that's right..."
33787,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I had a rare experience today.
33788,Insult x And x Payback.,117,My time was compressed!
33789,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I must remember to ignore \Nhalf of everything you say.
33790,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Okay, we should be safe here."
33791,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Explain what's going on.
33792,Insult x And x Payback.,117,God's Accomplice... Undo!
33793,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Shoot's out of the battle, \Nand Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone."
33794,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I need your help...
33795,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Knuckle's going to keep running, \Nto try and buy time."
33796,Insult x And x Payback.,117,He's crazy!
33797,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Okay, what's the minimum length of time \Nyou can maintain God's Accomplice?"
33798,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"The first time, I was so nervous, I failed \Nand had to tap out after ten seconds."
33799,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But I've regained my cool.
33800,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"If I don't move, I can hold my \Nbreath for at least a minute!"
33801,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That's plenty of time.
33802,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I just need one chance.
33803,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Approximately three minutes \Nbefore Killua raised his finger...
33804,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Knuckle was airborne.
33805,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest \Npoint was his ability to run away."
33806,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Once, to help his friends escape, he knocked out a cop, and eluded four patrol cars and dozens \Nof police for a full day and night, on foot."
33807,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The day he finally escaped was the day he graduated from grade school.
33808,Insult x And x Payback.,117,His stamina when maintaining top speed far exceeds that of a cheetah.
33809,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen to reveal himself and use an out-boxing \Nstrategy against Youpi."
33810,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"For the most part, it was the right choice."
33811,Insult x And x Payback.,117,He stopped chasing me?
33812,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"If there was one thing he miscalculated, \Nit was his opponent's intentions."
33813,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot's in trouble! Crap!
33814,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot and Knuckle considered \NYoupi a high-priority target.
33815,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.
33816,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"As a Royal Guard, protecting the \NKing was his mission."
33817,Insult x And x Payback.,117,His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.
33818,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Youpi still believed the King \Nto be in the throne room.
33819,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"And since guarding the stairway \Nwas his assignment, he was convinced that Pitou and \NPouf were protecting the King."
33820,Insult x And x Payback.,117,So his main priority was to keep enemies \Naway from the throne room.
33821,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Since he didn't know how \Nmany enemies there were, the nature of his opponent's \Nability took second priority."
33822,Insult x And x Payback.,117,As did any enemies running or dying.
33823,Insult x And x Payback.,117,They did not warrant his concern.
33824,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Hey! Pitou!
33825,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot!
33826,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot was still alive.
33827,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot...
33828,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Given their positions, when Youpi turned back, he must have spotted Shoot."
33829,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Then we aren't even worth... finishing off?
33830,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.
33831,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"After having fought him with all they had, the pair had never felt so humiliated."
33832,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Are Shoot and I no more than flies?!
33833,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Fine, then!"
33834,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You're gonna regret this!
33835,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"In a few more minutes, \Nthis fly will send you flying!"
33836,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Pitou! Pouf!
33837,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Are you there?
33838,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.
33839,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That means he and Pouf are alone inside.
33840,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The King isn't in the throne room!
33841,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Say something! Can't you hear me?
33842,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Hey!
33843,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You fool...
33844,Insult x And x Payback.,117,You're free to defend an empty throne room!
33845,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance."
33846,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Damn it...
33847,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"By the time Knuckle realized his mistake, he had already made another."
33848,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.
33849,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shoot must have been prepared \Nto die at that moment.
33850,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That's the kind of fight we came for.
33851,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But he ignored Shoot...
33852,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"When Knuckle pictured the \Nexpression on Youpi's face after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot \Nand headed up to the third floor,"
33853,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Knuckle realized his new mistake.
33854,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Damn it.
33855,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Damn it...
33856,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Am I supposed to ignore the fact \Nthat my buddy's been humiliated?
33857,Insult x And x Payback.,117,For what reason?
33858,Insult x And x Payback.,117,For the world?
33859,Insult x And x Payback.,117,For humanity?
33860,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"And if our mission succeeds, \NI just shake Shoot's hand and say,"
33861,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"""We did it""?"
33862,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?
33863,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Even though he was humiliated?
33864,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I can't do that!
33865,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That isn't right...
33866,Insult x And x Payback.,117,C-Come on...
33867,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Oh, sorry."
33868,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"And while I'm apologizing, I need \Nyou to wait here a little longer!"
33869,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I need to punch that guy in the face...
33870,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And I'll throw another punch for you!
33871,Insult x And x Payback.,117,It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...
33872,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"""Have you lost your mind?"
33873,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Don't go.
33874,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time."""
33875,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That is my...
33876,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Do it, Knuckle!"
33877,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Damn it!
33878,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That bastard...
33879,Insult x And x Payback.,117,He...
33880,Insult x And x Payback.,117,He... looked at me like I was trash!
33881,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Give that bastard an extra punch for me...
33882,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Yeah, I got it!"
33883,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Sorry, master..."
33884,Insult x And x Payback.,117,We're both fools.
33885,Insult x And x Payback.,117,There's something more important \Nthan the world right now!
33886,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Knuckle's new mistake was a misjudgment of his priorities.
33887,Insult x And x Payback.,117,My attacks aren't having any \Neffect on this smoke...
33888,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Your Majesty!
33889,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Pitou! Pouf!
33890,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Are you there? Hey!
33891,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Is that Youpi?
33892,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Were they both defeated?
33893,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I hope the old man's doing okay...
33894,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Why isn't Pouf responding?
33895,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Something's wrong.
33896,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Why is he staying inside his cocoon?
33897,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I would have expected him to be in \Nmore of a hurry to get to the King.
33898,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Could we have made... some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?
33899,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Is our operation actually working?
33900,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Don't think about it!
33901,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I'm here to fulfill my mission!
33902,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Doubt, worry, impatience..."
33903,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Negative emotions are growing, \Nbut his resolve has not faltered."
33904,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.
33905,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I'm impressed.
33906,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"However, that will be the constraint \Nthat weakens your decision-making."
33907,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Damn...
33908,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Why is Pitou's{\i0
33909,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?"
33910,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Leaving me behind?
33911,Insult x And x Payback.,117,What happened?
33912,Insult x And x Payback.,117,What's going on?
33913,Insult x And x Payback.,117,It's time.
33914,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Adding interest.
33915,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Shut up!
33916,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.
33917,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And the number on this thing keeps increasing.
33918,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I have to find the King!
33919,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs."
33920,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That might have gotten rid of this fog.
33921,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But I have to find the King!
33922,Insult x And x Payback.,117,What's going on?!
33923,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I'm getting annoyed!
33924,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Yo.
33925,Insult x And x Payback.,117,What the hell is wrong with all of you?!
33926,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"And with that shout, Youpi transformed."
33927,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"It was drastic enough to make Knuckle, \Nwho thought he had come prepared, instantly switch from an offensive \Nstance to an evasive one."
33928,Insult x And x Payback.,117,This manifestation of evil clearly meant only to destroy.
33929,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Hang on!
33930,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Did you... hit him?
33931,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Eh?
33932,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Did you hit him... for me?
33933,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Not yet, damn it!"
33934,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"I'll hit him hard, so hold on!"
33935,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"But we have to run, so we don't die first!"
33936,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"For the first time in his life,"
33937,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.
33938,Insult x And x Payback.,117,This had made it apparent that his power was not meant for guarding the King.
33939,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Rather, he realized that his violent rage could fuel a rapid increase in the \Nmass of both his body and his aura."
33940,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"The destruction brought him great pleasure, after which his body rapidly shrank, \Nand he felt a strong sense of loss."
33941,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Knuckle's superior experience helped him \Nunderstand what had happened to Youpi.
33942,Insult x And x Payback.,117,We can win.
33943,Insult x And x Payback.,117,That was a powerful blast.
33944,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"I doubt it'll be easy to goad him \Ninto doing that on purpose, and make it out unharmed."
33945,Insult x And x Payback.,117,But the return for taking that risk will be enormous.
33946,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"I make him mad, so he blows up."
33947,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The perfect time to hit him would be when he's charging up.
33948,Insult x And x Payback.,117,And the aura required to fuel his explosion will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.
33949,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The plan Knuckle formed on the spot was almost flawless for dealing \Nwith the berserk Youpi.
33950,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"However, Youpi's true worth only \Nbecame clear after the explosion."
33951,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"As Youpi transitioned between \Nlingering pleasure and despondency, this selfish ability that could be \Ncalled the dregs of his ego was focused solely on how he could use this power for the King's sake."
33952,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Selflessness...
33953,Insult x And x Payback.,117,His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality continued to function calmly even after \Nthe discovery of his burst of emotion.
33954,Insult x And x Payback.,117,My contribution to the King will be how well I can control this ability \Nwithout letting my emotions take over.
33955,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"In other words,"
33956,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I must use it to destroy the intruders.
33957,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Now that Youpi had learned how \Nto be both enraged and composed, the risk for Knuckle was overly great."
33958,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Approximately three minutes have \Npassed since the mission began.
33959,Insult x And x Payback.,117,The intentions of all involved\Nare beginning to come together.
33960,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Next time: A x False x Rage.
33961,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Yeah, screw you!"
33962,Insult x And x Payback.,117,"Sorry, Killua..."
33963,Insult x And x Payback.,117,I won't forgive you.
33964,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Here's a chocolate robot.
33965,Insult x And x Payback.,117,Gon!
33966,A x False x Rage.,118,"Do it, Knuckle!"
33967,A x False x Rage.,118,Damn it!
33968,A x False x Rage.,118,That bastard...
33969,A x False x Rage.,118,He...
33970,A x False x Rage.,118,He... looked at me like I was trash!
33971,A x False x Rage.,118,Give that bastard an extra punch for me...
33972,A x False x Rage.,118,"Yeah, I got it!"
33973,A x False x Rage.,118,"Sorry, master..."
33974,A x False x Rage.,118,We're both fools.
33975,A x False x Rage.,118,There's something more important \Nthan the world right now!
33976,A x False x Rage.,118,A x False x Rage
33977,A x False x Rage.,118,"Though the central tower's third floor escaped destruction, having been \Ncushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail, it had been blown slightly to \Nthe left of its original position, barely keeping the building's appearance intact\Nwhile maintaining a precarious balance."
33978,A x False x Rage.,118,"Nearby, in the middle of the \Ncentral tower's lower portion, which had been reduced to rubble \Nresembling an ancient gladiator arena..."
33979,A x False x Rage.,118,"I am a foolish servant of the King, letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey."
33980,A x False x Rage.,118,That's how I should approach it.
33981,A x False x Rage.,118,That's the impression I should give them.
33982,A x False x Rage.,118,"Where are you hiding, little rats?"
33983,A x False x Rage.,118,"Come out here, so I can squash you!"
33984,A x False x Rage.,118,I know he'll show himself again...
33985,A x False x Rage.,118,To exploit the opening just before I explode.
33986,A x False x Rage.,118,It's time.
33987,A x False x Rage.,118,Adding inte—
33988,A x False x Rage.,118,Shut up!
33989,A x False x Rage.,118,"While Youpi was allowing a \Nfalse rage to consume him, putting on a show of shouting \Nin order to draw out Knuckle..."
33990,A x False x Rage.,118,"No matter what happens outside, \Nmy goal is to pin this guy here."
33991,A x False x Rage.,118,That's all I need to do!
33992,A x False x Rage.,118,"Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms, tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke, maintained just enough distance \Nas to go unnoticed by Morel as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out \Nhis escape from Smoky Jail."
33993,A x False x Rage.,118,Beneath the northern section of the palace
33994,A x False x Rage.,118,Palace
33995,A x False x Rage.,118,"Border Guard Area F was a large area, with warehouses laid \Nout in the shape of a dragonfly."
33996,A x False x Rage.,118,Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A
33997,A x False x Rage.,118,Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E\N\NEmergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C
33998,A x False x Rage.,118,"Area D, located on one of the wing's tips, was where Bizeff had created a private zone with his warehouse for hiding women."
33999,A x False x Rage.,118,"Having learned the warehouse's \Nlocation from Marcos,"
34000,A x False x Rage.,118,"Ikalgo was making his way there by truck via a direct, five-kilometer road."
34001,A x False x Rage.,118,"By the time Ikalgo had reached the crossroads that led to Areas A and B, his Satellite Dragonflies had already \Narrived at the warehouse."
34002,A x False x Rage.,118,The door's open...
34003,A x False x Rage.,118,This is a good sign.
34004,A x False x Rage.,118,Palm put Bizeff to sleep \Nand headed for the palace.
34005,A x False x Rage.,118,"When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock \Nthe door in his rush to follow her."
34006,A x False x Rage.,118,That's the likely explanation.
34007,A x False x Rage.,118,Brovada's in the border guard area?
34008,A x False x Rage.,118,This meant that Ikalgo had no choice but to face Brovada.
34009,A x False x Rage.,118,Brovada doesn't trust me.
34010,A x False x Rage.,118,Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?
34011,A x False x Rage.,118,Stay calm...
34012,A x False x Rage.,118,"Stay calm and figure out what he \Nknows and what he doesn't, in order to stay alive!"
34013,A x False x Rage.,118,What happened during our encounter \Nthat aroused his suspicion?
34014,A x False x Rage.,118,Was there something unnatural \Nabout my imitation of Flutter?
34015,A x False x Rage.,118,I suppose it would be strange for Hagya \Nto order me to go underground.
34016,A x False x Rage.,118,"But since they didn't stop me on the spot, my mistake must not have been fatal."
34017,A x False x Rage.,118,"Rather, something aroused an inkling \Nof doubt in the back of Brovada's mind."
34018,A x False x Rage.,118,And Brovada's down here because he \Nwants to confirm those doubts!
34019,A x False x Rage.,118,Was it small enough that I can explain?
34020,A x False x Rage.,118,Or was it big enough that he \Nonly wants final verification?
34021,A x False x Rage.,118,No room for optimism.
34022,A x False x Rage.,118,I should assume it was a big mistake.
34023,A x False x Rage.,118,Is anyone here?
34024,A x False x Rage.,118,I am a messenger from the secretary!
34025,A x False x Rage.,118,Depending on the response...
34026,A x False x Rage.,118,"No, I have to assume that if he has a chance, he'll attack..."
34027,A x False x Rage.,118,Or he'll kill me!
34028,A x False x Rage.,118,I am a messenger from the secretary!
34029,A x False x Rage.,118,The secretary ordered me to come here!
34030,A x False x Rage.,118,Thinker Bell!
34031,A x False x Rage.,118,"If you're here, you must come with me at once!"
34032,A x False x Rage.,118,Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.
34033,A x False x Rage.,118,This was meant to reassure \NPalm that he was an ally.
34034,A x False x Rage.,118,Why didn't you respond?
34035,A x False x Rage.,118,Where's everyone else?
34036,A x False x Rage.,118,I d-don't know anything about \Nwhat's happening outside...
34037,A x False x Rage.,118,I'm not allowed to talk to anyone \Nother than the secretary.
34038,A x False x Rage.,118,She had assumed that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.
34039,A x False x Rage.,118,The other women thought the same thing.
34040,A x False x Rage.,118,"Each room had a phone exclusively \Nfor communication with Bizeff, so it was illogical for him to send \Na messenger, hence their suspicion."
34041,A x False x Rage.,118,"They believed that a visit from a stranger must be a test to see if they could \Nstay calm and follow orders under unusual circumstances, so they refused to speak to Ikalgo."
34042,A x False x Rage.,118,"However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor."
34043,A x False x Rage.,118,Is this the place?
34044,A x False x Rage.,118,The women had a much higher chance \Nof surviving if they stayed here.
34045,A x False x Rage.,118,"Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about \Nkeeping them alive, much less protecting them."
34046,A x False x Rage.,118,There's writing in {\i0
34047,A x False x Rage.,118,Gyo{\i0
34048,A x False x Rage.,118,It was less likely that Bizeff would find a message that wasn't \Non paper or some other device.
34049,A x False x Rage.,118,"""Heading to the palace."
34050,A x False x Rage.,118,"If I don't make contact before the mission, assume I am dead."""
34051,A x False x Rage.,118,Ikalgo had expected this.
34052,A x False x Rage.,118,But he still felt as much anguish as \Nif he had lost part of his own body.
34053,A x False x Rage.,118,Palm...
34054,A x False x Rage.,118,"If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead, use your Satellite Dragonflies and \Ntelepathy to support the team."
34055,A x False x Rage.,118,Got it.
34056,A x False x Rage.,118,"Pretend that you're reporting \Nto your Squadron Leader, when you're actually reporting to Meleoron."
34057,A x False x Rage.,118,"So you want me to feed the enemy lies, \Nto throw them off?"
34058,A x False x Rage.,118,Yes. It's a crucial task. \NI'm counting on you.
34059,A x False x Rage.,118,"That will only be possible if they don't know Meleoron is here, \Nor that I've switched sides."
34060,A x False x Rage.,118,"Which means that, since he \Nis already suspicious of me,"
34061,A x False x Rage.,118,I must eliminate Brovada!
34062,A x False x Rage.,118,"Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?"
34063,A x False x Rage.,118,Yeah... I did.
34064,A x False x Rage.,118,"Hagya, huh?"
34065,A x False x Rage.,118,Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?
34066,A x False x Rage.,118,"Okay, the fake is dead."
34067,A x False x Rage.,118,Empty?
34068,A x False x Rage.,118,"Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya."
34069,A x False x Rage.,118,The suspect is now dead!
34070,A x False x Rage.,118,"Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,"
34071,A x False x Rage.,118,I can move around freely.
34072,A x False x Rage.,118,"Still, I never heard anything about \NHagya changing his name!"
34073,A x False x Rage.,118,What's he called now?
34074,A x False x Rage.,118,It's true that I really knew \Nnothing of his new name...
34075,A x False x Rage.,118,But will they believe that?
34076,A x False x Rage.,118,I must think of a reason they'll accept \Nif I encounter any of them.
34077,A x False x Rage.,118,"No, that won't work!"
34078,A x False x Rage.,118,Brovada opened fire without warning!
34079,A x False x Rage.,118,That shows they think anyone who doesn't \Nknow Hagya's new name is an enemy.
34080,A x False x Rage.,118,"If they find me, there'll be a battle!"
34081,A x False x Rage.,118,I have to go back up there expecting that!
34082,A x False x Rage.,118,Please enter your code number.
34083,A x False x Rage.,118,The elevator isn't ascending!
34084,A x False x Rage.,118,Don't tell me that he came \Ndown here without knowing about the passcode system.
34085,A x False x Rage.,118,This is my chance!
34086,A x False x Rage.,118,I have two options to pick from!
34087,A x False x Rage.,118,Show yourself!
34088,A x False x Rage.,118,It's nearly been five minutes since \NChapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.
34089,A x False x Rage.,118,Nen{\i1
34090,A x False x Rage.,118,Is that enough to guarantee that he won't \Npay off the full balance with one hit?
34091,A x False x Rage.,118,I just...
34092,A x False x Rage.,118,I just have to avoid a direct hit.
34093,A x False x Rage.,118,"The worst possible scenario \Nwould be that I'm hit by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7 \NBankruptcy, and also deals damage to me."
34094,A x False x Rage.,118,"If that's gonna happen,"
34095,A x False x Rage.,118,"I'm better off buying time, \Nwaiting for him to go bust."
34096,A x False x Rage.,118,But that means I'll have to wait for at least ten minutes.
34097,A x False x Rage.,118,Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!
34098,A x False x Rage.,118,I have to make him explode once more.
34099,A x False x Rage.,118,Or else we'll run out of time!
34100,A x False x Rage.,118,"Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!"
34101,A x False x Rage.,118,"You look happy, monster!"
34102,A x False x Rage.,118,"He fell for my trap, for my false rage."
34103,A x False x Rage.,118,"I've been looking for you, cockroach."
34104,A x False x Rage.,118,Make this damn fly that's \Nfollowing me around shut up!
34105,A x False x Rage.,118,Damn Fly
34106,A x False x Rage.,118,"Every time it squeaks, \NI'm reminded of your annoying face!"
34107,A x False x Rage.,118,"Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time."
34108,A x False x Rage.,118,But I'll be faking it...
34109,A x False x Rage.,118,It's time.
34110,A x False x Rage.,118,Adding interest.
34111,A x False x Rage.,118,Just shut up!
34112,A x False x Rage.,118,"Right before I explode, I pause for a moment."
34113,A x False x Rage.,118,He'll try to attack during that opening.
34114,A x False x Rage.,118,"But if I stay calm when my rage takes over, \NI can control my growth."
34115,A x False x Rage.,118,Get this thing off me right now...
34116,A x False x Rage.,118,Or I'll kill you!
34117,A x False x Rage.,118,"I'll blow every last one of you \Nto smithereens, you scum!"
34118,A x False x Rage.,118,"When he tries to take advantage of \Nthe opening I give him, he'll be open."
34119,A x False x Rage.,118,And I'll take advantage of that.
34120,A x False x Rage.,118,"That won't happen, you giant lump."
34121,A x False x Rage.,118,You're gonna die on your knees right here.
34122,A x False x Rage.,118,The next one...
34123,A x False x Rage.,118,The next tick of the interest will be the gong.
34124,A x False x Rage.,118,I'll show you who the cockroach is here.
34125,A x False x Rage.,118,It's time.
34126,A x False x Rage.,118,Adding interest.
34127,A x False x Rage.,118,This will work.
34128,A x False x Rage.,118,"I have time to land one... No, two hits!"
34129,A x False x Rage.,118,"I have time to punch him in the face, \Nand get out of the way before the explosion!"
34130,A x False x Rage.,118,"Take this, pig!"
34131,A x False x Rage.,118,This one's for Shoot!
34132,A x False x Rage.,118,And the next one's also for Shoot!
34133,A x False x Rage.,118,Is something wrong with me?
34134,A x False x Rage.,118,I was never that close to him...
34135,A x False x Rage.,118,"Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him."
34136,A x False x Rage.,118,"I don't even know when he \Nclimbed to the rank of ""friend""..."
34137,A x False x Rage.,118,So why am I this desperate to avenge him?
34138,A x False x Rage.,118,"It's not even ""vengeance,"" since he's not dead..."
34139,A x False x Rage.,118,"Well, I guess a lot of it is that \Nwe've faced death together..."
34140,A x False x Rage.,118,Anyone who's risked their \Nlife with you is a friend.
34141,A x False x Rage.,118,But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!
34142,A x False x Rage.,118,He ignored someone who entered \Na fight with him expecting to die?
34143,A x False x Rage.,118,Has he no sympathy as a warrior?
34144,A x False x Rage.,118,Damn Ant!
34145,A x False x Rage.,118,I'm getting more and more pissed off!
34146,A x False x Rage.,118,I'll give him a third punch for myself!
34147,A x False x Rage.,118,Wow... I'm amazing myself!
34148,A x False x Rage.,118,I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!
34149,A x False x Rage.,118,And I haven't finished throwing my punch?
34150,A x False x Rage.,118,Wait...
34151,A x False x Rage.,118,Is this what they mean?
34152,A x False x Rage.,118,Time's almost frozen.
34153,A x False x Rage.,118,Everything slows down... right before you die?
34154,A x False x Rage.,118,He stopped the explosion!
34155,A x False x Rage.,118,He got me!
34156,A x False x Rage.,118,He was actually keeping his cool...
34157,A x False x Rage.,118,I can't stop!
34158,A x False x Rage.,118,"Sorry, Shoot..."
34159,A x False x Rage.,118,I screwed up!
34160,A x False x Rage.,118,The interest won't be enough to pay for this.
34161,A x False x Rage.,118,It's over...
34162,A x False x Rage.,118,Shoot...
34163,A x False x Rage.,118,Boss...
34164,A x False x Rage.,118,Everyone...
34165,A x False x Rage.,118,Everything is... up to you.
34166,A x False x Rage.,118,Thunderbolt!
34167,A x False x Rage.,118,Lightning?
34168,A x False x Rage.,118,He's completely paralyzed...
34169,A x False x Rage.,118,This is my chance!
34170,A x False x Rage.,118,"If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!"
34171,A x False x Rage.,118,I did it! I did it! I did it!
34172,A x False x Rage.,118,I'm done! I can't do any more!
34173,A x False x Rage.,118,"Crap, I almost died!"
34174,A x False x Rage.,118,I could see the pearly gates...
34175,A x False x Rage.,118,My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.
34176,A x False x Rage.,118,I hit him eight times!
34177,A x False x Rage.,118,What just happened?
34178,A x False x Rage.,118,I'm sure he fell for my trap.
34179,A x False x Rage.,118,What happened?
34180,A x False x Rage.,118,That's obvious.
34181,A x False x Rage.,118,I didn't notice there was an attack \Ncoming from a different direction...
34182,A x False x Rage.,118,Is that possible?
34183,A x False x Rage.,118,That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive until it was right over me?
34184,A x False x Rage.,118,The same thing happened before.
34185,A x False x Rage.,118,"Before I even realized it, \Nthis little nuisance was on me."
34186,A x False x Rage.,118,There were no signs at all.
34187,A x False x Rage.,118,I saw him back at the staircase...
34188,A x False x Rage.,118,Did he do it?
34189,A x False x Rage.,118,"Sorry, but what's about to happen is just me blowing off some steam."
34190,A x False x Rage.,118,Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.
34191,A x False x Rage.,118,Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?
34192,A x False x Rage.,118,Ika-tta say I'd go with Ikalgo.
34193,A x False x Rage.,118,Ikan agree with that!
34194,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I saw him back at the staircase...
34195,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Did he do it?
34196,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Sorry, but what's about to happen is just me blowing off some steam."
34197,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Strong x Or x Weak
34198,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,He disappeared?
34199,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Godspeed.
34200,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The difference in initial action \Nspeed was so overwhelming that Youpi had no time to \Nmake a sound or transform.
34201,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Killua's Godspeed placed an \Nelectrical burden upon his own body, making it possible for his body to \Nperform at a level far beyond what should have been possible."
34202,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Killua had divided this power \Ninto two different abilities:
34203,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Speed of Lightning, which allowed \Nhim to control his body at will,"
34204,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Speed of Lightning and Whirlwind, which allowed his body \Nto react automatically to his opponent."
34205,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Whirlwind
34206,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"In a previous fight, he'd used the \Nlatter to stop his opponent's dart."
34207,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response to vibrations in aura that \Nindicate the opponent's hostility.
34208,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"The attack bypasses commands from his brain, unleashing attacks that transcend his \Nown limits by relying on reflexes alone, allowing him to easily surpass \Nhis opponent's physical speed."
34209,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,What's going on here?
34210,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,All of these guys have less than \Nten percent of my raw power.
34211,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This makes no sense...
34212,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I can't do a thing against him.
34213,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Whirlwind!
34214,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Profound...
34215,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"This ""aura"" stuff is intense..."
34216,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This is getting interesting.
34217,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Before my explosion, I never would \Nhave enjoyed fighting an uphill battle."
34218,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Youpi's change in heart would lead him \Nto make an unbelievable choice, but this would not happen until later."
34219,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Crap!
34220,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I used it all up!
34221,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Hold it!
34222,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You're not getting away!
34223,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You're seeing this through with me...
34224,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Until you die!
34225,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,He disappeared?
34226,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Again.
34227,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"He vanished, as though he were \Nnever here to begin with."
34228,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's it...
34229,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,At least one of them must have the ability to make people appear and disappear at will.
34230,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Huh?
34231,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Please enter your passcode.
34232,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Damn, I didn't get a code."
34233,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Your passcode and name do not match.
34234,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Please reenter your passcode.
34235,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,A second input error will result in your restraint.
34236,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,He came down here without a passcode?
34237,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.
34238,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The door has been locked.
34239,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Please enter your passcode.
34240,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This is my chance!
34241,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have two options.
34242,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The elevator will fill with \Nsleeping gas eventually.
34243,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Once he's asleep, I have to decide."
34244,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,"
34245,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Monitor Room and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.
34246,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"This way, when he wakes up, \Nhe'll still be stuck in the elevator."
34247,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,But there's a high risk that someone above \Nwill notice that the elevator isn't coming up.
34248,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Two, I move Brovada somewhere \Nelse while he's asleep."
34249,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,There are plenty of trucks parked around.
34250,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,And the warehouse doors require a \Npasscode to open from the inside.
34251,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"When he wakes up, Brovada won't \Nbe able to open them."
34252,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"And if I use the cargo entrance \Nto return to the surface, the risk that I'll encounter enemies will \Nbe much lower than if I take the elevator."
34253,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,No! That won't work!
34254,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!
34255,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's the safest option!
34256,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse, \Nand use it to take out other Squadron Leaders."
34257,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's the least it'll take!
34258,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'll stick the barrel of my gun through \Nthe gap in his armor and open fire.
34259,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies, but he had never killed anyone \Nwith his own hands before."
34260,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Enter your passcode at once.
34261,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If a passcode is not entered \Nwithin thirty seconds, the restraining process will begin."
34262,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The monitor room in the border guard area...
34263,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"There should be a monitor \Nfor the elevator camera, and a button to open the doors!"
34264,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Well, I'm outside now, but I had to destroy the elevator..."
34265,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Is there another exit?
34266,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I was naïve...
34267,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I didn't expect him to shoot the door.
34268,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,What now?
34269,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Do I wait for him to lower his guard, \Nthen sneak out the cargo entrance?"
34270,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Or do I wait for him to leave?
34271,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Either way, if he goes back to the surface..."
34272,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's not good enough!
34273,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm being naïve!
34274,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If he returns to the surface, and tells the others that Flutter's dead,"
34275,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'll be able to move around freely!
34276,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Am I an idiot?
34277,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If I allow an enemy to return to the surface, \NI'm putting everyone else in more danger."
34278,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This one's tough.
34279,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I can't let him go back up...
34280,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!"
34281,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Yes, this way!"
34282,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm gonna trap you.
34283,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,A little farther...
34284,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Wait until he's a little farther from it...
34285,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Now!
34286,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,So there was someone besides Flutter...
34287,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...
34288,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Too bad for you.
34289,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If only one path remains, it's too good \Nto be true. Anyone would be suspicious."
34290,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Well, now I know about you."
34291,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"And I bet you're hiding in the \Nmonitor room to watch me, chicken!"
34292,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Damn...
34293,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I could have completely \Ntrapped him in that hallway...
34294,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,But there's no way out from where he is now.
34295,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,He's still trapped.
34296,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Sleeping gas will eventually \Nfill the room, and he'll..."
34297,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Crap! He isn't trapped!
34298,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,There's a way out!
34299,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I should get out of here...
34300,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's probably sleeping gas.
34301,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have to do something before he realizes.
34302,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I know...
34303,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The armored vehicles in the garage.
34304,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"With those, I could at least lock him in."
34305,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"But then I'll have no way to get \Nback to the surface, either!"
34306,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Think...
34307,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Is there anything I can use here?
34308,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Come up with the best possible plan, fast!"
34309,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I guess I have to blow through this shutter...
34310,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,How annoying!
34311,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have to do this!
34312,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Damn! All that firing, and I \Nbarely scorched the surface?"
34313,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Guess I'll need to think of something else...
34314,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I know!
34315,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"You can operate the shutters \Nfrom the monitor room,"
34316,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Monitor Room so I can go there to open the shutters.
34317,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Nice idea!
34318,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Wait,"
34319,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have to go through the shutters \Nto reach the monitor room.
34320,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Damn, so I have to get through these \Nshutters to return to the surface?"
34321,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Wait...
34322,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,There might be a way to escape without busting down the shutters.
34323,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The shutter's opening?
34324,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,An armored vehicle?
34325,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's something a chicken would use.
34326,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,But the shutter behind it is still shut.
34327,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.
34328,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Which means that...
34329,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"First, he closed the front shutter and \Nparked the vehicle there."
34330,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Then he returned to the monitor room, and started raising the front shutter and lowering the back one, \Nbefore racing back to the vehicle?"
34331,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?
34332,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"He closed off his only escape \Nroute, just to finish me off?"
34333,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Heh... Yeah, right."
34334,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,So there's more than one...
34335,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The other's watching in the monitor room.
34336,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Pisses me off!
34337,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Watch this, you peeping tom..."
34338,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm gonna drag your buddy \Nout of the armored vehicle and rip him to shreds!
34339,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm the only one here.
34340,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I have to do something...
34341,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,By myself!
34342,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,That's tough armor!
34343,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I did it!
34344,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Crap! He blocked the elevator!
34345,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"I could have blown a hole in the \Nceiling, and climbed up the wire!"
34346,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I've blocked his escape route.
34347,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,First hurdle cleared!
34348,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You have guts to show yourself...
34349,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!
34350,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Smoke?
34351,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Did he kill himself?
34352,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Miss his chance to escape?
34353,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Either way, there's no way to move this thing!"
34354,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,There's only a few centimeters of space.
34355,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,The elevator's completely blocked!
34356,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!
34357,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!"
34358,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Open the damned shutter!
34359,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You hear me?
34360,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Being an octopus, I only need a few \Ncentimeters to squeeze through."
34361,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Second hurdle cleared.
34362,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Hey!
34363,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Open the shutter!
34364,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Now, I just have to wait for the \Nsleeping gas to fill the room."
34365,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"I can hold my breath, but I don't want to waste time."
34366,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Wait for the right timing!
34367,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Third hurdle cleared.
34368,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Be patient.
34369,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Nice and slow.
34370,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This is the final hurdle.
34371,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done."
34372,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Fire! This is the best option!
34373,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'll be safest if I control his body \Nand return to the surface!
34374,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Which means I have to kill him...
34375,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm the only one here.
34376,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,There's no one else to help me!
34377,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I h-have to... kill him!
34378,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I can't do it!
34379,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm...
34380,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,I'm... just a coward!
34381,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...
34382,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Within the shifted central tower, \Nas Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon, he was battling doubts of his own, as well."
34383,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Hold on.
34384,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,What if...
34385,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Pitou! Pouf!
34386,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Are you there?
34387,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Hey!
34388,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"What if it isn't that he chose \Nnot to respond to Youpi, but that he wasn't able to respond?"
34389,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Within the cocoon should be\Nnothing but a goopy mess.
34390,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.
34391,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"If he's utterly defenseless \Nwhile he changes forms, this is the time to attack."
34392,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Would he really make such a literally \Nfatal mistake in this situation?
34393,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,It's not possible!
34394,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.
34395,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"But the question is whether the \Ntrap activates when I attack, or if it's already been activated, \Nbefore I've even attacked."
34396,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Which is it?
34397,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You have doubts because you \Nare good at what you do.
34398,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"However, that is all there is to it."
34399,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Attack? Don't attack?
34400,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,What do I do?
34401,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Next time: Fake x And x Real.
34402,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,"Hey... If not now, when?"
34403,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,Not yet!
34404,Strong x Or x Weak.,119,You're a fake. You aren't Killua.
34405,Fake x And x Real.,120,No way...
34406,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Where did he go, in that condition?!"
34407,Fake x And x Real.,120,Shoot...
34408,Fake x And x Real.,120,Fake X And X Real
34409,Fake x And x Real.,120,You intend to fight?
34410,Fake x And x Real.,120,"You will abandon your original plan, and \Ncommit yourself to a baseless assumption?"
34411,Fake x And x Real.,120,You really believe...
34412,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Smoky Jail, undo!"
34413,Fake x And x Real.,120,I see you've made your decision.
34414,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Once I stopped to think about it, \Nit was pretty simple."
34415,Fake x And x Real.,120,You used your cocoon after I played my card.
34416,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Since you went into hiding \Nonly after learning my agenda,"
34417,Fake x And x Real.,120,"I knew that was your ability, and that it was a trap."
34418,Fake x And x Real.,120,Your lack of reaction when I lifted \Nmy pipe to strike confirmed it.
34419,Fake x And x Real.,120,It made no sense that you showed \Nno sign of reacting at all.
34420,Fake x And x Real.,120,Fifteen minutes.
34421,Fake x And x Real.,120,That was how long I expected you to take before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.
34422,Fake x And x Real.,120,"During that time, I intended to slip \Nthrough the smoke and move freely."
34423,Fake x And x Real.,120,"You trapped me within that barrier \Nto separate me from the King, yes?"
34424,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Meaning, as long as your \Nprison of smoke was there, your allies would see it and \Nconclude that I was still inside."
34425,Fake x And x Real.,120,"I decided to take advantage of that misconception, and \Nquietly dispose of your friends."
34426,Fake x And x Real.,120,I knew you would hesitate long enough \Nto give me plenty of time to act.
34427,Fake x And x Real.,120,You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes \Nwaiting in front of an empty cocoon?
34428,Fake x And x Real.,120,You really underestimated me.
34429,Fake x And x Real.,120,"No, on the contrary, it appears..."
34430,Fake x And x Real.,120,I overestimated you!
34431,Fake x And x Real.,120,He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?
34432,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail, \NI wouldn't have seen a thing!"
34433,Fake x And x Real.,120,You should have waited longer...
34434,Fake x And x Real.,120,Because my strategy was a last resort.
34435,Fake x And x Real.,120,"To be honest, I was upset by the \Nfact that I'd been trapped."
34436,Fake x And x Real.,120,Not a very good diversion strategy.
34437,Fake x And x Real.,120,You just contradicted yourself.
34438,Fake x And x Real.,120,You made it through the smoke just fine!
34439,Fake x And x Real.,120,"At that point, that was all there was to it."
34440,Fake x And x Real.,120,I was under the impression that \Nyou were a more capable soldier...
34441,Fake x And x Real.,120,One who would carry out his original \Nplan and be faithful to his mission.
34442,Fake x And x Real.,120,"However, you made some wild guesses \Nand removed the barrier."
34443,Fake x And x Real.,120,I must thank you.
34444,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you.
34445,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you. Thank you.
34446,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you. Thank you.
34447,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you.
34448,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you. Thank you.
34449,Fake x And x Real.,120,Deep Purple!
34450,Fake x And x Real.,120,Run!
34451,Fake x And x Real.,120,I can't destroy them?
34452,Fake x And x Real.,120,They just break up and reform?
34453,Fake x And x Real.,120,He's invincible?
34454,Fake x And x Real.,120,Thank you! Bye-bye!
34455,Fake x And x Real.,120,Don't be fooled...
34456,Fake x And x Real.,120,He's playing mind games!
34457,Fake x And x Real.,120,My decision to attack the \Ncocoon was the best option.
34458,Fake x And x Real.,120,"No, the moment I second-guess myself, \NI've played into his hands."
34459,Fake x And x Real.,120,"My next job is to predict his objective, and stop him..."
34460,Fake x And x Real.,120,"To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard, to find and eliminate my companions, and to reunite with the King!"
34461,Fake x And x Real.,120,That must be it...
34462,Fake x And x Real.,120,His interests are consistent with mine.
34463,Fake x And x Real.,120,There's no problem!
34464,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll take this!
34465,Fake x And x Real.,120,He's fast!
34466,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!
34467,Fake x And x Real.,120,He got me...
34468,Fake x And x Real.,120,I can't use any other abilities.
34469,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If Deep Purple is undone, \NI'll be completely helpless!"
34470,Fake x And x Real.,120,"I'll have to find a way to get by, \Nusing Deep Purple alone."
34471,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Yo, are you the esper?"
34472,Fake x And x Real.,120,"What'd you do with Shoot, huh?"
34473,Fake x And x Real.,120,What?
34474,Fake x And x Real.,120,Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...
34475,Fake x And x Real.,120,The maximum number I could \Nproduce in my current state.
34476,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.
34477,Fake x And x Real.,120,I see what you're doing...
34478,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll let you hit me once.
34479,Fake x And x Real.,120,But in return...
34480,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll take your life!
34481,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Okay, no one's here."
34482,Fake x And x Real.,120,This is our chance to escape.
34483,Fake x And x Real.,120,Let's go.
34484,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Man, they said we'd be safe here."
34485,Fake x And x Real.,120,I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.
34486,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Since my stomach shrunk, that probably \Nmeans Cheetu-sama's dead..."
34487,Fake x And x Real.,120,"And I haven't heard anything from \NFlutter, so I guess that's it."
34488,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll leave to become a Queen!
34489,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll make you my second-in-command.
34490,Fake x And x Real.,120,How's that?
34491,Fake x And x Real.,120,Help...
34492,Fake x And x Real.,120,Please... get me out of here...
34493,Fake x And x Real.,120,Help!
34494,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Oh, Secretary Bizeff..."
34495,Fake x And x Real.,120,You're in trouble.
34496,Fake x And x Real.,120,I can't move my legs...
34497,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Whatever, let's go."
34498,Fake x And x Real.,120,This looks dangerous.
34499,Fake x And x Real.,120,What? Wait... Please!
34500,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm going to die!
34501,Fake x And x Real.,120,No can do... I can't move all that.
34502,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Then, could you call for help?"
34503,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Like, seriously..."
34504,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!
34505,Fake x And x Real.,120,"The boss is missing, our link \Nwith the King is gone, and the palace is a mess."
34506,Fake x And x Real.,120,I have no reason to stay here!
34507,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll give you whatever reward you want!
34508,Fake x And x Real.,120,There are mountains of treasure underground!
34509,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If you help me, I'll give you anything you want."
34510,Fake x And x Real.,120,So please pull me out!
34511,Fake x And x Real.,120,Where underground?
34512,Fake x And x Real.,120,There's an area for the Supreme \NLeader beyond the shelter.
34513,Fake x And x Real.,120,I've been managing the treasure inside.
34514,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm the only one with access...
34515,Fake x And x Real.,120,You'll give me anything I want?
34516,Fake x And x Real.,120,You'd better keep your promise.
34517,Fake x And x Real.,120,Or I'll kill you!
34518,Fake x And x Real.,120,Treasure! Treasure!
34519,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Treasure, treasure, treasure!"
34520,Fake x And x Real.,120,It's over...
34521,Fake x And x Real.,120,This nation is finished.
34522,Fake x And x Real.,120,That was clearly proven when the air assault began before \NI was able to make any arrangements.
34523,Fake x And x Real.,120,"They're probably calling the Ants biological \Nweapons, to use them as an excuse..."
34524,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If I'm captured by the Federation, they'll force me to confess for a cover \Nstory and throw me in prison for life, or they'll execute me, so I can't talk."
34525,Fake x And x Real.,120,I won't let them capture me...
34526,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm going to escape!
34527,Fake x And x Real.,120,The smoke-user is now out of action.
34528,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Now, I'll go back to the palace, evaluate the current situation, \Nand return to the King."
34529,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him, \Nthe King will only find me a nuisance."
34530,Fake x And x Real.,120,Beelzebub!
34531,Fake x And x Real.,120,Lord of the Flies\NBeelzebub
34532,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Go forth, my clones..."
34533,Fake x And x Real.,120,Identify the location and status of \Nevery person inside the palace!
34534,Fake x And x Real.,120,Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him to disassemble into copies of himself \Nas small as one billionth his size.
34535,Fake x And x Real.,120,"He was able to control the size \Nand number of copies produced, and the smaller the copies, \Nthe more he could produce."
34536,Fake x And x Real.,120,"However, his main body, which served as a control center, \Ncould only be reduced to a bee's size."
34537,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier, my main body could not have escaped."
34538,Fake x And x Real.,120,My combat capacity would \Nhave been reduced by half.
34539,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself must know the incomparable difference in \Nstrength between a clone and your own body.
34540,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Now that my main body is free, \NI have no weaknesses."
34541,Fake x And x Real.,120,You have lost.
34542,Fake x And x Real.,120,You should have been more careful.
34543,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If you had, then when you realized the cocoon was empty, \Nyou should have wondered whether what had been inside it \Nhad actually escaped the barrier."
34544,Fake x And x Real.,120,"And if I had spoken to you \Nfrom outside the barrier, you should have wondered whether \Nthat was my real self."
34545,Fake x And x Real.,120,The plan I executed was an act of desperation.
34546,Fake x And x Real.,120,"I could attempt to confuse your allies, \Nbut my clones are mere husks."
34547,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Assuming that your allies were as strong as you, even if it took a few casualties, \Nthey would have noticed that my clones were fakes!"
34548,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Had you comprehended the truth, \Nand realized that my main body remained within the barrier, you would have understood my \Nability, and searched for me."
34549,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If you had done so,"
34550,Fake x And x Real.,120,I would have had no way to \Nfight you in my reduced state...
34551,Fake x And x Real.,120,"In other words, if you had maintained \Nthe barrier as per your original goal, your allies may have suffered a bit, but you would have been able to defeat me."
34552,Fake x And x Real.,120,And I was ten-percent resolved \Nto accept that fate.
34553,Fake x And x Real.,120,Your emotions were perfectly \Naligned to accomplish that.
34554,Fake x And x Real.,120,I suppose the explosion \Nmust have thrown you off.
34555,Fake x And x Real.,120,A pity...
34556,Fake x And x Real.,120,"However, I am now free."
34557,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!"
34558,Fake x And x Real.,120,"From the start of the mission, \NMorel's condition was less than optimal."
34559,Fake x And x Real.,120,"His exhaustion and impatience, combined \Nwith the extreme tension of the situation, clearly led him to the hasty decision \Nto engage Pouf in a battle of nerves."
34560,Fake x And x Real.,120,"However, he arrived at the \Nperfect time to support Knuckle, keeping him from engaging Youpi alone."
34561,Fake x And x Real.,120,"As a result, it could be said that \Nhe made the correct decision to remove Smoky Jail at that time."
34562,Fake x And x Real.,120,And it was more than simply \Na product of coincidence.
34563,Fake x And x Real.,120,It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of \Nexperience played a role in saving him.
34564,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Upon entering the palace,"
34565,Fake x And x Real.,120,Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies against that of his allies.
34566,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Subconsciously, he knew that they \Nhad underestimated the enemy."
34567,Fake x And x Real.,120,"When he realized the length of time his allies \Ncould hold out was shorter than anticipated, he was led to attack the cocoon in order \Nto avoid struggling with the pros and cons of removing Smoky Jail to go help them."
34568,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge \Nof the battlefield, saved his comrades."
34569,Fake x And x Real.,120,"The real one's hidden among the fakes, \Ntrying to attack me, right?"
34570,Fake x And x Real.,120,"This time, I'll land a counter on you!"
34571,Fake x And x Real.,120,Five were taken out...
34572,Fake x And x Real.,120,I have eighty-four left!
34573,Fake x And x Real.,120,The smoke ones are fake.
34574,Fake x And x Real.,120,They feel completely different.
34575,Fake x And x Real.,120,"When the real one lands a hit, I'll know."
34576,Fake x And x Real.,120,That's when you'll be finished!
34577,Fake x And x Real.,120,Seventy-five left!
34578,Fake x And x Real.,120,Seventy-two...
34579,Fake x And x Real.,120,Seventy...
34580,Fake x And x Real.,120,Pitou and the woman are on the \Nwest tower's second floor.
34581,Fake x And x Real.,120,Pitou appears to be healing the woman.
34582,Fake x And x Real.,120,"A boy, who appears to be an \Nenemy, is sitting nearby."
34583,Fake x And x Real.,120,Three near the entrance to \Nthe underground shelter...
34584,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!"
34585,Fake x And x Real.,120,They may be heading underground.
34586,Fake x And x Real.,120,Welfin is behind them.
34587,Fake x And x Real.,120,He appears to be following them.
34588,Fake x And x Real.,120,The woman was injured by the dragon spears.
34589,Fake x And x Real.,120,But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?
34590,Fake x And x Real.,120,Could he be acquainted with the woman?
34591,Fake x And x Real.,120,"One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower..."
34592,Fake x And x Real.,120,The human captured a few days ago.
34593,Fake x And x Real.,120,It will be born soon.
34594,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Oh, this area's crazy..."
34595,Fake x And x Real.,120,There are lots of enemies.
34596,Fake x And x Real.,120,"One, two, three..."
34597,Fake x And x Real.,120,But Youpi is taking them out quickly.
34598,Fake x And x Real.,120,Youpi and approximately fifty enemies \Nare in the north area of the palace!
34599,Fake x And x Real.,120,It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.
34600,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!"
34601,Fake x And x Real.,120,Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.
34602,Fake x And x Real.,120,Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?
34603,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Only one of the thugs is real, \Nwhile the rest are made of smoke."
34604,Fake x And x Real.,120,The number of puppets is not increasing because he needs the pipe to make more.
34605,Fake x And x Real.,120,It'll take Youpi less than a minute \Nto find the real one.
34606,Fake x And x Real.,120,The King is gone! Where is he?
34607,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Everyone, return!"
34608,Fake x And x Real.,120,What's wrong?
34609,Fake x And x Real.,120,You're running out of clones.
34610,Fake x And x Real.,120,My attacks are too fast for you to get close.
34611,Fake x And x Real.,120,Should I leave an opening for \Nhim to come in and attack?
34612,Fake x And x Real.,120,Carefully...
34613,Fake x And x Real.,120,Act natural.
34614,Fake x And x Real.,120,Here you go...
34615,Fake x And x Real.,120,Come on!
34616,Fake x And x Real.,120,He's a fake?
34617,Fake x And x Real.,120,Wait...
34618,Fake x And x Real.,120,"You finally figured it out, idiot?"
34619,Fake x And x Real.,120,There never was a real one.
34620,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'll kill you!
34621,Fake x And x Real.,120, is{\i0
34622,Fake x And x Real.,120,No kidding!
34623,Fake x And x Real.,120,An aura explosion?
34624,Fake x And x Real.,120,From Youpi?
34625,Fake x And x Real.,120,Did he really need to use such an ability?
34626,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm worried...
34627,Fake x And x Real.,120,But locating the King is my first priority!
34628,Fake x And x Real.,120,"You saved me, boss!"
34629,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If you hadn't set that restriction,"
34630,Fake x And x Real.,120,I would have snapped and rushed him!
34631,Fake x And x Real.,120,Listen to me...
34632,Fake x And x Real.,120,I will create only angry clones of you when you've lost control of your temper.
34633,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If that happens, you are to join the clones, and give careful thought to what must be done."
34634,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
34635,Fake x And x Real.,120,I got it.
34636,Fake x And x Real.,120,"After cooling down and thinking about it,"
34637,Fake x And x Real.,120,I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.
34638,Fake x And x Real.,120,"But if Shoot couldn't move on his own, \Nwho would have moved him?"
34639,Fake x And x Real.,120,Damn... Stop thinking about it!
34640,Fake x And x Real.,120,I need to focus on the opponent before me!
34641,Fake x And x Real.,120,Where... am I?
34642,Fake x And x Real.,120,That's...
34643,Fake x And x Real.,120,Uh-oh!
34644,Fake x And x Real.,120,Hurry up!
34645,Fake x And x Real.,120,Go in before the entrance is blocked!
34646,Fake x And x Real.,120,"Damn, Bizeff is my prey!"
34647,Fake x And x Real.,120,"If I knew what powers they had, \NI could make a move."
34648,Fake x And x Real.,120,Don't come any closer...
34649,Fake x And x Real.,120,Pouf!
34650,Fake x And x Real.,120,Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity.
34651,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm Gon.
34652,Fake x And x Real.,120,And that's all there is to it.
34653,Fake x And x Real.,120,I'm Killua!
34654,Fake x And x Real.,120,And that's all there is to it.
34655,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Don't come any closer...
34656,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Pouf!
34657,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Defeat x And x Dignity
34658,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Why?
34659,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Had you remained silent, \NI could have killed him."
34660,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Why are you so needlessly frightened?
34661,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He noticed you.
34662,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If you'd approached him with the intent to kill, he would have immediately attacked Komugi."
34663,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,That was a risk I didn't want to take.
34664,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Your words baffle me.
34665,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Isn't he sitting there because \Nhe wants to help that girl?
34666,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You almost make it sound like \Nhe means to harm her.
34667,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Why?
34668,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's none of your business.
34669,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Shut up.
34670,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon."
34671,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You go find Knuckle.
34672,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Pouf is outside the barrier, so it's very likely the big guy was taken out."
34673,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Review the situation, then you and Knuckle decide what \Nto do, and whether to retreat."
34674,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Wh-What about you guys?
34675,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge."
34676,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's."
34677,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'm kidding!
34678,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It'll be fine.
34679,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"I've always got the magic word, ""Kite""!"
34680,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I have it under control.
34681,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Really?
34682,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Then why did you look so sad back there?
34683,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"You're sure, then?"
34684,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway."
34685,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!"
34686,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's none of your business.
34687,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Shut up.
34688,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Shut up?
34689,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Downwind, huh?"
34690,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Am I interrupting something?
34691,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then."
34692,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Don't move.
34693,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Stay right there.
34694,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"You can use your wing scales to control others, right?"
34695,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Don't take a single step.
34696,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Pouf, please!"
34697,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Are you insane?
34698,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You want me to stand here and do nothing?
34699,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,For that woman's sake?
34700,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,For the King's sake!
34701,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Do as he says...
34702,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,What happened?
34703,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Your expression has changed...
34704,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,What happened while I was trapped?
34705,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I promise that I shall not move from this spot.
34706,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"In return, I want you to tell me everything that has happened thus far."
34707,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If I ask where the King is, he'll \Nget suspicious and silence us."
34708,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.
34709,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Be careful to make it sound quite natural.
34710,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If you fail, we will see bloodshed."
34711,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,That's all there is to it.
34712,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's time.
34713,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Adding interest.
34714,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I've got it...
34715,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I could feel myself controlling the explosion.
34716,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered."
34717,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I need rage...
34718,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I must build up my rage before \NI forget how it felt!
34719,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,That's the second time you've \Nmade a fool out of me!
34720,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Scum! Trash!
34721,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Piece of crap!
34722,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Stay calm, and let rage consume me..."
34723,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Create and destroy at the same time.
34724,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Manifested through this body!
34725,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Youpi had yet to notice why two conflicting emotions \Ncould exist simultaneously...
34726,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Or what his current predicament was.
34727,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Rage...
34728,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Rage is not intended to be scattered.
34729,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's meant to be focused on a target!
34730,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I Will Destroy You!!!
34731,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I will destroy you!
34732,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Okay! Okay!
34733,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"It's a fake, okay!"
34734,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Keep it up...
34735,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Make me madder!
34736,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Come on!
34737,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's time.
34738,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Adding interest.
34739,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,APR's interest is calculated assuming that aura consumption will \Ncontinue to rise at the current rate.
34740,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Even if Youpi were to reduce his \Naura usage to a bare minimum, in another three minutes and fifty seconds,"
34741,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Nen{\i0
34742,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Ten left.
34743,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,My back's against the wall...
34744,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Looks like he's saving me for last.
34745,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!"
34746,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Morel had deployed all of his puppets \Nclose enough for Youpi to see so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements, but also because he no longer had the \Nstrength to move his puppets around."
34747,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If he lost his focus, the puppets would \Nreturn to smoke and dissipate."
34748,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It shouldn't be much longer...
34749,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He has to run out of{\i0
34750,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,But...
34751,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,But damn...
34752,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,My body and soul... refuse to move.
34753,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"At this point, Morel could not \Neven will himself to stand."
34754,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He had literally reached his limit \Neven before Youpi went bankrupt.
34755,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Zero left...
34756,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I have something to say to you.
34757,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Now that Youpi had learned how to store his rage elsewhere, \Nhis head was much clearer."
34758,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You look like a little fly that's about to die.
34759,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,And yet...
34760,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,That's what makes you guys amazing.
34761,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"During the battle, Youpi had \Nevolved at an alarming rate, increasing the gap between \Nthe Hunters and himself."
34762,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.
34763,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi, this must have been the last thing he \Nexpected Youpi to say in this situation."
34764,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,But Morel could honestly accept \Nthat this was Youpi's true nature.
34765,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'm not sure how to say this...
34766,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"But because you've impressed me,"
34767,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I have to be sure to kill you.
34768,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"It's only proper, I guess?"
34769,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,This is game over.
34770,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Well, I'll end this with one blow."
34771,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Don't move.
34772,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I don't think I even mind letting him kill me now.
34773,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Bye.
34774,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He disappeared?
34775,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,There's blood...
34776,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,What's going on?
34777,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It wasn't teleportation?
34778,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"The moment I was about to cut through him, he disappeared."
34779,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I thought that one of them had the \Nability to use teleportation...
34780,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"But when he disappeared, \NI didn't see anyone else."
34781,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"And I struck before he disappeared, so if \Nhe teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood."
34782,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,But I was able to cut him.
34783,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Yet I can no longer see him.
34784,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Does that mean he only turned invisible?
34785,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,An ability to become transparent?
34786,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If he had that ability, \Nhe would have used it sooner."
34787,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Which means one of the others must be able to make himself \Nand the rest invisible.
34788,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"And right before I connected, he tried \Nto save the guy with the sunglasses."
34789,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,But I left a deep wound.
34790,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Here he comes!
34791,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,The blood...
34792,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Youpi can follow the blood!
34793,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"We may be invisible, but the \Nblood is leaving a trail."
34794,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If he swings that blade again, \NI'll have to get away by myself."
34795,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'm running out of breath...
34796,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Damn it!
34797,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knuckle?!
34798,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Why did you reveal yourself?
34799,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Right now, your job is to stay \Nhidden as long as possible!"
34800,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'm done running and hiding.
34801,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'll face you.
34802,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,So...
34803,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Let them escape.
34804,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists because Youpi's words had \Nstruck a chord with him.
34805,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You're crazy.
34806,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You can't even call that a trade-off.
34807,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,My answer is no.
34808,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,However...
34809,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If you get rid of this thing, \Nmy answer might change."
34810,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'm sure this has to do with why you've \Nbeen constantly on the run.
34811,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Removing it will make the \Nexchange more even.
34812,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,No... Don't do it!
34813,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!"
34814,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Morel's desperate cry did not reach \NKnuckle due to God's Accomplice.
34815,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"However, it did return Meleoron to his senses."
34816,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Leave me here...
34817,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You can't!
34818,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"You can't do that, Knuckle!"
34819,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Don't worry about me...
34820,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Will you waste everything we've done?
34821,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Everything that Morel, and Shoot... and you... have done by risking your lives!"
34822,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If Knuckle didn't act, the two of \Nthem could still fight together."
34823,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden."
34824,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"With that in mind, the decision that \NMeleoron made after leaving Morel..."
34825,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knuckle!
34826,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knuckle!
34827,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,...ended up backfiring.
34828,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Impossible...
34829,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,We no longer have a way... to defeat Youpi...
34830,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Why...
34831,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded \NKnuckle of Shoot, and broken him."
34832,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Okay... I took away APR!
34833,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Now the terms are even.
34834,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Leave the boss alone!
34835,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Fight me!
34836,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Kill me!
34837,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,No way.
34838,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Hold on!
34839,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Where are you going?!
34840,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"To the King, obviously."
34841,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Do you want to come with me?
34842,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I doubt you could handle it.
34843,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"His ability isn't teleportation, is it?"
34844,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Then you'll have to carry the \Nguy in sunglasses to a doctor, or you struck this deal for nothing."
34845,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If protecting the King was his first priority, he should have killed all three on the spot."
34846,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,It's no big deal...
34847,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"You weaklings can attack me all you \Nwant, but I'll still shake you off."
34848,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"The fact that he was aware of this, \Nbut didn't carry it out, irritated Youpi on a level that didn't \Ncompare to his previous rage."
34849,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Come for me whenever you want.
34850,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'll fight you as equals.
34851,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I don't need to kill you right now...
34852,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,And that's all there is to it!
34853,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit."
34854,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Nen{\i0
34855,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,That also altered what little \Nsense of self he'd had before.
34856,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Having learned to quarantine \Nhis rage and stay calm,"
34857,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Youpi had lost his ability to \Nsee things in simple terms.
34858,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"They're responsible for the rage I've built up, so why don't I feel like using it on them?"
34859,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"What, or who, am I supposed \Nto unleash this rage upon?"
34860,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Was this a sign of maturation?
34861,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Youpi wasn't sure.
34862,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"However, as for Knuckle..."
34863,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I completely lost...
34864,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knuckle!
34865,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,We gotta help the big guy!
34866,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Come on, boss."
34867,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I told you to leave me here...
34868,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Go!
34869,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,The two of you... can still fight.
34870,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Do what you can.
34871,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He said to go whenever you want.
34872,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,So go now!
34873,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I can't.
34874,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I can no longer think of him... as a target to destroy.
34875,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Wait...
34876,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He acknowledged our efforts.
34877,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,He wasn't a bad guy.
34878,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"In that case, I no longer have... any reason to defeat him."
34879,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,The King...
34880,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Knov-san!
34881,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,The soldiers are not important.
34882,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If the King waves his baton, the soldiers \Nwill become demons if necessary."
34883,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I'll take care of Morel...
34884,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Shoot is also okay.
34885,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Are you guys also coming?
34886,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Wait, let me sock this baby hard."
34887,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I received a message from \Nthe chairman's messenger.
34888,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"As planned, he was able to take the \NKing to the appointed location."
34889,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"If they leave now, the Royal \NGuard won't make it in time."
34890,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Their job is done, and so is ours."
34891,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Where's Palm?
34892,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,We don't know yet.
34893,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Okay...
34894,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,What will you do?
34895,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I don't know if I'll be back again.
34896,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You can see how bad I look...
34897,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Are you going or staying?
34898,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,We're staying.
34899,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,We still have a job to do.
34900,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,I see.
34901,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,You're strong...
34902,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Let's go.
34903,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,To look for Palm?
34904,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"No, we can do that later."
34905,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,There's something else we have to do.
34906,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!
34907,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Next time: Pose x And x Name.
34908,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,"Hey, Killua... Say my name."
34909,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Huh? Why now?
34910,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Just do it!
34911,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Gon.
34912,Defeat x and x Dignity.,121,Killua.
34913,Pose x And x Name.,122,I can no longer think of him... as a target to destroy.
34914,Pose x And x Name.,122,He acknowledged our efforts.
34915,Pose x And x Name.,122,He wasn't a bad guy.
34916,Pose x And x Name.,122,"In that case, I no longer have... any reason to defeat him."
34917,Pose x And x Name.,122,The King...
34918,Pose x And x Name.,122,The soldiers are not important.
34919,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If the King waves his baton, the soldiers \Nwill become demons if necessary."
34920,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pose x And x Name
34921,Pose x And x Name.,122,This is an area used for testing weapons of war.
34922,Pose x And x Name.,122,We won't need to restrain ourselves.
34923,Pose x And x Name.,122,Why do you fight?
34924,Pose x And x Name.,122,You have no chance of defeating me.
34925,Pose x And x Name.,122,Why rush to your death?
34926,Pose x And x Name.,122,You presume to know I cannot win?
34927,Pose x And x Name.,122,You know nothing about me.
34928,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If you judge me by my appearance, you'll get burned."
34929,Pose x And x Name.,122,You have it backwards.
34930,Pose x And x Name.,122,You don't seem like some ordinary man \Nwho can't read the state of the battle.
34931,Pose x And x Name.,122,I was born to rule this world.
34932,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Originally, you humans were as \Nno more than livestock to me."
34933,Pose x And x Name.,122,But I have changed my mind.
34934,Pose x And x Name.,122,I learned that there are a few \Nhumans worth keeping alive.
34935,Pose x And x Name.,122,Like that woman.
34936,Pose x And x Name.,122,"I sense that you are worthy, as well."
34937,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If you back down now,"
34938,Pose x And x Name.,122,I am willing to spare your life.
34939,Pose x And x Name.,122,"You'll only spare my life, yes?"
34940,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Given my position,"
34941,Pose x And x Name.,122,I can't accept that offer.
34942,Pose x And x Name.,122,Meanwhile...
34943,Pose x And x Name.,122,"In exchange for his agreement to stay still,"
34944,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain \Njust what had happened.
34945,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling \Nhim what happened after the attack."
34946,Pose x And x Name.,122,"In other words, everything since \Nthey'd been separated."
34947,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Pitou made it a point to include \Ndetails that Gon did not know, to ensure that Gon's attention would \Nbe focused on the explanation."
34948,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pitou deliberately did not mention \Nhow the King had held Komugi because Pitou did not know how to \Ndescribe the events accurately.
34949,Pose x And x Name.,122,There was no significant change in Gon.
34950,Pose x And x Name.,122,However...
34951,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pitou knew the plan had succeeded \Nwhen Gon's eyes wavered briefly.
34952,Pose x And x Name.,122,"The King... left with the enemy of his own \Nvolition, by that doorway."
34953,Pose x And x Name.,122,There is no need for us to go.
34954,Pose x And x Name.,122,I see.
34955,Pose x And x Name.,122,He went south.
34956,Pose x And x Name.,122,I understand.
34957,Pose x And x Name.,122,"A fine play, Pitou."
34958,Pose x And x Name.,122,Then we should await the King's return here.
34959,Pose x And x Name.,122,"To maintain only my outward appearance, \NI only need one-seventh of my flies."
34960,Pose x And x Name.,122,The other six-sevenths will go to the King!
34961,Pose x And x Name.,122,You fight with the resolve to lose?
34962,Pose x And x Name.,122,I do not understand.
34963,Pose x And x Name.,122,You fight for the human race?
34964,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If so, then know that my actions \Nare, in fact, for their benefit."
34965,Pose x And x Name.,122,"For example, in human society, lands are divided by national borders, \Nmuch like territorial marking."
34966,Pose x And x Name.,122,"On the right side of the border, \Nchildren may starve to death."
34967,Pose x And x Name.,122,"While on the left, scum who do nothing\Nhave everything they need."
34968,Pose x And x Name.,122,Absolute madness.
34969,Pose x And x Name.,122,I shall crush that madness...
34970,Pose x And x Name.,122,"And create a world so fair, the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!"
34971,Pose x And x Name.,122,I concede that
34972,Pose x And x Name.,122,I will initially use power and terror \Nto accomplish my objective.
34973,Pose x And x Name.,122,But I will only do so to the extent \Nnecessary to maintain order.
34974,Pose x And x Name.,122,I have learned what power \Nis meant to be used for.
34975,Pose x And x Name.,122,"To protect the weak, who deserve to live."
34976,Pose x And x Name.,122,Power is not meant to be used \Nto torment the defeated!
34977,Pose x And x Name.,122,This could be a problem...
34978,Pose x And x Name.,122,I shall not fight you.
34979,Pose x And x Name.,122,"I agreed to leave the palace so we could have a free, open discussion."
34980,Pose x And x Name.,122,He's wavering...
34981,Pose x And x Name.,122,Come closer.
34982,Pose x And x Name.,122,Wavering between Ant and human.
34983,Pose x And x Name.,122,And he hasn't realized that those two sides are incompatible.
34984,Pose x And x Name.,122,And neither one is dominant yet.
34985,Pose x And x Name.,122,"But regardless of which side he falls to, the outcome won't change."
34986,Pose x And x Name.,122,We're counting on you.
34987,Pose x And x Name.,122,You have a single mission.
34988,Pose x And x Name.,122,The immediate extermination \Nof these dangerous creatures.
34989,Pose x And x Name.,122,There have already been many casualties.
34990,Pose x And x Name.,122,We will use any means necessary.
34991,Pose x And x Name.,122,Will that be acceptable?
34992,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Naturally, we have no intention of \Ntelling the experts how to proceed."
34993,Pose x And x Name.,122,We simply desire those dangerous creatures \Neradicated as swiftly as possible.
34994,Pose x And x Name.,122,Understood.
34995,Pose x And x Name.,122,"So their goal is to eradicate the Ants, \Nleaving the Hunters Association to take the blame."
34996,Pose x And x Name.,122,I must make this fast...
34997,Pose x And x Name.,122,Before my heart is swayed.
34998,Pose x And x Name.,122,King...
34999,Pose x And x Name.,122,We are both in difficult positions.
35000,Pose x And x Name.,122,100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva
35001,Pose x And x Name.,122,100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!
35002,Pose x And x Name.,122,First Hand
35003,Pose x And x Name.,122,First Hand!
35004,Pose x And x Name.,122,That's...
35005,Pose x And x Name.,122,I can't sense anyone else fighting.
35006,Pose x And x Name.,122,Does that mean I'm the only one left?
35007,Pose x And x Name.,122,Youpi!
35008,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pouf!
35009,Pose x And x Name.,122,You've changed a lot since I last saw you.
35010,Pose x And x Name.,122,I could say the same to you.
35011,Pose x And x Name.,122,I had to escape without alerting the enemy.
35012,Pose x And x Name.,122,"And if I move all my dispersed particles \Nat once, it's too conspicuous."
35013,Pose x And x Name.,122,So I must go slowly.
35014,Pose x And x Name.,122,"I'm sure you're feeling impatient, \Nbut please spare me a moment."
35015,Pose x And x Name.,122,I need to tell you what's happening.
35016,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Well, I suppose you have your own concerns..."
35017,Pose x And x Name.,122,You've grown up.
35018,Pose x And x Name.,122,And there you have it.
35019,Pose x And x Name.,122,I have no conclusive proof that the change in Pitou will \Nactually benefit the King...
35020,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Through his own experiences, \NYoupi could understand Pitou's behavior."
35021,Pose x And x Name.,122,Youpi...
35022,Pose x And x Name.,122,What do you think we should do?
35023,Pose x And x Name.,122,This was a test.
35024,Pose x And x Name.,122,Which made it very clear to Youpi that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes
35025,Pose x And x Name.,122,Pitou and Youpi had undergone.
35026,Pose x And x Name.,122,A foolish question.
35027,Pose x And x Name.,122,We must go to the King at once!
35028,Pose x And x Name.,122,And that's all there is to it... Right?
35029,Pose x And x Name.,122,His response was entirely sincere.
35030,Pose x And x Name.,122,Indeed.
35031,Pose x And x Name.,122,He was concerned only with \Nleaving as soon as possible.
35032,Pose x And x Name.,122,Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.
35033,Pose x And x Name.,122,I'm sure that was a direct hit...
35034,Pose x And x Name.,122,He's tough!
35035,Pose x And x Name.,122,A good attack.
35036,Pose x And x Name.,122,I could not anticipate it.
35037,Pose x And x Name.,122,Are you satisfied now?
35038,Pose x And x Name.,122,He still wants me to sit with him?
35039,Pose x And x Name.,122,I shall not repeat myself.
35040,Pose x And x Name.,122,Third Hand
35041,Pose x And x Name.,122,Third Hand!
35042,Pose x And x Name.,122,I can no longer back down!
35043,Pose x And x Name.,122,Are you really so eager to die?
35044,Pose x And x Name.,122,"From the King's perspective, the wrath that was unleashed was no stronger than that \Nof a child throwing a fit."
35045,Pose x And x Name.,122,Yet it was violent enough to induce \NNetero to more than double the distance between the King and him.
35046,Pose x And x Name.,122,It was an insult likened to laughing off
35047,Pose x And x Name.,122,Netero's declaration that he would not back down.
35048,Pose x And x Name.,122,Come on...
35049,Pose x And x Name.,122,You will only influence me by using words.
35050,Pose x And x Name.,122,Damned newborn brat.
35051,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If it were that simple, \NI wouldn't have to do this!"
35052,Pose x And x Name.,122,Wait...
35053,Pose x And x Name.,122,By using... words?
35054,Pose x And x Name.,122,King...
35055,Pose x And x Name.,122,Would you like to know your name?
35056,Pose x And x Name.,122,How would you know my name?
35057,Pose x And x Name.,122,My subordinates were present at the \Nmoment of your mother's passing.
35058,Pose x And x Name.,122,She uttered your name with her dying breath.
35059,Pose x And x Name.,122,And my subordinates may have died \Nfighting your Royal Guard by now.
35060,Pose x And x Name.,122,Interested in fighting me now?
35061,Pose x And x Name.,122,"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
35062,Pose x And x Name.,122,I will tell you your name.
35063,Pose x And x Name.,122,Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
35064,Pose x And x Name.,122,"So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap..."
35065,Pose x And x Name.,122,No matter.
35066,Pose x And x Name.,122,I shall checkmate you shortly.
35067,Pose x And x Name.,122,The real battle between Netero \Nand the King has begun.
35068,Pose x And x Name.,122,Next time: Centipede x And x Memory.
35069,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Hey, what do you want to be in your next life?"
35070,Pose x And x Name.,122,"Uh, what do you want to be?"
35071,Pose x And x Name.,122,"In my next life, I want to be me, \Nand meet you again."
35072,Pose x And x Name.,122,Stupid!
35073,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Wait...
35074,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,By using... words?
35075,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,King...
35076,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Would you like to know your name?
35077,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,How would you know my name?
35078,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,My subordinates were present at the \Nmoment of your mother's passing.
35079,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,She uttered your name with her dying breath.
35080,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,And my subordinates may have died \Nfighting your Royal Guard by now.
35081,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Interested in fighting me now?
35082,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
35083,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I will tell you your name.
35084,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
35085,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap..."
35086,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,No matter.
35087,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I shall checkmate you shortly.
35088,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Centipede x And x Memory
35089,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,As the King and Netero prepared \Nfor their final battle...
35090,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing, having failed to finish off \Nthe unconscious Brovada."
35091,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Fire! This is the best option!
35092,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,There's no one else to help me!
35093,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I h-have to... kill him!
35094,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,This is no time to be crying...
35095,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I have to find Palm!
35096,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Huh?
35097,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The door to the warehouse area is open.
35098,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,So is the door leading to the garage!
35099,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Why?
35100,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Don't move!
35101,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If you move, I'll attack."
35102,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Welfin...
35103,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I have a lot of things to ask you.
35104,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If you seem to be trying anything funny,"
35105,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'll kill you!
35106,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What he wants to ask me is obvious!
35107,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"The number of my allies, their roles, and their abilities."
35108,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,And he intends to use any means \Nnecessary to get the answers.
35109,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,People could die if I leak information.
35110,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If he's a Manipulator, he can obtain the information against my will."
35111,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Huh?
35112,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,D-Don't move!
35113,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I really will kill you!
35114,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Go ahead... Kill me.
35115,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,That's what I want!
35116,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Stop!
35117,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If the alternative is betraying my buddies,"
35118,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'll take you with me!
35119,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Ouch!
35120,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Bastard! Now you've done it!
35121,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Damn it!
35122,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'll kill you!
35123,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Missile Man!
35124,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm... not dead...
35125,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I didn't sustain any damage.
35126,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What was that attack?
35127,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Damn, that hurts..."
35128,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,You little punk...
35129,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Damn...
35130,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,That bastard... How did a wimp like \Nthat figure out my weakness?
35131,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.
35132,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If an enemy attacks before I can ask \Na question, it's null and void!"
35133,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The wound isn't deep...
35134,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.
35135,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Huh?
35136,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,He planted something inside me?
35137,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Nen{\i0
35138,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,They're black centipedes.
35139,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Black Centipede
35140,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,They grow by feeding on your resistance.
35141,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me, you'll suffer excruciating pain, then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!"
35142,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Wh-What are you doing, fool?"
35143,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Weren't you listening to me?
35144,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,If you try to do that...
35145,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,That's fine with me.
35146,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!"
35147,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,S-Stop!
35148,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"No, wait..."
35149,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If he wanted to kill me, that's the \Nultimate form of resistance."
35150,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes \Nto grow large enough to kill him instantly!"
35151,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Don't worry.
35152,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm not interested in killing you...
35153,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I just need to make sure that you can't leave.
35154,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I still... have plenty of bullets.
35155,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Bastard! Don't mess with me!
35156,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'll kill you!
35157,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,You're dead! I'll kill you!
35158,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,It's so easy.
35159,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"When I'm prepared to offer my own life, it's so easy to pull the trigger."
35160,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I g-get it...
35161,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"I get it, already."
35162,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I won't go anywhere!
35163,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I surrender.
35164,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Please... Don't fire!
35165,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The pain is going away.
35166,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The creatures inside me are suffering?
35167,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"I lose, damn it..."
35168,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I can't move anymore.
35169,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?
35170,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Man, I knew it..."
35171,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I had a feeling this would happen eventually.
35172,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,But still...
35173,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I didn't think I was this weak!
35174,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I didn't think it'd be so scary \Nto face someone who fights with no regard for their own life!
35175,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Hey.
35176,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What?
35177,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"The pain has stopped, but can \Nyou get rid of these bugs?"
35178,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Stop complaining...
35179,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm in too much pain to think about that now!
35180,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Hurry up.
35181,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Give me a minute!
35182,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.
35183,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble..."
35184,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Damn, how do I get out of this?"
35185,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I need to buy time...
35186,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Until I can come up with a good idea.
35187,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The pain is making me... feel faint...
35188,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Wait! Okay!
35189,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I was lying! I won't do it again!
35190,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Then get rid of these.
35191,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Yeah, uh..."
35192,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"So, the thing is..."
35193,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Forget it. I see how it is.
35194,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Wait! Hold on!
35195,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I can't remove them!
35196,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Not once they've been activated!
35197,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,That's why I didn't want to say anything.
35198,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,It's the truth! Believe me!
35199,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm not trying to trick you!
35200,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The insects are in pain again.
35201,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?
35202,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Can you really blame me?
35203,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.
35204,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I never cared what happened after that.
35205,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I never gave any thought to \Nwhat happened to my enemy.
35206,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Nen{\i0
35207,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,My abilities reflect my own personality.
35208,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,My personality? His true intentions?
35209,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Welfin...
35210,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What do I ask him?
35211,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What do I want to know?
35212,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I once knew someone just like him.
35213,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Do you have any memories from \Nwhen you were human?
35214,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Wh-Why are you asking about that?
35215,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I can't remember...
35216,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,You're lying.
35217,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Wh-What?
35218,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Stop! Hold on!
35219,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Calm down!
35220,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you."
35221,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"When I woke up, my first thought was..."
35222,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Damn...
35223,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I can still remember it.
35224,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.
35225,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"I was fed to the Queen, \Nand reborn as something new..."
35226,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,But I still...
35227,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I still remember the one thing \NI most wanted to forget.
35228,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"The sight of my father strangling me, and the woman watching behind him."
35229,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"At first, I only had flashbacks of it."
35230,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Over time, I remembered the \Nentire sequence of events."
35231,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"I was saved by... my little brother, who was unrelated by blood."
35232,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I remember now!
35233,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,He looked just like Gyro!
35234,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Gyro?
35235,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,You know. The king!
35236,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,We used to brag about whose \Nlife was more miserable.
35237,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,He was the only one I could \Nturn to when I needed to laugh away my tears...
35238,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,We were both empty.
35239,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,So we had nothing to hide.
35240,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I wonder what he's doing now...
35241,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I want to see him one more time...
35242,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Yes, I just want to see Gyro."
35243,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans, with money and nations..."
35244,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Go.
35245,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,The bugs are gone.
35246,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,You still have something to do.
35247,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Why did you open the doors?
35248,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Oh, I was letting those weaklings \Nreach the treasure in the back."
35249,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,They can't put up much of a fight.
35250,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.
35251,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,And I told them to pass while \Nyou were on the way back.
35252,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,A coward!
35253,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,It was that simple.
35254,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,"
35255,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I thought you'd be an easy target.
35256,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I couldn't have been more wrong.
35257,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Go on.
35258,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm too tired to move...
35259,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I have one last question.
35260,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Did you see a woman in the palace?
35261,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,A woman?
35262,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Not sure if it's the one you're talking about, but the Royal Guard captured a human, \Nand put her in a cocoon."
35263,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Where is she?
35264,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"Take the elevator up, then turn left."
35265,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,It's the room at the end of the hall.
35266,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,They called it #1.
35267,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Thank you!
35268,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,What's so funny?
35269,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Telling the truth feels really good...
35270,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Welfin had spent his life unable \Nto trust himself or others.
35271,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Telling Ikalgo the location of \Nthe one he searched for was the first time he'd opened \Nup and spoken honestly.
35272,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.
35273,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm just... I'm just...
35274,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,"What's wrong, Killua?"
35275,Centipede x And x Memory.,123,I'm here for you.
35276,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Approximately thirty minutes after \Nthe Hunters entered the palace...
35277,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace, an immense number of citizens \Nhypnotized by Pouf's wing scales still waited outside for the selection process \Nthat would turn them into soldier ants."
35278,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Meanwhile, a creature in the form that \Nthey would soon become began to stir."
35279,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Breakdown x And x Awakening
35280,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Okay, all charged up."
35281,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Someone's watching me.
35282,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,And...
35283,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,It's probably someone I know.
35284,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,No one's there?
35285,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"While her appearance hadn't totally changed,"
35286,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm was clearly no longer the same person.
35287,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,And that greatly disturbed Killua.
35288,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,She was captured by the Royal Guard...
35289,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,And she's been transformed!
35290,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"If Gon sees what's happened to Palm, he won't be able to take it..."
35291,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,There's no room left in his heart.
35292,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,If the transformation has \Nreached as far as Palm's heart...
35293,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I can see Gon completely breaking down!
35294,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I must learn the answer.
35295,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,We still have a chance.
35296,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm approached me herself!
35297,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm?
35298,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm must have sensed me before I noticed her watching me...
35299,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Using that power she told us about before.
35300,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Once I used my power, it was quite simple."
35301,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I thought she could use some kind \Nof divination to locate people.
35302,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.
35303,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"From her position, Palm shouldn't \Nhave been able to see me..."
35304,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,The only conclusion is that she was \Nwatching me by some other means.
35305,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"And if Palm were an enemy, \Nshe would have backed off..."
35306,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.
35307,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't \Nremember me anymore."
35308,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Since she approached me, she must remember me..."
35309,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Remember us!
35310,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Killua, yes?"
35311,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I knew it...
35312,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,She has her memories!
35313,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Where's Gon?
35314,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Once he's seen what I've \Nbecome, will Gon hate me?"
35315,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.
35316,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,And you're assuming that he \Ndoesn't already hate you.
35317,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,You're always so spiteful...
35318,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Well, it doesn't matter."
35319,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I have nothing to gain from your pity.
35320,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Where's Gon?
35321,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon's with Pitou.
35322,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,He's—
35323,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Why can she see me, but she can't see Gon?"
35324,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,What's wrong?
35325,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Was it chance that you happened to find me?
35326,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Huh? What are you talking about?
35327,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,You're the one who turned the corner.
35328,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Wrong! I sensed you watching me.
35329,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That's why I came this way!
35330,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,You noticed me first.
35331,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Why are you lying?
35332,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Troublesome brat...
35333,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Where's Gon?
35334,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Answer my question first.
35335,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Did I notice Palm watching me \Nonly when she physically saw me?
35336,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Does that mean Palm actually \Nsaw me once, then immediately left?"
35337,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Then she used clairvoyance \Nto watch me follow her, and turned around so it'd look \Nlike she was approaching me?"
35338,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,For the last time...
35339,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Where's Gon?
35340,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I won't tell you.
35341,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"You're an enemy, aren't you?"
35342,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I made a mistake...
35343,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I used my power incorrectly.
35344,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"When I was brimming with rage,"
35345,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I should have let my emotions take over!
35346,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Black Widow\NDark Demon Goddess
35347,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Sh-She's dangerous!
35348,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Better to let everything out than hold it in.
35349,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That includes my desire to kill you!
35350,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Well? What now?
35351,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Will you die without a word?
35352,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Will you die after speaking?
35353,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Or will you just die?
35354,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Palm's ability to arm herself by covering \Nher body with her hair, Black Widow, varied in appearance according\Nto her emotional state."
35355,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,But defense was its primary function.
35356,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"What made Black Widow frightening was the fact that she could rely on \Nher hair armor for protection, allowing her to devote all \Nher energy to her attacks."
35357,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,P-Palm-san! Turn off your {\i0
35358,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm is an Enhancer.
35359,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"When everything clicks, it's possible \Nto become this much stronger?"
35360,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"I completely blocked the attack, \Nbut I still took damage."
35361,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage."
35362,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,But I can't run away.
35363,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon's mind is already at its limit!
35364,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"He's barely holding himself together, \Nwhile he waits for Pitou."
35365,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I can't let them meet.
35366,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Even if Palm's heart is still there...
35367,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,It'll have a negative effect now!
35368,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm!
35369,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Why are you looking for Gon?
35370,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Depending on why, I might be \Nwilling to tell you where he is."
35371,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Huh? Why are you asking now?
35372,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,There's no reason...
35373,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I just want to see him.
35374,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,He's probably nearby.
35375,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I'll find him myself.
35376,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Once I've killed you!
35377,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Sorry!
35378,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I panicked and called you an enemy...
35379,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"But even if you look different, \Nyou're still Palm, right?"
35380,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon is suffering.
35381,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Someone he deeply respects \Nwas completely transformed.
35382,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That person had his soul taken away.
35383,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Right now, Gon is facing off \Nagainst the one responsible!"
35384,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,If you appear before Gon \Nlooking as you do now...
35385,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon will... totally snap.
35386,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,So you have to call him by his name first.
35387,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"You must say, ""Gon."""
35388,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That's the condition.
35389,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Tell him you're okay.
35390,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Before we entered the palace,"
35391,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Gon was really worried about you.
35392,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Give him some peace of mind...
35393,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,He was just buying time.
35394,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,He had no intention of letting them meet.
35395,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That was the idea...
35396,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Help... make him feel a little better, if you can..."
35397,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Only you can do that now!
35398,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,No one else... can do it.
35399,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I can't... do anything!
35400,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Once he'd said those words, the dam within him burst."
35401,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,He's completely defenseless.
35402,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Change in plans...
35403,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Kill him now, #1!"
35404,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"When Palm had infiltrated the palace, arriving at the exit Knov had \Nplaced near the stairway,"
35405,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,En{\i0
35406,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt \Nas though she'd be crushed to dust, she reached the same conclusion Knov had."
35407,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"As she watched Pouf slowly and silently \Ndescend the stairs, she made her decision."
35408,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"She plotted to take her own life, so she would look like a despairing girl \Nwho could not bear Bizeff violating her."
35409,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"However, Pitou prevented that from happening."
35410,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"As one cannot help but shiver in the cold, no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura \Nat the moment she was exposed to it."
35411,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"The Royal Guard was interested in her aura, and after receiving permission from the fasting King,"
35412,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.
35413,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.
35414,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Nen{\i0
35415,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Memories of the past tended to both assist \Nand deter the growth of soldiers.
35416,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Deterrence generally happened when memories led to emotional reactions.
35417,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded \Nthat they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe to destroy the connection between \NPalm's memories and her emotions."
35418,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,The experiments that produced Cheetu \Nand Leol confirmed that those who retained more of their memories \Nemerged from their cocoons sooner.
35419,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"To quickly and quietly conquer humanity, leaving soldiers with their memories, while \Nkeeping control of them, would be best."
35420,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm was the perfect test subject.
35421,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,The success of her experiment would \Nsignify the end of the human race.
35422,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Now go, #1..."
35423,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Beat the kid before you to death!
35424,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Shut up.
35425,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I am
35426,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Palm Siberia.
35427,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I'm not #1!
35428,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I will never become a pawn to you Ants...
35429,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Even if it costs my life!
35430,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Killua...
35431,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I have you to thank.
35432,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,There was a wall inside my head.
35433,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,My emotions were separated from my body.
35434,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I couldn't do anything about it.
35435,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I've been like this since I woke up.
35436,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,You removed the barrier.
35437,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Don't say that there's nothing you can do.
35438,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to."
35439,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,But you must not forget...
35440,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,You are the one Gon needs most.
35441,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,What is it?
35442,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Failure.
35443,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That's all there is to it.
35444,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Slow and steady it is.
35445,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...
35446,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.
35447,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,I can create soldiers on my own!
35448,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,That will make it easier \Nto build a new kingdom for the King and me.
35449,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,Next time: Great Power x And x Ultimate Power
35450,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Oh, Knuckle... You're lending me this manga?"
35451,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Wait, this is mine."
35452,Breakdown x And x Awakening.,124,"Oh, well."
35453,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Killua...
35454,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I have you to thank.
35455,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I've been like this since I woke up.
35456,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Don't say that there's nothing you can do.
35457,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to."
35458,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,But you must not forget...
35459,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You are the one Gon needs most.
35460,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power
35461,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon miraculously returned Palm to her old self.
35462,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,"
35463,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings, appearing before those in the room in order to challenge Pouf."
35464,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pouf...
35465,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Step outside.
35466,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Very well.
35467,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I will face you.
35468,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"But first, I have something to say."
35469,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,That which stands before you is only a clone.
35470,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,My true body is already on its way to the King.
35471,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Having escaped the cage of smoke,"
35472,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle \Nand Morel had made contact.
35473,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"He decided to assume that his enemies knew of \Nhis ability to create clones, and to act accordingly."
35474,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,That was the correct call.
35475,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,The boss told me that you could make clones.
35476,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You're telling the truth.
35477,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.
35478,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted \Nto gain the mental advantage."
35479,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,His plan was a success.
35480,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,But why are you telling me this?
35481,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pouf's concern was Youpi.
35482,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Since Knuckle was here, that meant that Youpi had spared his life and had not told Pouf this."
35483,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Depending on his reason...
35484,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Answer me!
35485,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,To satisfy him.
35486,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully \Nso that he could persuade Knuckle to tell him the motive behind the \Ntransformation he'd sensed in Youpi.
35487,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I told you in order to satisfy him.
35488,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,He has demanded that I not leave this room.
35489,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If we are to engage in a duel,"
35490,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"I will need him to withdraw his \Ndemand, so that I may leave."
35491,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I am but a clone...
35492,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I cannot use my wing scales.
35493,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"However, I am still willing to fight you."
35494,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,What I seek is a discussion.
35495,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,That is why I revealed the truth.
35496,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who \Nwould call him from behind to challenge him, appearing to be telling the truth \Nwould be more effective."
35497,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You're lying...
35498,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You were going to kill me from behind.
35499,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You even admitted it.
35500,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Knuckle, don't let him fool you!"
35501,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"First, you claim to be a clone."
35502,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Are you able to prove that?
35503,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,He's right.
35504,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,This boy is proving troublesome.
35505,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"I dare say that, of our enemies, \Nhe possesses the strongest will."
35506,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Perhaps I should be pleased that he is trapped here with Pitou.
35507,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Because his strong will keeps him in here.
35508,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Were I to prove myself a clone, I would \Nbe placing myself at a disadvantage."
35509,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,So I can say nothing.
35510,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You must use your own judgment.
35511,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,And...
35512,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I shall allow you to decide what happens next.
35513,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Pouf, you can't mean to..."
35514,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Stop...
35515,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.
35516,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Whether you come or not is your choice!
35517,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Please wait...
35518,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I'm still here!
35519,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I apologize for Pouf's behavior!
35520,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"I'm the only one you need, right?"
35521,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Ten minutes.
35522,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.
35523,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pitou was trembling.
35524,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,It was disturbing enough that
35525,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Pouf had been willing to leave, \Ndespite the consequences."
35526,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"But what was truly frightening was \Nhow Gon ignored Pouf's taunts, calmly moving up the deadline instead."
35527,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,How long?
35528,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,How long do I have to wait?
35529,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,To completely heal her will take three to four hours.
35530,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"No, I can't wait that long."
35531,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If I have an hour,"
35532,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I can heal her most critical injuries.
35533,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Originally, to protect Komugi \Nand heal her completely,"
35534,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Pitou had deliberately named a longer \Ntime frame than was necessary, which Gon had denied."
35535,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,So the hour that they'd agreed \Nupon was the actual time
35536,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pitou believed necessary for Komugi \Nto make a full recovery.
35537,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"However,"
35538,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.
35539,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,It may have been possible to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.
35540,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Upon thinking this, Pitou realized..."
35541,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"It may have been mere coincidence, but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten \Nminutes to conform with Pouf's parting words."
35542,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Despite that likelihood, Pitou \Ncould not shake a bad feeling."
35543,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I must risk my life.
35544,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Or else his fangs may reach the King's throat!
35545,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I understand.
35546,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Knuckle.
35547,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I'll be fine here alone.
35548,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"I said that Pouf was lying, but it's probably true that his main \Nbody is headed for the King."
35549,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,The King is to the south.
35550,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Gon and Killua had seen everything \Nthat had transpired.
35551,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"But since Pitou did not know that, it was only natural to assume that Gon had seen through Pouf's plans."
35552,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.
35553,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pitou was now fully resolved to \Ncomplete the mission at hand.
35554,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I must kill him.
35555,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,No matter the cost!
35556,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I must kill him...
35557,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,For the King's sake!
35558,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?
35559,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"No, that won't work."
35560,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I can't expose her to danger.
35561,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"First, I must entrust her to someone else."
35562,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.
35563,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,This won't do.
35564,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?"
35565,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Gon,"
35566,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I understand what you're saying.
35567,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,However...
35568,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I will still do things my way.
35569,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Youpi is...
35570,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"No, never mind."
35571,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant, it could result in his death."
35572,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,See ya.
35573,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Knuckle managed to stop himself.
35574,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,How would you know my name?
35575,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,My subordinates were present at the \Nmoment of your mother's passing.
35576,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,She uttered your name with her dying breath.
35577,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,And my subordinates may have died \Nfighting your Royal Guard by now.
35578,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Interested in fighting me now?
35579,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"If you can force me to admit defeat,"
35580,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I will tell you your name.
35581,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
35582,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap..."
35583,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,No matter.
35584,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I shall checkmate you shortly.
35585,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"As the King moved into his stance,"
35586,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Netero took to the air.
35587,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,When was it... that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?
35588,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"Whenever you're ready, come at me."
35589,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...
35590,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva
35591,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Ninety-ninth Hand
35592,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Ninety-ninth Hand!
35593,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,"When was it that I stopped hesitating to be gracious, taking the hands of vanquished opponents when they bowed their heads in defeat?"
35594,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,That cannot be the ultimate power I sought!
35595,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,It is fighting with all my soul against an opponent with the strength to defeat me!
35596,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,This is a tomb.
35597,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Your tomb.
35598,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,I am very thankful.
35599,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Thankful for everything that has made our meeting possible!
35600,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Next time: Zero x And x Rose.
35601,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,We haven't seen each other in a while.
35602,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Yeah.
35603,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,But it feels like you were always with me.
35604,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,Yeah.
35605,Great Power x And x Ultimate Power,125,The future is ours.
35606,Zero x And x Rose.,126,This is a tomb.
35607,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Your tomb.
35608,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I am very thankful.
35609,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Thankful for everything that has made our meeting possible!
35610,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Zero x And x Rose
35611,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"As his time was compressed to its utmost limits, the King, his consciousness alone barely following \Nthe afterimages of Netero's movements, found that a single emotion reigned within him..."
35612,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.
35613,Zero x And x Rose.,126,That's it.
35614,Zero x And x Rose.,126,He brings his hands together to start the attack.
35615,Zero x And x Rose.,126,That's the only motion he has \Nthat far surpasses my speed.
35616,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Such wasted movement could \Ncost one's life in battle, but now, it works as a weapon \Nthat may allow him to defeat me."
35617,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Trying to guess what drove \Nhim to do this is pointless.
35618,Zero x And x Rose.,126,It would have required choosing \Na path that defies reason.
35619,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"I would presume that, at one point, \Nhe was on the verge of madness..."
35620,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Five years... Perhaps ten years...
35621,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"And the entire time, he focused on this alone."
35622,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I recognize that you have dedicated an incredible amount of time to achieve the power you have displayed.
35623,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"After all that, he's barely been scratched."
35624,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Not that I expected any different.
35625,Zero x And x Rose.,126,An individual can reach his limit after much training.
35626,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You are a rare example of one \Nwho has transcended that limit.
35627,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Bravo.
35628,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You have earned my praise.
35629,Zero x And x Rose.,126,An insect should not talk down to humans!
35630,Zero x And x Rose.,126,The King's strategy was quite simple.
35631,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Keep attacking.
35632,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If the only attack capable of besting him, \N100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva, could do next to no damage, \Nthe King had no cause for fear."
35633,Zero x And x Rose.,126,These are no more than dummy hands.
35634,Zero x And x Rose.,126,They can only move in set patterns.
35635,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If I attack from an angle that he can't \Nblock with a move he's already used, he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move."
35636,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Once I have verified all of the combinations,"
35637,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I can find the angle of attack that will \Nforce him to reveal another new move.
35638,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"However, while he may have a limited \Nnumber of attack patterns, the number of combinations they can \Nbe used in may as well be infinite."
35639,Zero x And x Rose.,126,But every individual has a rhythm.
35640,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"There will be an unconscious bias for, \Nand against, certain patterns, and that bias naturally shapes one's identity."
35641,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If I can identify his personal rhythm,"
35642,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I have a fair chance of guessing \Nwhich patterns he will select.
35643,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"To find the single correct needle \Namong countless millions, and thread it accurately... is what it will take to pierce my target."
35644,Zero x And x Rose.,126,It may prove difficult...
35645,Zero x And x Rose.,126,But I will succeed.
35646,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I can accomplish it!
35647,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Old soldier, I beg of you..."
35648,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Don't lose your life before I succeed!
35649,Zero x And x Rose.,126,He's laughing?
35650,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him."
35651,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"No matter my attack trajectory, he recovers immediately and moves to counter."
35652,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If I make a wrong move, his speed won't \Nallow me time to unleash the next Hand."
35653,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If I lose focus, he'll tear me \Napart before I realize it."
35654,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"This is a contest of endurance, in which \NI must keep choosing correctly..."
35655,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"When I fail, you win."
35656,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!"
35657,Zero x And x Rose.,126,No matter.
35658,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I shall checkmate you shortly.
35659,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Checkmate me if you can.
35660,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I'll show you my Zero Hand!
35661,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"After hundreds and thousands of hits, the King was beginning to feel the slightest \Nhints of dull pain within his body."
35662,Zero x And x Rose.,126,However...
35663,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Stop the bleeding.
35664,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Then tell me my name.
35665,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You have done well for a human.
35666,Zero x And x Rose.,126,What's wrong?
35667,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss."
35668,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Don't make me laugh.
35669,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I'll die?
35670,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You shouldn't get cocky after \Nlanding a lucky punch...
35671,Zero x And x Rose.,126,The battle's just begun!
35672,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You have truly earned my admiration.
35673,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.
35674,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"However, losing your leg was basically inevitable."
35675,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"It is the consequence of using a defense that, \Nwhile not bad, was not the best choice."
35676,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"After playing against Komugi, I learned \Nthe art of anticipating enemy actions."
35677,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Your unconscious bias against certain patterns gives me insight into the otherwise \Nlimitless options you have.
35678,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Next, I'll take your left arm."
35679,Zero x And x Rose.,126,The ensuing fight did not even last a minute.
35680,Zero x And x Rose.,126,This is my life's final act!
35681,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve heightened his physical and mental senses, resulting in an exchange of more \Nthan a thousand punches, and sparking countless fireworks \Nbetween the combatants."
35682,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"And then, the moment arrived."
35683,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"His attacks began to show a slight inclination, one not quite significant enough \Nto be called a habit or bias."
35684,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"After using his body to bear the \Nbrunt of Netero's attacks, the King was able to find \Nthe faint light beyond, and... he reached it."
35685,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Are you satisfied now?
35686,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Then tell me my name.
35687,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Ant King...
35688,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?
35689,Zero x And x Rose.,126,A prayer comes from the heart.
35690,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If the heart achieves the correct \Nform, it becomes emotion..."
35691,Zero x And x Rose.,126,And emotions may be manifested.
35692,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy, gently enveloping the target \Nwith an indiscriminate love."
35693,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous \Nintent from a great distance away."
35694,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Not this way!
35695,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"It had left such a strong impact, \NKillua had changed his direction."
35696,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"The entirety of Netero's aura was transformed into a light as \Nblinding as a star, and fired with a merciless roar."
35697,Zero x And x Rose.,126,The pinnacle of individual strength.
35698,Zero x And x Rose.,126,That was a magnificent attack.
35699,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Zero wasn't enough?
35700,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"I was born to be King of the Ants, to rule over all organisms."
35701,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"I represent the instinctive hope \Nlong nurtured by my species, and that species continues to evolve for my sake."
35702,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"I stand here now, the resulting boon \Nof the total support of my species."
35703,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"You are an individual human, not a king..."
35704,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I am the King that bears his kind's fate.
35705,Zero x And x Rose.,126,That was the difference in this battle.
35706,Zero x And x Rose.,126,The Chimera Ants' long evolution \Nhas culminated in me.
35707,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"This is a feat the human race, with its \Nindividuality, can never match."
35708,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"However, humans will no longer \Nbe used to propagate our species."
35709,Zero x And x Rose.,126,We have learned that the strong human ego disrupts \Nthe bonds between Ants.
35710,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Out of respect for your efforts,"
35711,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I shall allow humans to permanently \Nsurvive within a special zone.
35712,Zero x And x Rose.,126,We shall reevaluate the number and \Nquality of humans to be used as food.
35713,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Your lonely battle was not in vain...
35714,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I shall not repeat myself again.
35715,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Tell me my name.
35716,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I am not alone.
35717,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem."
35718,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Meruem... That is your name.
35719,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"As Netero spoke the King's name, the King had no time to consider it, as he watched the old man who was \Nsupposed to be surrendering."
35720,Zero x And x Rose.,126,What is this?
35721,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing... of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!"
35722,Zero x And x Rose.,126,It was the first time the King had felt fear.
35723,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"One look at the face of this beaten old man, \Nwho should have been waiting for death, made it clear that his seemingly \Nvain words were no mere boast."
35724,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Should your heart stop beating, this will activate."
35725,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"If there is a hell, I'll see you there."
35726,Zero x And x Rose.,126,I see now...
35727,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Yes... I see...
35728,Zero x And x Rose.,126,You had me in checkmate from the start...
35729,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"The bomb was both low-budget and compact, while also proving surprisingly lethal."
35730,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"With the right technology, it was possible to quickly mass \Nproduce these bombs."
35731,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Due to the shape of the smoke cloud, it was called the Miniature Rose, \Nor the poor man's rose, and was popular with small dictatorships."
35732,Zero x And x Rose.,126,Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.
35733,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"No matter what happens, \NI won't betray my friends."
35734,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"No matter what happens, \NI'll believe in my friends."
35735,Zero x And x Rose.,126,"Thank you, Chairman Netero."
35736,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem."
35737,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Meruem... That is your name.
35738,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,What is this?
35739,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Meruem, King of Ants, you understand nothing... of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!"
35740,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I see now...
35741,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Yes... I see...
35742,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,You had me in checkmate from the start...
35743,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Hostility x And x Determination
35744,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"The bomb was both low-budget and compact, while also proving surprisingly lethal."
35745,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"With the right technology, it was possible to quickly mass \Nproduce these bombs."
35746,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Due to the shape of the smoke cloud, it was called the Miniature Rose, \Nor the poor man's rose, and was popular with small dictatorships."
35747,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"In more than 250 countries and regions of the world, ten times as many roses had bloomed, consuming 5.12 million human lives."
35748,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"After terrorists used the bomb in the \Ncenter of an adversarial nation's capital, taking more than 110,000 lives, an international treaty was signed that \Nbanned the bomb's production."
35749,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"However, over eighty percent of the \Nworld's countries rejected the proposal to discard and ban the use of \Nroses they had already produced, meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds still wait silently in many countries \Nfor their chance to bloom."
35750,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"""How are humans and Ants different?"""
35751,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"When Netero decided to use his last resort, could this thought have crossed his mind?"
35752,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Now, there is no way to find out."
35753,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,The two immediately understood what the distant cloud of smoke and \Nresulting vibration in the air signified.
35754,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"At the same time,"
35755,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.
35756,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"After his experience with Youpi,"
35757,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Knuckle hoped to reach a \Nsimilar understanding with Pouf.
35758,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.
35759,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"If the King waves his baton, the soldiers will become demons if necessary."
35760,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pouf's main body must have learned \Nthat something happened to the King.
35761,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"That led to the transformation of the clone's \Nface, revealing the Ants' true nature."
35762,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Did the chairman defeat the King?
35763,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"No, it doesn't matter either way..."
35764,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier \Nthat could not be overcome."
35765,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,It's destroyed!
35766,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Is everyone okay?
35767,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,This is brutal...
35768,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,It only took them thirty minutes \Nto wreck the whole place.
35769,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,That was close...
35770,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Ikalgo.
35771,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Killua!
35772,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Palm...
35773,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I see.
35774,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But I'm glad to see you.
35775,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,You returned to us.
35776,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car."
35777,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"No, she wants to stay."
35778,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight."
35779,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"In terms of raw offensive power, \Nshe has me beat..."
35780,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Probably.
35781,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once."
35782,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,However...
35783,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I'll wait.
35784,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I'll respect his wishes...
35785,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,His wishes?
35786,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.
35787,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I'll wait right here for one hour.
35788,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"And once he's made up his mind, \Nthat's it. He won't budge."
35789,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"In return, he performs his best when circumstances are as expected."
35790,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.
35791,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,B-But what if...
35792,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Yeah, I know."
35793,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"If he gets into serious trouble, \Nwe'll immediately rush in to help him."
35794,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I see...
35795,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,So that's why they're staying behind.
35796,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has, he still won't be able to beat Pitou."
35797,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"In fact, even if the three of us join him, they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou."
35798,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,They're staying behind to die with him!
35799,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.
35800,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Want to come?
35801,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Absolutely.
35802,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Okay, let's go."
35803,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,We separated the King and the Royal Guard to let the chairman defeat the King.
35804,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"As Knov-san said, we've completed \Nthe mission we were assigned."
35805,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Each of us will have to decide \Nwhere we go from here.
35806,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Do we stop or keep going?
35807,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I am going to keep fighting them.
35808,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I've already laid down my life here more than once.
35809,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Even if we can't reach an understanding,"
35810,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.
35811,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,You're finished.
35812,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Why did he say that?
35813,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,There's still time left...
35814,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Did he notice that my surgery was done?
35815,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I made sure to hide my progress from him.
35816,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"But if I showed any sign of \Nrelaxing after finishing it, and he noticed that..."
35817,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I must kill him.
35818,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,No matter the cost!
35819,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I must kill him...
35820,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,For the King's sake!
35821,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Did he notice my bloodlust then?
35822,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Stand up.
35823,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,We move to Peijing now.
35824,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Running is faster for us.
35825,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,What happened to me?
35826,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I would like to—
35827,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her."
35828,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,S-Sorry!
35829,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Am I interrupting something?
35830,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"U-Um, I don't understand what's going on..."
35831,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I understand.
35832,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Let's go.
35833,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pitou was close enough to take \Noff his head with one arm.
35834,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But Pitou couldn't move.
35835,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,"
35836,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pitou's instincts said to obey.
35837,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I can't make a move now...
35838,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,My chance will come.
35839,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"There'll be many, on our way to Peijing."
35840,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But I must get Komugi to the King!
35841,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Gon, want me to use Chapter 7 \NBankruptcy on Pitou?"
35842,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"If there's an escape attempt, \NI can track Pitou down."
35843,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"And if Pitou tries to fight back, \NAPR will protect you."
35844,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Thank you, Knuckle."
35845,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But it's okay.
35846,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I trust Pitou...
35847,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"So until Pitou and I have met with Kite, keep an eye on her."
35848,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,A-Are you talking about me?
35849,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Is he going to use Komugi...
35850,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,As a hostage?!
35851,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go."
35852,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?"
35853,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pitou?
35854,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"You sure about this, Killua?"
35855,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,You aren't going with Gon?
35856,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,We were...
35857,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon."
35858,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,But Gon didn't want him to come!
35859,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pitou and I will go by ourselves.
35860,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,It's okay.
35861,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,That was always the plan.
35862,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.
35863,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,You mean the hostage?
35864,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along, and Pitou managed to capture me."
35865,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Then Pitou would have the option \Nto exchange hostages.
35866,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Seriously...
35867,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,What have they been through for \Ntheir minds to work this way?
35868,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,It's all right.
35869,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,"
35870,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I'll know immediately if something happens.
35871,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Besides, Pitou won't abandon her."
35872,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Which means that Gon is safe.
35873,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I can't understand what's going on.
35874,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Where is the Supreme Leader?
35875,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Who are these people?
35876,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"The heat of the explosion had \Nmelted the rock into magma, leaving a scene resembling the \Nmouth of an active volcano, producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke that prevented the living from entering."
35877,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Pouf!
35878,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"I'll search inside, so I need you to \Nsearch the surrounding area."
35879,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,It's possible that the explosion \Nsent the King flying.
35880,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I was wrong...
35881,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"We will kill them all, with the King at our side."
35882,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,None will be spared!
35883,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Your Majesty!
35884,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.
35885,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,"Before he could even see the truth for himself, tears were already streaming down Pouf's face."
35886,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Your Majesty!
35887,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Your Majesty!
35888,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Next time:
35889,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.
35890,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,I never ask for anything in return.
35891,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Isn't that unconditional love?
35892,Hostility x And x Determination.,127,Unparalleled joy.
35893,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"With the detonation of Miniature Rose, \Nthe bomb activated by the stopping of his heart,"
35894,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Netero perished with the King.
35895,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love
35896,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35897,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,He's breathing!
35898,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,But damn it...
35899,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We must hurry... Or it'll \Nbe too late for the King!
35900,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,And there isn't time to take him to Pitou!
35901,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It will be fine...
35902,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I will save the King.
35903,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,How?
35904,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I will feed myself to him...
35905,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,That's all there is to it.
35906,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Come, my cells!"
35907,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Diffuse throughout the King and heal him!
35908,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35909,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty...
35910,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Are you all right?
35911,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,How do you feel?
35912,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This exquisite taste...
35913,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I feel as though I am breathing the air of paradise.
35914,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,My strength is returning...
35915,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This is a fairy mist.
35916,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I am...
35917,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I am not worthy of such praise!
35918,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I am happy to hear that.
35919,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Please feast to your heart's content.
35920,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,There is plenty here.
35921,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I crave it...
35922,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Now that I have experienced this taste,"
35923,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I cannot eat anything else...
35924,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty...
35925,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Your Majesty, Your Majesty, Your Majesty!"
35926,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Please stop taking me to the heights \Nof heaven's bliss with your praise!
35927,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,No more!
35928,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35929,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35930,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You may also feed on this.
35931,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,He's liquefying his cells.
35932,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"You thought this through, Youpi."
35933,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It's so powerful and rich...
35934,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Surely, this comes from the heavens."
35935,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Drops of angels themselves...
35936,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35937,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,There is no way to compare the two.
35938,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,All I can say is that I have never tasted better...
35939,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Not enough...
35940,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I need more.
35941,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Bring me as much as you can of both...
35942,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Yes!
35943,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,My King!
35944,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,With pleasure!
35945,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Supreme bliss...
35946,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Unparalleled joy.
35947,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What is this?
35948,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What is this feeling?
35949,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"From now on, call me Meruem..."
35950,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,That is the name my mother gave me.
35951,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I see...
35952,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,So this is...
35953,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,...unconditional love!
35954,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Having witnessed an absolute \Nbeing's death and rebirth, and having shared their own beings with the King,"
35955,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Pouf and Youpi had at last reached the pinnacle of their species... \NThe level of Queen.
35956,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It's clear that his strength has increased.
35957,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,He's even stronger now!
35958,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Our bodies have helped the King...
35959,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,And become part of him.
35960,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What an honor... What bliss!
35961,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The King's heartbeat! The King's warmth!
35962,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We even share the King's thoughts!
35963,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,However...
35964,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,That is why we know...
35965,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The King is currently...
35966,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,...confused.
35967,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Your Majesty!
35968,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,M-Meruem-sama...
35969,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,How do you feel?
35970,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Should we return to the palace first?
35971,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"If you wish for more of that food, \Nwe can provide it."
35972,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"In a few minutes, my clones will arrive."
35973,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Food...
35974,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Ah...
35975,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Then that taste was real.
35976,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"As I wandered through the light, \NI heard someone call my name."
35977,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Calling, ""Meruem."""
35978,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I do not know if that was a dream or reality.
35979,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I cannot remember why
35980,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I am here.
35981,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Meruem-sama...
35982,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You've lost your memory?
35983,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I feel fine.
35984,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"In fact, I am brimming with energy."
35985,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,But my mind is hazy...
35986,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Why have your appearances changed?
35987,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We sent our clones to scout the area.
35988,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,They are searching for remaining \Nenemies to dispose of—
35989,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You may have my best interests in mind.
35990,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"But when you lie to me, you betray me."
35991,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You will not get a second chance.
35992,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"So, I was eating you."
35993,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We offered ourselves to you!
35994,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We know we acted beyond our places!
35995,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,But we made the decision!
35996,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What happened? Give me an explanation.
35997,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Before we can do that, \NI must ask you one question."
35998,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It appears that you recall \Nour former appearances.
35999,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Do you remember the day \Nwe first began serving you?
36000,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I do not.
36001,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I recognized that you were my \NRoyal Guards Pouf and Youpi the moment I saw you.
36002,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"No, I should say I remembered that you were."
36003,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"However, I cannot recall anything \Nabout how that came to be."
36004,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Meruem-sama...
36005,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I believe you are suffering from temporary \Nmemory loss due to the explosion.
36006,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Explosion?
36007,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Yes.
36008,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You came here to engage \Nin a duel with the enemy.
36009,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"However, the cowardly human resorted to the underhanded \Ntrick of using a powerful bomb, betraying your honorable intentions!"
36010,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,A duel...
36011,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Yes...
36012,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I was fighting a duel.
36013,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"We knew that, given your power and fortune, a mere human weapon could \Nnever deal a lethal blow."
36014,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"However, we could not bear \Nto see you in that state."
36015,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"So we did what we could to speed your recovery, knowing full well that we might be punished."
36016,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Our bodies have always been yours.
36017,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We were simply returning them to you.
36018,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Let's return to the palace!
36019,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,That will be the fastest way \Nfor you to regain your memory!
36020,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This is my perfect chance!
36021,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"If I return to the palace first,"
36022,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I can dispose of her!
36023,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"At the moment, the King does not remember her."
36024,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"If I eliminate her now, he will never have the chance to remember her!"
36025,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This will require...
36026,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Convincing Pitou?
36027,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Getting rid of that meddling human?
36028,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,No...
36029,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The first thing to do is to end her life.
36030,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"If I kill her, everything else will fall into place."
36031,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"The King will need twenty \Nminutes to reach the palace, and that is if he runs at full speed."
36032,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I have enough time to kill her.
36033,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This feels as natural as though \NI was born with these.
36034,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I will learn to fly in no time.
36035,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Which way to the palace?
36036,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,North.
36037,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,You should be able to make \Nit in fifteen minutes!
36038,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It's there.
36039,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The answer I seek is in the palace.
36040,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,He is fast!
36041,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"If I waste too much time, he'll catch up!"
36042,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Fifteen minutes?
36043,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"No, at this speed, he'll arrive in five minutes..."
36044,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I have but two to three minutes.
36045,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Quickly, my clones!"
36046,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,This is a gamble.
36047,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Once the King sees the millions \Nof humans outside the palace, he will remember everything!"
36048,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Remember that his objective \Nis to rule all living creatures!
36049,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,So long as he doesn't see that woman!
36050,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,As a Royal Guard...
36051,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,As one who has inherited the Queen's will...
36052,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I must eliminate that lowly human girl!
36053,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,She's gone!
36054,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Where is she?
36055,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!
36056,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I've seen you once before.
36057,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Before I was placed in the cocoon.
36058,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"So I can see you, no matter where you are."
36059,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Wink Blue: Lonesome Deep Sea Fish
36060,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What?
36061,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,What just attacked my clone?
36062,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It came from nowhere.
36063,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"Pouf, what is that?"
36064,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,I don't know.
36065,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,It seems to have resulted from the \Nremaining enemies attacking my clone.
36066,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,We must hurry.
36067,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The King!
36068,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,The King is alive.
36069,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Next time:
36070,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.
36071,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"You know how people say ""like"" all the time?"
36072,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Sure.
36073,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,"So wouldn't it be a, like, ""Formidable-like \NEnemy x And x Clear-like Objective""-like thing?"
36074,Unparalleled Joy x And x Unconditional Love.,128,Uh...
36075,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"The revived King, now calling himself Meruem, carried Pouf and Youpi back to the palace in order to recover his memories."
36076,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Pouf's main body is with the King!
36077,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They're heading toward the palace \Nat an alarming speed.
36078,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That probably means the chairman lost.
36079,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What can the rest of us do?
36080,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective
36081,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What's happening?
36082,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Where is the Supreme Leader?
36083,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It won't stop following us.
36084,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That's annoying.
36085,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It's the enemy's power.
36086,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I believe it won't disappear until we've damaged the enemy's physical body.
36087,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Ah, how interesting."
36088,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I shall test it.
36089,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Incredible, that's my..."
36090,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I understand.
36091,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,My power was not meant for me.
36092,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It was meant to be used by the King!
36093,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Youpi.
36094,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,This does not make sense.
36095,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If you knew this power resulted \Nfrom an enemy's attack, that means either you saw it used, or it was used on you."
36096,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Which was it?
36097,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I was hit by an attack.
36098,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I cannot see it following you now.
36099,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,So why does the enemy still live?
36100,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,How did you free yourself \Nfrom the enemy's power?
36101,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Answer me.
36102,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,We made an agreement.
36103,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"In exchange for releasing me from his power,"
36104,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I agreed to spare his comrade.
36105,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Then, after he released you, you had the opportunity to finish \Nhim off along with his comrade."
36106,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Why did you not do so?
36107,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Honestly, I'm not sure."
36108,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"I believe I felt that, if I had, \NI would have lost in some way."
36109,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"I felt that breaking a promise, even a promise to an enemy, would be equivalent to conceding defeat."
36110,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Impossible!
36111,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You're saying that your personal emotions were the reason you spared the lives \Nof those who oppose the King?
36112,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'm prepared to accept any punishment...
36113,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I have no excuses to offer.
36114,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I only ordered that you not lie to me.
36115,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I have no reason to punish \Nthose who speak the truth.
36116,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Pouf.
36117,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Yes!
36118,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Youpi.
36119,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Yes!
36120,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.
36121,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Our bodies and souls have been linked...
36122,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It is no longer possible for the three of \Nus to hide anything from one another!
36123,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your Majesty!
36124,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your Majesty...
36125,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Let us go.
36126,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Yes!
36127,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your Majesty...
36128,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Was that meant as a final warning because you realize what I plan to do, \Nand the guilt it makes me feel?"
36129,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Nevertheless!
36130,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Even if it means I am executed for my crime...
36131,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I do this for the King!
36132,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Where is she? Find her!
36133,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Hurry up and find her!
36134,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,For the sake of our species!
36135,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Where is she?
36136,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Find her!
36137,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,She is not necessary!
36138,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Find her, quickly!"
36139,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I do this for the King.
36140,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Is she over there?
36141,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Wait! Not there!
36142,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,No! That way!
36143,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Hey!
36144,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"When you're split up, you can't hurt me."
36145,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You're ignoring me?
36146,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Wait up!
36147,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You can't remove APR without defeating me!
36148,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me."
36149,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Does the enemy who attached this also have the ability to teleport?
36150,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That's someone else...
36151,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,There's one who can make himself \Nand those around him invisible.
36152,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He looks like a chameleon.
36153,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"I don't know his name, but he's \None of the Squadron Leaders."
36154,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Which means he's a traitor!
36155,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"So you spared not only humans, \Nbut a traitor, as well?"
36156,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'm willing to accept any punishment.
36157,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your Majesty!
36158,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Until we've defeated them, please..."
36159,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I do not care. It is irrelevant.
36160,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve."
36161,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Youpi...
36162,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"We must accept your emotional instability, as well as the traitor's betrayal, as we move forward."
36163,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Humans are a sacrifice meant to help \Nus attain the next level of evolution.
36164,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The perfect sacrifice.
36165,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution, any lingering traces of the human ego will be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait."
36166,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The King's opinion had completely \Nreversed following the explosion.
36167,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Was it due to the impact?
36168,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,No.
36169,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"This was the King, as well."
36170,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If the enemy can become invisible,"
36171,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can find him by making contact.
36172,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"I need to split myself into the smallest clones \Nthat can still retain sight, and expand the search!"
36173,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Bastard...
36174,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Clearly, I'm not his target."
36175,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He turned back just like that... Who is he after?
36176,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?"
36177,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"That's bad, then!"
36178,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can't think of any way to defeat the \NKing without Meleoron's ability...
36179,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I must protect Meleoron at any cost!
36180,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Pouf divided his clones to the point where \Nthey're too small for me to see.
36181,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Unlike his main body, his clones have to be at full size for me to see them."
36182,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The man with the pompadour \Nwas obviously just a decoy.
36183,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They must know we've realized \Nthat the chameleon is a traitor.
36184,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"In other words, they believe that I've \Nreturned to dispose of the traitor."
36185,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Assuming the chameleon is concealing \Nhimself and the others as they flee, and that the woman is among them, if I get close, they will protect the \Nchameleon and abandon her!"
36186,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Because they believe the \Nchameleon is my target.
36187,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They must have never imagined that I'd return to kill the woman that Pitou was \Ntrying so desperately to heal.
36188,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If they believe I've returned to rescue \Nthe woman, it's even better!"
36189,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They may even offer to hand her \Nover to me with conditions.
36190,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He must be after Meleoron.
36191,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor."
36192,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Hold on.
36193,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Let's make sure.
36194,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The door leading underground?
36195,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,So that's it...
36196,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"They realized that I know they \Ncan become invisible, and decided to give me two options."
36197,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The chameleon either ran inside \Nor fled somewhere else.
36198,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Their plan is to split up my clones \Nfurther, to weaken me."
36199,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,No! Over there! Over there!
36200,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Over there! Over there! Over there!
36201,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What?
36202,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They're giving me two options.
36203,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?
36204,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Then they want to know which is my target?
36205,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?"
36206,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Or do I send the majority of them after \Nthe chameleon, to fool them?"
36207,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Even if the shutter is closed,"
36208,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.
36209,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"No, I don't have time for that!"
36210,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'll go after the woman!
36211,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,So she's his target?
36212,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I only have to kill the woman and hide her body from the \NKing for a short time.
36213,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,My clone can manage that!
36214,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I only need a minute or two!
36215,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He's... incredibly fast!
36216,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Then she's your target?
36217,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'm up for a game of tag.
36218,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can go all night.
36219,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Judging by how quickly he reacted, it would be hard to catch him, \Neven at full strength."
36220,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If I don't hurry, the King will arrive."
36221,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What do I do?
36222,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution."
36223,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I know!
36224,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The greatest magic of all...
36225,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He split himself up?
36226,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,But he won't be big enough to take her away!
36227,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Is he going to attack me first?
36228,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your plan is going to backfire...
36229,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"You've reduced your speed and power, so I don't even need to use Godspeed."
36230,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Cease this futile resistance.
36231,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your plans have already been thwarted!
36232,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What is the point in adding \Nto your transgressions?
36233,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If it is fear of retribution driving \Nyou to flee, you needn't worry."
36234,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The King will forgive you.
36235,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He is a benevolent ruler.
36236,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Don't make me laugh!
36237,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You think I'll believe that?
36238,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"You'll probably tie me to a tree, \Nand turn me into a soldier!"
36239,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The King?
36240,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That's right...
36241,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Keep running.
36242,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Take her far from the King first!
36243,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That confirms it...
36244,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"I don't know the reason, but this girl is important to the King."
36245,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,For Gon... For the sake of our mission...
36246,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can't let the enemy have her!
36247,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That's right...
36248,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The person chasing us sounded like one of the people with the Supreme Leader...
36249,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?
36250,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Then who is this person?
36251,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Who are the people he was with?
36252,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Your twisted sense of justice \Nwill never help the people!
36253,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"First, I cast a spell on the woman."
36254,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I use magic words to make her suspicious...
36255,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The King and I seek open dialogue.
36256,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Now, release her at once!"
36257,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.
36258,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What is he up to?
36259,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Let me go...
36260,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Please put me down!
36261,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Something's wrong with you!
36262,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You're all tingly!
36263,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"What are you talking about, fool?"
36264,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'm trying to save you!
36265,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You're lying!
36266,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'm lying?
36267,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,You trust that insect more than you trust me?
36268,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Insect?
36269,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What are you talking about?!
36270,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That's right... She can't see!
36271,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Let go! Let me go!
36272,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That'll make it hard to explain.
36273,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Damn... Almost.
36274,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.
36275,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If the woman you're carrying resists, \Nyour speed will also fall..."
36276,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What's going on?
36277,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He wasn't aiming for me...
36278,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He was aiming for the woman.
36279,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He was trying to kill her!
36280,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If she escapes, that's fine."
36281,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If she distracts him with her resistance, allowing me to kill her, even better!"
36282,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Komugi-san!
36283,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.
36284,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They will not kill you...
36285,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Keep struggling!
36286,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Keep fighting back!
36287,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'll save you soon!
36288,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"She was knocked out, so that's impossible."
36289,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Well, I have no idea what's going on here, but I know that you're making me mad."
36290,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If you enter this ring,"
36291,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I'll kill you.
36292,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"You may be a clone, but you were formed from the original's cells."
36293,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"If I burn those cells, they die."
36294,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Electricity...
36295,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Come on... I'll whittle you down.
36296,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Are you having difficulty?
36297,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I can feel your impatience.
36298,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I shall lend you a hand.
36299,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It's nothing you need to worry about.
36300,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Your first priority should be regaining \Nyour memories, Meruem-sama."
36301,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Once my main body has returned, \NI can deal with the intruders easily."
36302,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!"
36303,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Humans, as far as we can see!"
36304,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Do you remember now?
36305,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They are all here for you...
36306,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They all belong to you!
36307,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They belong to me?
36308,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures, and stand atop the food chain."
36309,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That is your glorious destiny!
36310,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,As willed by the heavens!
36311,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Something isn't right...
36312,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,There's still something else...
36313,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Something else I've forgotten.
36314,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What are you saying?
36315,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Nothing could be more important \Nthan ruling over all life forms...
36316,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I suppose.
36317,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.
36318,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,However...
36319,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The pain won't cease.
36320,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Why is the palace in shambles?
36321,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It was destroyed in the battle.
36322,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It happened after you left the palace.
36323,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Where is the place I spent most of my time in?
36324,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,It has been completely destroyed...
36325,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I suppose I should look at what's left.
36326,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Yes, you may find something that will \Nhelp you regain your memories..."
36327,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,This is bad!
36328,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,That could be it...
36329,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,The Gungi board and pieces!
36330,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,They may be the key to awakening his memory!
36331,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,I must dispose of them!
36332,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,He gave up?
36333,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Over there.
36334,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Let's go.
36335,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Next time: Magic x Of x Despair.
36336,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Killua, thanks."
36337,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,What's this about?
36338,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"We're buddies, right?"
36339,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,"Yeah, but still..."
36340,Formidable Enemy x And x Clear Objective.,129,Thanks.
36341,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Damn... Almost.
36342,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.
36343,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What's going on?
36344,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He wasn't aiming for me...
36345,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He was aiming for the woman.
36346,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He was trying to kill her!
36347,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Magic x Of x Despair
36348,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He's back.
36349,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,The King has returned.
36350,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Hey, aren't we too close?"
36351,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It's okay...
36352,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.
36353,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,The problem will be when \Nthe King and Pouf split up.
36354,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Should I remove APR from Pouf, \Nand use it on the King?"
36355,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,These are known as human grapes.
36356,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,The humans fit to become \Nsoldiers wait here to hatch.
36357,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry!
36358,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry!
36359,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
36360,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!
36361,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,There it is.
36362,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hide it fast.
36363,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry! Hurry!
36364,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Faster! Faster!
36365,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Faster! Faster!
36366,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry! Hurry!
36367,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster!
36368,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hurry! Hurry!
36369,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,We must also hurry!
36370,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Where is Welfin?
36371,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,These won't work.
36372,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"When the bodies are ripped apart, \NI can't use Living Dead Dolls."
36373,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Killua...
36374,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!
36375,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Yeah.
36376,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"We should circle around, following the wall, and hide in the crowd."
36377,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Okay.
36378,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What about Gon and Pitou?
36379,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,They just entered the Peijing hiding place.
36380,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,They're walking down a hallway.
36381,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,How does that crystal work now?
36382,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,You can also see Pouf and me in it?
36383,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Yes, looking from a bit above."
36384,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Wink Blue uses my crystal ball to remember people seen through my right eye.
36385,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Looking through only my left eye,"
36386,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I can watch those people's current \Npositions in the crystal ball.
36387,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"At the moment, the crystal ball \Nis simultaneously showing"
36388,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Gon and Pitou, Killua and me, as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi."
36389,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It's like watching a TV screen \Nthat's been split up.
36390,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"However, my right eye has only \Nseen Pouf, you, and Gon."
36391,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,So I can only see the others when \Nthey're around one of you.
36392,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,And I can only use my power to \Nwatch three people at once.
36393,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"If I see someone else with my right eye,"
36394,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"I won't be able to see the oldest \Nof the three targets, Pouf."
36395,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.
36396,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"If you can only see his main body, \Nand his clones are scattered, it's probably more a minus than a plus."
36397,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Is that so?
36398,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"If I can only see his main body, that also means I won't be fooled by clones."
36399,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"And if his main body is only the size \Nof a fly, I can literally crush him."
36400,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.
36401,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What greater plus is there?
36402,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,So they figured me out.
36403,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Then I just need to use that against them.
36404,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Walk forward.
36405,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"It's the right door, at the end."
36406,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,"
36407,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Pitou's hearing was sharp \Nenough to pick up the voice on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.
36408,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Pitou-sama, this is Welfin."
36409,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I will keep this as brief as I can.
36410,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Brovada and I have retaken the girl.
36411,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Intruders are still around, so we're taking refuge beneath the palace."
36412,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I will let you hear her voice.
36413,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hello? Pitou-sama?
36414,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,This is Komugi.
36415,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"I'm fine, so don't worry."
36416,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Got it...
36417,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Goodbye.
36418,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Was that good?
36419,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Yes.
36420,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"If possible, can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?"
36421,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"It's him, right?"
36422,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Since I can split myself at the cellular level,"
36423,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I can also become different people.
36424,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices."
36425,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Now, Pitou is also under my spell..."
36426,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,The spell of the lie that will \Nfree Pitou from that curse.
36427,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"So, keep watching Gon and Pitou."
36428,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,You should see something interesting soon...
36429,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Now, heal Kite, like you promised."
36430,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Once that's done, I'll release her."
36431,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Your name...
36432,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What is your name?
36433,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Gon.
36434,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Gon Freecss.
36435,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Gon...
36436,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,You listened to my request.
36437,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,So I will be honest with you.
36438,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He is already dead.
36439,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Dead?
36440,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He died during our fight.
36441,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I remember now.
36442,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Back then, you were..."
36443,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I was unable to revive one who was dead.
36444,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"My power could only prevent the body from decomposing, and control its movements."
36445,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,His soul is no longer here.
36446,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,There is no way to heal him.
36447,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I am sorry.
36448,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Palm...
36449,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Yes?
36450,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Thank you.
36451,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What? What's this?
36452,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What are you thanking me for?
36453,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Stuff...
36454,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Stuff? Such as?
36455,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!
36456,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What was that?
36457,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It seems wrong to make me mad \Nwhile you're thanking me!
36458,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.
36459,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Because now we're friends.
36460,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I never say thanks to my friends.
36461,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Anyway, how's Gon?"
36462,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Y-Yes, that's right..."
36463,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What's wrong?
36464,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It can't be...
36465,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What's going on?!
36466,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite...
36467,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is... dead.
36468,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Man, forced to take another life..."
36469,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"You've grown, Gon."
36470,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,If I...
36471,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,If I...
36472,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Whether we win or lose, hell lies ahead of us."
36473,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,If I hadn't gone with him...
36474,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite wouldn't have died.
36475,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It was...
36476,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It was my fault.
36477,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It was because I tagged along...
36478,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It was really my fault...
36479,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Get away from me!
36480,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It's my fault that Kite is...
36481,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,No... It isn't my fault!
36482,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Pitou's the one who killed him!
36483,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Not me!
36484,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But it was me...
36485,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It was me....
36486,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I killed Kite.
36487,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It's my fault...
36488,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,No! It's Pitou's fault!
36489,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But it's really my fault.
36490,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is alive!
36491,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
36492,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is dead...
36493,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is dead.
36494,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is dead.
36495,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is dead...
36496,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is dead!
36497,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Help...
36498,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Someone help...
36499,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is... Kite is...
36500,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is... Kite is...
36501,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite...
36502,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Just wait a little longer.
36503,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I'll get you back to normal soon.
36504,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I can't get him back to normal.
36505,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite is gone...
36506,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,It's my fault.
36507,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Someone help...
36508,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Someone help Kite—
36509,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,No! No! No! No! No!
36510,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But... But...
36511,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But...
36512,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But... But... But... But...
36513,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But...
36514,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Doctor Blythe.
36515,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What?
36516,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Pitou's going to help Kite?
36517,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Oh, it's true..."
36518,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Kite being dead was a lie.
36519,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Pitou will heal him.
36520,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Huh?
36521,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Why is it healing Pitou's arm?
36522,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Turn Kite back to normal.
36523,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Please...
36524,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,After you finish what you're doing.
36525,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Why? What's going on?!
36526,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"What's wrong? What happened, Palm?"
36527,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I don't know...
36528,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I can only see what's happening...
36529,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,But something is wrong with Gon!
36530,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,What's wrong?!
36531,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"Pitou is healing itself, not Kite."
36532,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.
36533,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Impossible...
36534,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"As long as she's in our hands, Pitou..."
36535,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Pitou has to obey us!
36536,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Please...
36537,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Help Kite.
36538,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Next time: Anger x And x Light.
36539,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Hold on until I get there!
36540,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,I don't care if this is the end...
36541,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,"I'll kill you, Pitou!"
36542,Magic x Of x Despair.,130,Gon!
36543,Anger x And x Light.,131,Hello? Pitou-sama?
36544,Anger x And x Light.,131,This is Komugi.
36545,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I'm fine, so don't worry."
36546,Anger x And x Light.,131,Got it...
36547,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Now, Pitou is also under my spell..."
36548,Anger x And x Light.,131,The spell of the lie that will \Nfree Pitou from that curse.
36549,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon...
36550,Anger x And x Light.,131,You listened to my request.
36551,Anger x And x Light.,131,So I will be honest with you.
36552,Anger x And x Light.,131,He is already dead.
36553,Anger x And x Light.,131,His soul is no longer here.
36554,Anger x And x Light.,131,There is no way to heal him.
36555,Anger x And x Light.,131,I am sorry.
36556,Anger x And x Light.,131,Huh?
36557,Anger x And x Light.,131,Why is it healing Pitou's arm?
36558,Anger x And x Light.,131,Turn Kite back to normal.
36559,Anger x And x Light.,131,Please...
36560,Anger x And x Light.,131,After you finish what you're doing...
36561,Anger x And x Light.,131,Anger x And x Light
36562,Anger x And x Light.,131,The tables have been turned.
36563,Anger x And x Light.,131,Pitou believes we have recovered Komugi.
36564,Anger x And x Light.,131,"The way things are looking, \Nthat Gon boy will be killed."
36565,Anger x And x Light.,131,I am the only one who can stop Pitou.
36566,Anger x And x Light.,131,"If you hand the woman over \Nto me, I will stop Pitou..."
36567,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Get lost, scumbag!"
36568,Anger x And x Light.,131,Leave her to me.
36569,Anger x And x Light.,131,I swear upon these eyes that \NI will not let them have her.
36570,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Yeah, I'm counting on you."
36571,Anger x And x Light.,131,Speed of Lightning!
36572,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon...
36573,Anger x And x Light.,131,Wait for me to get there!
36574,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon...
36575,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I'm sorry to say this, but I must kill you."
36576,Anger x And x Light.,131,For the King.
36577,Anger x And x Light.,131,You must kill me?
36578,Anger x And x Light.,131,You aren't going to heal him?
36579,Anger x And x Light.,131,Then you really aren't going to heal Kite...
36580,Anger x And x Light.,131,Liar.
36581,Anger x And x Light.,131,What?
36582,Anger x And x Light.,131,What is this?
36583,Anger x And x Light.,131,I don't care if this is the end...
36584,Anger x And x Light.,131,So...
36585,Anger x And x Light.,131,I'll use everything.
36586,Anger x And x Light.,131,I was right.
36587,Anger x And x Light.,131,His power is now equal to that of the King!
36588,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I'll kill you,"
36589,Anger x And x Light.,131,Pitou!
36590,Anger x And x Light.,131,Terpsichora!
36591,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Exceed your limits, and dance!"
36592,Anger x And x Light.,131,I must stop him here!
36593,Anger x And x Light.,131,It can't be!
36594,Anger x And x Light.,131,Is he heading for the King?
36595,Anger x And x Light.,131,Come.
36596,Anger x And x Light.,131,I don't want to destroy this place.
36597,Anger x And x Light.,131,This way.
36598,Anger x And x Light.,131,Follow me.
36599,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I don't know how he did it, but he's forced his body to mature to a point at which he's able to defeat me."
36600,Anger x And x Light.,131,First comes rock...
36601,Anger x And x Light.,131,Rock.
36602,Anger x And x Light.,131,Paper.
36603,Anger x And x Light.,131,Rock.
36604,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,"
36605,Anger x And x Light.,131,Pitou felt a sense of relief.
36606,Anger x And x Light.,131,Thank goodness...
36607,Anger x And x Light.,131,This power could only be achieved through \Nthe sacrifice of his own life energy.
36608,Anger x And x Light.,131,He's prepared to never use{\i0
36609,Anger x And x Light.,131,That was the resolve required \Nto perform this feat.
36610,Anger x And x Light.,131,An enemy blessed with immense talent has been forced to exchange all \Nof that talent for this power.
36611,Anger x And x Light.,131,I'm so glad
36612,Anger x And x Light.,131,I am the one that he will kill...
36613,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Having used Speed of Lightning to race \Nto Gon, Killua arrived to hear..."
36614,Anger x And x Light.,131,Which one of them is doing that?
36615,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon!
36616,Anger x And x Light.,131,And what he found was...
36617,Anger x And x Light.,131,"A silhouette that looked nothing \Nlike the person he'd known, swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches, downward toward the skull \Nof an already-broken Pitou..."
36618,Anger x And x Light.,131,Rock.
36619,Anger x And x Light.,131,Paper.
36620,Anger x And x Light.,131,"...for the final, shattering blow."
36621,Anger x And x Light.,131,Kite...
36622,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I finished the job, the way you taught me to."
36623,Anger x And x Light.,131,So...
36624,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Gon, is that you?"
36625,Anger x And x Light.,131,Killua...
36626,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Having seen Gon's appearance, \NKillua immediately thought of Bisky."
36627,Anger x And x Light.,131,But he realized the difference at once.
36628,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Bisky's appearance changed, but there wasn't a massive increase \Nin the aura contained within her."
36629,Anger x And x Light.,131,"And in Bisky's case, she was merely reverting to her original form."
36630,Anger x And x Light.,131,But Gon's done the opposite!
36631,Anger x And x Light.,131,How many years?
36632,Anger x And x Light.,131,More than ten?
36633,Anger x And x Light.,131,Decades?
36634,Anger x And x Light.,131,This would have been the result \Nof years of endless training.
36635,Anger x And x Light.,131,What price did he have to pay \Nto obtain so much aura?
36636,Anger x And x Light.,131,Pitou's devotion to the King was so great
36637,Anger x And x Light.,131,"Nen{\i0 transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet \Nready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey, its sole purpose to kill Gon."
36638,Anger x And x Light.,131,"In that fraction of a second, \Nshorter than the blink of an eye,"
36639,Anger x And x Light.,131,Killua heard Gon speak.
36640,Anger x And x Light.,131,It's okay.
36641,Anger x And x Light.,131,It doesn't hurt.
36642,Anger x And x Light.,131,I'm not trying to be tough.
36643,Anger x And x Light.,131,I'm kind of happy...
36644,Anger x And x Light.,131,I finally get to be the same as Kite was then.
36645,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon...
36646,Anger x And x Light.,131,I feel like
36647,Anger x And x Light.,131,I've been redeemed some.
36648,Anger x And x Light.,131,You can have my right arm.
36649,Anger x And x Light.,131,First comes rock...
36650,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon!
36651,Anger x And x Light.,131,"It's time for you to sleep, too."
36652,Anger x And x Light.,131,Stop...
36653,Anger x And x Light.,131,You can't!
36654,Anger x And x Light.,131,"If you keep using this power, what will happen to you?"
36655,Anger x And x Light.,131,Rock.
36656,Anger x And x Light.,131,Paper.
36657,Anger x And x Light.,131,Gon!
36658,Anger x And x Light.,131,Next time: Flash x And x Start.
36659,Anger x And x Light.,131,"I never got a chance to say this, but thank you..."
36660,Anger x And x Light.,131,For everything.
36661,Flash x And x Start.,132,"As Gon was dedicating all of his \Npower to finishing off Neferpitou,"
36662,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were inside the west tower, where Komugi had been."
36663,Flash x And x Start.,132,Once we're through here...
36664,Flash x And x Start.,132,The west tower's second floor.
36665,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Once we've passed this area, the King will never remember her!"
36666,Flash x And x Start.,132,As long as I don't give him \Nan opportunity to see her...
36667,Flash x And x Start.,132,Flash x And x Start
36668,Flash x And x Start.,132,Something is missing...
36669,Flash x And x Start.,132,But what is it?
36670,Flash x And x Start.,132,I don't know.
36671,Flash x And x Start.,132,I know...
36672,Flash x And x Start.,132,I won't say anything.
36673,Flash x And x Start.,132,I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.
36674,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Ideally, he should stay as he is now."
36675,Flash x And x Start.,132,I have a feeling that something is \Nmissing from this place.
36676,Flash x And x Start.,132,Though it may just be a side \Neffect of my memory loss.
36677,Flash x And x Start.,132,Exactly...
36678,Flash x And x Start.,132,Your memory can be verified \Nthrough what you see.
36679,Flash x And x Start.,132,Which means you can recover all \Nof the memories you need.
36680,Flash x And x Start.,132,I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.
36681,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes.
36682,Flash x And x Start.,132,"However, that can be moved up."
36683,Flash x And x Start.,132,"By 9:00, the remaining humans will be gathered \Nin the plain before the palace."
36684,Flash x And x Start.,132,What is it?
36685,Flash x And x Start.,132,I have not used my scales on the humans still on their way in.
36686,Flash x And x Start.,132,"We don't want them to cause a commotion, so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them."
36687,Flash x And x Start.,132,"What will you do, Youpi?"
36688,Flash x And x Start.,132,Right...
36689,Flash x And x Start.,132,I'll look for Pitou.
36690,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Right now, I don't have the \Nstrength to protect you."
36691,Flash x And x Start.,132,Pitou...
36692,Flash x And x Start.,132,Did you just remember something?
36693,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Oh, yeah... We haven't told \Nthe King about Pitou yet."
36694,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?"
36695,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Yes, one of my three Royal Guards."
36696,Flash x And x Start.,132,"I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly, it seems a mystery that I \Ndidn't remember it until now."
36697,Flash x And x Start.,132,"So words can also trigger his memory, not just images..."
36698,Flash x And x Start.,132,We cannot let him hear her name.
36699,Flash x And x Start.,132,We must be very careful...
36700,Flash x And x Start.,132,The key will be convincing Pitou.
36701,Flash x And x Start.,132,I know...
36702,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?"
36703,Flash x And x Start.,132,There it is again...
36704,Flash x And x Start.,132,I'm counting on you.
36705,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes...
36706,Flash x And x Start.,132,I... asked Pitou to do something for me.
36707,Flash x And x Start.,132,Youpi.
36708,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes...
36709,Flash x And x Start.,132,Bring Pitou to me at once.
36710,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes.
36711,Flash x And x Start.,132,"What will you do, Meruem-sama?"
36712,Flash x And x Start.,132,Enemies are still around.
36713,Flash x And x Start.,132,Indeed...
36714,Flash x And x Start.,132,"As I search for Pitou myself,"
36715,Flash x And x Start.,132,I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.
36716,Flash x And x Start.,132,This is bad!
36717,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Your Majesty, that would be..."
36718,Flash x And x Start.,132,It is merely for entertainment.
36719,Flash x And x Start.,132,And I am sure these enemies \Nhave useful information.
36720,Flash x And x Start.,132,"However, we won't be at your side, and we don't know what enemies remain—"
36721,Flash x And x Start.,132,"I want an honest answer,"
36722,Flash x And x Start.,132,Pouf.
36723,Flash x And x Start.,132,Do you believe there is a chance that these intruders could get the better of me?!
36724,Flash x And x Start.,132,No...
36725,Flash x And x Start.,132,Absolutely not.
36726,Flash x And x Start.,132,Th-This exceeds my expectations...
36727,Flash x And x Start.,132,The King...
36728,Flash x And x Start.,132,Meruem-sama... is the ultimate being.
36729,Flash x And x Start.,132,That much is certain!
36730,Flash x And x Start.,132,"The overwhelming aura left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed, in total despair."
36731,Flash x And x Start.,132,Th-This isn't something we can deal with...
36732,Flash x And x Start.,132,"To handle this, you'd need an entire \Nnation's military might."
36733,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Meleoron, we're making a run for it!"
36734,Flash x And x Start.,132,Seriously?
36735,Flash x And x Start.,132,You bet!
36736,Flash x And x Start.,132,We'll head back to Peijing under \Nthe cover of this crowd!
36737,Flash x And x Start.,132,"What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?"
36738,Flash x And x Start.,132,There's nothing we can do!
36739,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If they can see that, they'll understand."
36740,Flash x And x Start.,132,"They'll run away, too."
36741,Flash x And x Start.,132,That's the only option.
36742,Flash x And x Start.,132,That isn't... something we can handle.
36743,Flash x And x Start.,132,But if you and I team up...
36744,Flash x And x Start.,132,"We could land one attack, sure."
36745,Flash x And x Start.,132,And we could probably attach APR.
36746,Flash x And x Start.,132,But...
36747,Flash x And x Start.,132,APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!
36748,Flash x And x Start.,132,If we're within fifty meters of him...
36749,Flash x And x Start.,132,Do you think we'd last long \Nenough for him to go bust?
36750,Flash x And x Start.,132,You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!
36751,Flash x And x Start.,132,The situation's changed...
36752,Flash x And x Start.,132,The enemy knows about our powers!
36753,Flash x And x Start.,132,They can prepare for us.
36754,Flash x And x Start.,132,I was an idiot.
36755,Flash x And x Start.,132,"We needed to notify the Association \Nright away of the chairman's defeat, so they could immediately initiate \Nthe next plan of action."
36756,Flash x And x Start.,132,Hurry!
36757,Flash x And x Start.,132,Revenge and duty...
36758,Flash x And x Start.,132,The difference in motivations \Nbetween Meleoron and Knuckle placed growing distance between \Nthem as they walked.
36759,Flash x And x Start.,132,At that moment...
36760,Flash x And x Start.,132,En{\i0
36761,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Sensing there were two enemies nearby, \Nhe began with Knuckle."
36762,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought that he should activate his power \Nwhen he was knocked out."
36763,Flash x And x Start.,132,Where's the King?
36764,Flash x And x Start.,132,It disappeared!
36765,Flash x And x Start.,132,I shall be interrogating them.
36766,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Once I am done, do as you like."
36767,Flash x And x Start.,132,Nen{\i0
36768,Flash x And x Start.,132,En{\i0
36769,Flash x And x Start.,132,One of them must be carrying \Nthe unconscious Komugi.
36770,Flash x And x Start.,132,What do I do? What do I do?
36771,Flash x And x Start.,132,I must stop the King...
36772,Flash x And x Start.,132,Your Majesty!
36773,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If your purpose is entertainment, \Nshouldn't you take your time?"
36774,Flash x And x Start.,132,It appears that you have a proposal.
36775,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes... Would you be willing to engage in a contest with us?
36776,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest?
36777,Flash x And x Start.,132,Again...
36778,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36779,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36780,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36781,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36782,Flash x And x Start.,132,What contest?
36783,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Youpi and I will search for Pitou,"
36784,Flash x And x Start.,132,Nen{\i0
36785,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest to see who locates their target first?
36786,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes.
36787,Flash x And x Start.,132,But don't you need to go and spread scales?
36788,Flash x And x Start.,132,Correct.
36789,Flash x And x Start.,132,"So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,"
36790,Flash x And x Start.,132,I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.
36791,Flash x And x Start.,132,It is very clear that the difference in power between you \Nand the intruders is insurmountable.
36792,Flash x And x Start.,132,Finding and capturing them should \Nonly take you a few seconds.
36793,Flash x And x Start.,132,That cannot be called entertainment.
36794,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Meanwhile, we must find Pitou, who has engaged an enemy that \Nseems capable of teleportation."
36795,Flash x And x Start.,132,And Pitou's current location is unknown.
36796,Flash x And x Start.,132,"To make up for the difference, we request additional time, \Nas well as one further handicap."
36797,Flash x And x Start.,132,One further handicap?
36798,Flash x And x Start.,132,What is it?
36799,Flash x And x Start.,132,En{\i0
36800,Flash x And x Start.,132,How does that sound?
36801,Flash x And x Start.,132,Amusing.
36802,Flash x And x Start.,132,I accept this contest.
36803,Flash x And x Start.,132,Thank you very much.
36804,Flash x And x Start.,132,Perfect...
36805,Flash x And x Start.,132,I can use the extra time to kill that woman!
36806,Flash x And x Start.,132,"As long as we are playing, \NI have a proposal, as well."
36807,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish."
36808,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Yes, sir."
36809,Flash x And x Start.,132,We are very honored.
36810,Flash x And x Start.,132,"And what if you win, Meruem-sama?"
36811,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If I win, you will tell me what you are hiding from me."
36812,Flash x And x Start.,132,Your Majesty...
36813,Flash x And x Start.,132,Silence.
36814,Flash x And x Start.,132,I already told you...
36815,Flash x And x Start.,132,You and I are united as one.
36816,Flash x And x Start.,132,Did you think that I could not sense \Nthe guilt that you now feel?
36817,Flash x And x Start.,132,"However, I sense that your feelings \Nof loyalty are stronger."
36818,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Otherwise, I would have sent \Nyour heads flying long ago."
36819,Flash x And x Start.,132,I am certain you have your reasons.
36820,Flash x And x Start.,132,I shall not ask them...
36821,Flash x And x Start.,132,Assuming that you beat me.
36822,Flash x And x Start.,132,"You will obtain what you desire, \Nand protect your secret."
36823,Flash x And x Start.,132,You could not wish for better terms...
36824,Flash x And x Start.,132,Assuming that you beat me.
36825,Flash x And x Start.,132,Meruem-sama...
36826,Flash x And x Start.,132,"I shall immediately begin to spread \Nscales, and not waste a moment."
36827,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If we lose, we will tell you everything."
36828,Flash x And x Start.,132,I swear it on my life.
36829,Flash x And x Start.,132,You do not appear to be treating \Nthis as mere entertainment.
36830,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Once Pouf finishes spreading his \Nscales and returns, I shall begin."
36831,Flash x And x Start.,132,Is that acceptable?
36832,Flash x And x Start.,132,Yes.
36833,Flash x And x Start.,132,Victory goes to whomever returns to \Nthis room with their target first.
36834,Flash x And x Start.,132,"If Pitou should return, you are to explain the objective of this contest and order Pitou to hide."
36835,Flash x And x Start.,132,As you wish.
36836,Flash x And x Start.,132,I shall tell you that
36837,Flash x And x Start.,132,Nen{\i0 were an octopus and a human \Ncarrying some sort of burden.
36838,Flash x And x Start.,132,I must win.
36839,Flash x And x Start.,132,"No, victory is already assured!"
36840,Flash x And x Start.,132,The question is what to do \Nabout Pitou and the woman.
36841,Flash x And x Start.,132,Then...
36842,Flash x And x Start.,132,Start!
36843,Flash x And x Start.,132,Where do you think Pitou went?
36844,Flash x And x Start.,132,It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!
36845,Flash x And x Start.,132,Turn around and wait by the west \Ntower for Pitou's return.
36846,Flash x And x Start.,132,Do not allow Pitou near the King!
36847,Flash x And x Start.,132,"You can't use clones while you \Nspread your scales, right?"
36848,Flash x And x Start.,132,Then you aren't buying us any time.
36849,Flash x And x Start.,132,Trust me!
36850,Flash x And x Start.,132,I'm begging you!
36851,Flash x And x Start.,132,Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...
36852,Flash x And x Start.,132,Those two are dead.
36853,Flash x And x Start.,132,"No, they're still alive."
36854,Flash x And x Start.,132,They were only knocked unconscious...
36855,Flash x And x Start.,132,Where's Gon?
36856,Flash x And x Start.,132,Killua's carrying him...
36857,Flash x And x Start.,132,His hair is long?
36858,Flash x And x Start.,132,Is it someone else?
36859,Flash x And x Start.,132,"No, those are the only two \Nfigures in my crystal ball."
36860,Flash x And x Start.,132,That is Gon!
36861,Flash x And x Start.,132,Something must have happened \Nwhen I wasn't watching.
36862,Flash x And x Start.,132,Where's Pitou?
36863,Flash x And x Start.,132,"In any case, don't come back here... Please!"
36864,Flash x And x Start.,132,Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...
36865,Flash x And x Start.,132,Are they poisonous?
36866,Flash x And x Start.,132,It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.
36867,Flash x And x Start.,132,"In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side."
36868,Flash x And x Start.,132,I must get as far from my \Nprevious location as I can...
36869,Flash x And x Start.,132," En {\i1 and the King appeared next to Pouf, \Ncarrying Knuckle and Meleoron."
36870,Flash x And x Start.,132,Only a few seconds had passed!
36871,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me."
36872,Flash x And x Start.,132,The King could be standing behind \Nme at any moment...
36873,Flash x And x Start.,132,I must hurry and get farther away...
36874,Flash x And x Start.,132, En {\i1
36875,Flash x And x Start.,132,I must go in there!
36876,Flash x And x Start.,132," En, {\i1"
36877,Flash x And x Start.,132, En {\i1
36878,Flash x And x Start.,132,But I'm also trapping myself.
36879,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Should I escape outside the palace, and hope that the King doesn't \Nmake a move for a while?"
36880,Flash x And x Start.,132,There's no reason to expect him not to!
36881,Flash x And x Start.,132,What should I do?
36882,Flash x And x Start.,132,What is the right decision?
36883,Flash x And x Start.,132,Ikalgo!
36884,Flash x And x Start.,132,I thought you might come here...
36885,Flash x And x Start.,132,Let's go in! Hurry!
36886,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Yes, but..."
36887,Flash x And x Start.,132,Hurry!
36888,Flash x And x Start.,132,Isn't that why you came here?
36889,Flash x And x Start.,132,En{\i0
36890,Flash x And x Start.,132,Where's Killua?
36891,Flash x And x Start.,132,He went after Gon.
36892,Flash x And x Start.,132,They're together now.
36893,Flash x And x Start.,132,I don't know what happened to Pitou.
36894,Flash x And x Start.,132,I see...
36895,Flash x And x Start.,132,So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.
36896,Flash x And x Start.,132,The King is on a whole other level.
36897,Flash x And x Start.,132,Why do you think their lives were spared?
36898,Flash x And x Start.,132,"Um, well..."
36899,Flash x And x Start.,132,It's possible that I just want \Nto think that they're alive...
36900,Flash x And x Start.,132,They're alive.
36901,Flash x And x Start.,132,Probably so they can be exchanged.
36902,Flash x And x Start.,132,You mean the way Killua discussed \Nexchanging hostages?
36903,Flash x And x Start.,132,I'll set a trap...
36904,Flash x And x Start.,132,I'm not going out without a fight.
36905,Flash x And x Start.,132,"First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!"
36906,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36907,Flash x And x Start.,132,A contest...
36908,Flash x And x Start.,132,Next time: Deadline x To x Live.
36909,Flash x And x Start.,132,Killua...
36910,Flash x And x Start.,132,Don't you dare speak his name!
36911,Flash x And x Start.,132,You would never understand!
36912,Flash x And x Start.,132,Killua!
36913,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"After challenging Meruem to a \Ncontest in order to buy time,"
36914,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Pouf was now scattering scales on the \Ncitizens who were not yet hypnotized.
36915,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I must hurry or Meruem-sama \Nwill remember that woman...
36916,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We haven't moved forward at all.
36917,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What's going on up ahead?
36918,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Shh, no talking!"
36919,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What are you talking about?
36920,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The soldiers are held up in the back.
36921,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"I heard all their commanders have \Ncollapsed, one after another..."
36922,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Like puppets whose strings have been cut.
36923,Deadline x To x Live.,133,There haven't been any warnings \Nabout stepping out of line anymore.
36924,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I keep hearing loud noises \Ncoming from the palace...
36925,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Something is weird!
36926,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Maybe...
36927,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's a coup d'état?
36928,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"After giving the King 6/7 of my body,"
36929,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I've lost a lot of my power.
36930,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The scales aren't scattering well.
36931,Deadline x To x Live.,133,And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.
36932,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,"
36933,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?
36934,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The boy didn't look to be that strong.
36935,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I cannot use my clones while \NI'm scattering my scales.
36936,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But I need to hurry and kill the woman.
36937,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Whatever it takes...
36938,Deadline x To x Live.,133,This is my final chance!
36939,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Deadline x To x Live
36940,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Palm, take the four women still here with you."
36941,Deadline x To x Live.,133,They didn't run away?
36942,Deadline x To x Live.,133,No.
36943,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Use duct tape to bind their \Nhands and cover their eyes.
36944,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"If they see me, it'll take too long to explain."
36945,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That's true... I understand.
36946,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?"
36947,Deadline x To x Live.,133,A messenger?
36948,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard that the woman is in the underground warehouse.
36949,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.
36950,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Once that's done, you're free."
36951,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"It's probably a trap, right?"
36952,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That's what I'll tell the King.
36953,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me."
36954,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Yeah.
36955,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the \Nenemy's bidding may anger the King.
36956,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I'm not gonna dig my own grave.
36957,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Fine, I'll try it."
36958,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Can you drive?
36959,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Better than you.
36960,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's important that he carries out his mission.
36961,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Perhaps I should keep an eye on him, \Neven if it means losing Pouf..."
36962,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Palm.
36963,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's okay.
36964,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Welfin, once this is over, you're free."
36965,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Go and see Gyro.
36966,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Don't get too cocky!
36967,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I'll kill you!
36968,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Don't you dare speak his name!
36969,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You would never understand!
36970,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"I understand, Zaikahal."
36971,Deadline x To x Live.,133,How...
36972,Deadline x To x Live.,133,How do you know my former...
36973,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I didn't tell anyone.
36974,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"I probably won't ever remember my former name, but we were buddies."
36975,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Buddies?
36976,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Before we were Ants.
36977,Deadline x To x Live.,133,They're our enemies.
36978,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Enemies of NGL.
36979,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Am I wrong?
36980,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Brovada has forgotten his past, but he was also one of us."
36981,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Take him with you.
36982,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Ikalgo...
36983,Deadline x To x Live.,133,How do you know?
36984,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What do you mean?
36985,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You told me to go see Gyro.
36986,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.
36987,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Yeah, that's true."
36988,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But...
36989,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I don't know that he's alive.
36990,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I just can't believe otherwise.
36991,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Since we all ""survived."""
36992,Deadline x To x Live.,133,He couldn't have just been digested.
36993,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Damn it... Damn it!
36994,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Damn it!
36995,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Are you sure about this, Pouf?"
36996,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Ten minutes have passed, and I don't \Nsee any sign of Pitou returning..."
36997,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Get out.
36998,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.
36999,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Once you're outside, you'll understand \Nthe current situation."
37000,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I hate to admit it...
37001,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But Ikalgo's right.
37002,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.
37003,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Which means they're the enemy.
37004,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.
37005,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I'll be his messenger!
37006,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Stop!
37007,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi-dono?
37008,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I already found a Royal Guard.
37009,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi-dono...
37010,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I have a message that must be \Ntaken to the King immediately.
37011,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The underground warehouse?
37012,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Yes.
37013,Deadline x To x Live.,133,And they're looking to exchange the woman for their allies that \Nhave been taken hostage?
37014,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Yes.
37015,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Please tell the King at once.
37016,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Got it... I'm on it.
37017,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Right...
37018,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"We're having a contest, so I \Ndon't need to tell the King."
37019,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one."
37020,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You can go.
37021,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Yes, sir."
37022,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf."
37023,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Still, what's Pitou doing right now?"
37024,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Chimera Ants are the enemy.
37025,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Gyro's enemy...
37026,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Our enemy!
37027,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi-dono!
37028,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I have a question!
37029,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What is it?
37030,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Do you have any memories of your former life?
37031,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Memories from before you \Nbecame a Chimera Ant?
37032,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"No, of course not."
37033,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I am the Royal Guard Youpi.
37034,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I've never been anyone else.
37035,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Don't ask me stupid questions!
37036,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi-dono...
37037,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Hey! That's enough—
37038,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"If you attack me, I'll fight back."
37039,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I have a few questions for you.
37040,Deadline x To x Live.,133,You have five seconds to answer.
37041,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Don't get too cocky, you little punk!"
37042,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Contest...
37043,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Contest...
37044,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Something is missing...
37045,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Marshal
37046,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Marshal
37047,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Marshal
37048,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Yes...
37049,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I was battling someone.
37050,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Someone that I have yet to defeat a single time...
37051,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That took much longer than expected.
37052,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"By now, Pitou must have returned..."
37053,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.
37054,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Where's Youpi?
37055,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Where has Youpi gone?
37056,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What's that?
37057,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi?
37058,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I-It can't be...
37059,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We're okay now...
37060,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"What do you mean, Palm?"
37061,Deadline x To x Live.,133,King! Meruem-sama!
37062,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Youpi has been killed.
37063,Deadline x To x Live.,133,There are still skilled enemies around!
37064,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Where's Pitou?
37065,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Oh, Pitou hasn't returned..."
37066,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Then...
37067,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"I can now begin, yes?"
37068,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"W-Wait, Meruem-sama!"
37069,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The situation has changed...
37070,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's too dangerous! The contest is—
37071,Deadline x To x Live.,133,The contest is off?
37072,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That means I have won.
37073,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Tell me everything you know.
37074,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Is that acceptable?
37075,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We're okay now?
37076,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"What do you mean, Palm?"
37077,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Killua deduced that she is special to the King.
37078,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But the Royal Guard is divided...
37079,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That is because
37080,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Pitou tried to save and protect her, while Pouf tried to kill her."
37081,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"In other words, she is a double-edged sword for the King."
37082,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Wait, wait, wait, wait..."
37083,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I find that hard to believe.
37084,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's impossible for the Royal Guard to bicker \Nand defy the King's will!
37085,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Is it?
37086,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Then why are you and I here now?
37087,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants to side with humans?
37088,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Adding humans to the gene pool has led to many events that would be \Nimpossible for normal Chimera Ants.
37089,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Can you be certain that I'm wrong?
37090,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Sorry...
37091,Deadline x To x Live.,133,My point is that the division among the Royal Guard \Nmay not necessarily contradict their loyalty to the King.
37092,Deadline x To x Live.,133,There is a human that the \NKing cares deeply about.
37093,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"""We must protect that human."""
37094,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"""We must kill that human."""
37095,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Both reactions make sense.
37096,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"For now, I'll concede that point to you."
37097,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Why does that mean we're okay now?
37098,Deadline x To x Live.,133,En{\i0
37099,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.
37100,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I don't get it...
37101,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What's going on here?
37102,Deadline x To x Live.,133,En{\i0
37103,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"If the King had noticed, he would have come straight to me."
37104,Deadline x To x Live.,133,He didn't because I had \Nconcealed her within my hair.
37105,Deadline x To x Live.,133,It's possible that he didn't realize \NI was carrying another person.
37106,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Are you following me?
37107,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"It seems logical, so I can't argue that..."
37108,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But I still don't see your point.
37109,Deadline x To x Live.,133,En{\i0
37110,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Are you suggesting that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die, \Nrather than make an exchange?"
37111,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Of course not...
37112,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We'll offer to make an exchange.
37113,Deadline x To x Live.,133,But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.
37114,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place where the King cannot find her."
37115,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Buy time? How long are we talking?
37116,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Until the King dies.
37117,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What is she talking about?
37118,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Until the King dies?
37119,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Sure, he has to die sometime..."
37120,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"But if we knew when he'd die, \Nwe wouldn't have a problem!"
37121,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Why are we okay now?
37122,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Give me a proper explanation!
37123,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"The King will die, and it will happen soon."
37124,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Within the next few hours, the King will die!"
37125,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We need to go deeper...
37126,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"Yes, we must put her in a place \Nwhere only we can find her."
37127,Deadline x To x Live.,133,That should do it.
37128,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"All that's left is to negotiate, without going far enough to make the King snap."
37129,Deadline x To x Live.,133,I know...
37130,Deadline x To x Live.,133,What we're doing is cruel.
37131,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We are no different from them.
37132,Deadline x To x Live.,133,No...
37133,Deadline x To x Live.,133,We are far worse!
37134,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Pitou... Pitou...
37135,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Where are you?
37136,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Pitou!
37137,Deadline x To x Live.,133,Next time: The Word x Is x That Someone.
37138,Deadline x To x Live.,133,"And it isn't ""Killua."""
37139,Deadline x To x Live.,133,And that's all there is to it.
37140,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,We are no different from the Ants.
37141,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,No...
37142,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,We are far worse.
37143,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The rose was poisonous.
37144,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"The poison, which spread \Nwhen the rose bloomed, was superior to similar toxins because it was immediately absorbed by \Nthose in the area unfortunate enough to survive the explosion."
37145,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Rapid destruction of their organs would begin, and their bodies themselves would become poisons that continued to \Nemit new poison, until the victim died."
37146,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The amount of poison for a lethal dose and \Nthe amount of time until the subject died perfectly created a chain of poisoned victims.
37147,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"In other words, it was a demonic weapon \Nmore inhumane than any other."
37148,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The Word x Is x That Someone
37149,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Th-This is...
37150,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,What is happening to my body?
37151,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Pouf.
37152,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Is something the matter, Meruem-sama?"
37153,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Have you changed your mind?
37154,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"In that case, we must evacuate you at once."
37155,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Your Majesty?
37156,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Even when I can see right through him, he still refuses to divulge his secret."
37157,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Very well.
37158,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I only have to capture the remaining intruders.
37159,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am very curious about your secret now.
37160,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"You do not intend to change your \Nmind about telling me, do you?"
37161,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"I will keep my word, even if it costs me my life."
37162,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Good.
37163,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He's already using his final \Npermissible {\i0
37164,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I can see everything.
37165,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134, En.
37166,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The footprints that were not there before.
37167,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,An abandoned vehicle.
37168,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Youpi's corpse.
37169,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,A door that has been opened.
37170,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134, \NEn {\i1
37171,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Huh?!
37172,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Was it you who killed Youpi?
37173,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,A-Absolutely not!
37174,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am a mere Squadron Leader!
37175,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I would never have any reason to kill Youpi-dono!
37176,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Youpi-dono was talking to me when he \Nsuddenly coughed up blood, became overcome with pain, and died."
37177,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I swear that I'm not lying!
37178,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I'm not lying...
37179,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Yes, I did attack Youpi."
37180,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,But before he could answer my question...
37181,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Before my black centipedes could even hatch...
37182,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He died.
37183,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I believe that he must have been hit by some sort of attack before encountering me.
37184,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,That's why I came here to \Ninvestigate if any intruders are hidden in the crowd.
37185,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The Royal Guard Pouf...
37186,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He's going to be trouble.
37187,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I'm pretty sure he has the \Nability to read my mind.
37188,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Welfin is a serious threat.
37189,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I have no idea what he might tell the King...
37190,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Simply telling him to keep quiet \Nwould be too lenient.
37191,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I should eliminate him immediately!
37192,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"I should accuse him of being a traitor, \Nand execute him on the spot."
37193,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"In any case, I must get him away from the King."
37194,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Meruem-sama, he is—"
37195,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I know what you want to say.
37196,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,En{\i0
37197,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I could feel his unbridled hostility toward me.
37198,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,In...
37199,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Incredible...
37200,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,En{\i0
37201,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I can see into their mind by simply looking.
37202,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,So it wasn't just Youpi's wings and attacks.
37203,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The King also inherited my Spiritual Message...
37204,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,And he's made it infinitely more powerful.
37205,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Your Majesty!
37206,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The King is invincible...
37207,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The King is unrivaled!
37208,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,And yet...
37209,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Why?!
37210,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Why is my heart filled with such unease?
37211,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Now there is some fear mixed in, but there is no concealing \Nyour desire to kill me."
37212,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am interested to learn what drives your hatred of me.
37213,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Speak.
37214,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Lie, and you will regret it."
37215,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is no time to let emotion \Nget the better of me!
37216,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Tell me what you know.
37217,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Meruem-sama!
37218,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,You must follow the proper order.
37219,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He has deep ties to my secret.
37220,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"However, he does not realize this."
37221,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"If you continue questioning him, it is very likely that he will reveal part, or all, of my secret."
37222,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"When the King has such power, lies are futile."
37223,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Then I must use the truth!
37224,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I believe that you would not want your reward before winning the contest.
37225,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I will keep my secret hidden using only truth!
37226,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"If you wish to continue our contest,"
37227,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I believe you should wait to question him.
37228,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,What is this guy talking about?
37229,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Secret? What secret?
37230,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Wait, what do I do now?"
37231,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,How do I escape from this monster?
37232,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Damn it!
37233,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I didn't realize he was this powerful!
37234,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I should have run away right off the bat.
37235,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Temptation got the better of me!
37236,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"When I saw the giant Youpi \Nshrunken down like some bug, and then he dropped dead,"
37237,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I actually had the delusion that I could be King...
37238,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,So I stayed...
37239,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I was drunk on my delusion!
37240,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"I felt almighty, like some sheltered little kid."
37241,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I felt alive.
37242,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Yeah, I'm an idiot! I was drunk!"
37243,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Too many things happened simultaneously, \Nand then I remembered Gyro."
37244,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"I panicked and got sentimental, \Nand wanted to be a hero!"
37245,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I thought I could avenge Gyro.
37246,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,But Gyro isn't even dead...
37247,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"He's alive, for sure!"
37248,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"I should have run, and teamed up with him again \Nbefore seeking revenge!"
37249,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Damn it!
37250,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,It's that octopus's fault.
37251,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He threw me off my game.
37252,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He threw my emotions out of whack.
37253,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He led me astray!
37254,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Damn him! ""Messenger,"" my eye!"
37255,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I have to do something. \NHe knows my intent is hostile.
37256,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,And I can't lie...
37257,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He'll send my head flying before \NI can activate Missile Man!
37258,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,What tools do I have left?
37259,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The message?
37260,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Pouf's secret?
37261,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The drive behind my hatred?
37262,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Everything that I know?
37263,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Will it be enough to save me? What do I say?
37264,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The first...
37265,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The first word I say is key.
37266,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Just one word will decide \Nwhether I live or die.
37267,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"If I choose the wrong one, it's all over!"
37268,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This overwhelming pressure.
37269,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This abnormal tension.
37270,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Pouf, does that secret have any relationship to the hatred he feels toward me?"
37271,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is the King...
37272,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"After interrupting me in the \Nmiddle of my questioning, you gave me a direct order."
37273,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I presume that you are prepared \Nto accept the consequences.
37274,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I want a sincere answer.
37275,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is...
37276,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The King's new power meant that he could probe for the answer he sought without waiting for Pouf to speak.
37277,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Despite the understanding that he \Nhad Pouf's unwavering loyalty, the murderous aura visibly \Nemanating from the King indicated that Pouf would have no choice but to atone with his death if that answer \Nwas not what the King wanted."
37278,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Loyalty and hostility were equally meaningless before the King.
37279,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,No one could stop him.
37280,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Even then,"
37281,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I was already prepared to die.
37282,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I will sacrifice myself to my own loyalty.
37283,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,There is nothing that I can say.
37284,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Though the contest has yet to conclude.
37285,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,That is all there is to it...
37286,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,His incredible resolve and madness stopped the King.
37287,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am hungry.
37288,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,However...
37289,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Welfin immediately understood...
37290,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am...
37291,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I am going to be eaten!
37292,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One second later...
37293,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I'm dead!
37294,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Upon learning his fate,"
37295,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Welfin instantly appeared \Nto age one hundred years.
37296,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I want to live.
37297,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"That was when his past rapidly \Nflashed through his mind and then scattered, the fragments \Nmingling with his present."
37298,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word...
37299,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,My first and last!
37300,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Caught between the desire to live \Nand unavoidable death...
37301,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word...
37302,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The message for the King!
37303,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word!
37304,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,What Pouf discussed with Pitou!
37305,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word!
37306,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Pouf's secret!
37307,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word!
37308,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I...
37309,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,One word!
37310,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,...won't die until I'm dead!
37311,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"As his brain cells began working \Nharder than ever before, he made a choice that he never would \Nhave in normal circumstances."
37312,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Komugi?
37313,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This...
37314,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is...
37315,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is how deeply he values her!
37316,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Pouf...
37317,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,This is your secret.
37318,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Yes.
37319,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,He values her more than I feared.
37320,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Punish me for my actions.
37321,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,No words are needed.
37322,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,We are one now.
37323,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,There will be no punishment.
37324,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I never had a chance...
37325,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Yes.
37326,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Continue searching for Pitou.
37327,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The two captured intruders \Nmay have information.
37328,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Once you are done, release them."
37329,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I have nothing else to ask them.
37330,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,All I can do is nod.
37331,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Yes.
37332,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,The opened door...
37333,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,And footprints leading inside.
37334,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,En.
37335,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,All signs lead to one conclusion.
37336,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Welfin...
37337,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Y-Yes!
37338,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Komugi is in the underground warehouse \Nwith the woman and the octopus.
37339,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Your job was to deliver that information \Nto me or the Royal Guard.
37340,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,H-How did you know that?
37341,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I believe the octopus was the \Nreason you accepted this job.
37342,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,There was a different reason \Nwhy you did not complete it.
37343,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Is that reason the cause of your hatred for me?
37344,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,So it is.
37345,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Do not worry.
37346,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"Once you answer my question, \Nyou are free to go wherever you wish."
37347,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,You have my thanks.
37348,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,You helped me to remember \Nsomething very important.
37349,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"They said that they're waiting in Bizeff's \Nprivate courtyard, in Area D."
37350,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Gyro is the only man I'll ever call King!
37351,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,You... All of you...
37352,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Are enemies!
37353,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Our enemies!
37354,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Is that so?
37355,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I hope you find him...
37356,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,"And if possible,"
37357,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,I hope you can live as a human.
37358,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Netero once believed that the King was wavering \Nbetween human and Ant.
37359,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,But now...
37360,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Next time: This Person x And x This Moment.
37361,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Will you call me by my name?
37362,The Word x Is x That Someone.,134,Huh? Me?
37363,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,En{\i0 and scattered them everywhere.
37364,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If there are conditions I must meet \Nfor you to turn over Komugi, speak."
37365,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,This Person x And x This Moment
37366,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"It appears that only one of you is here, but I shall address this \Nmessage to both of you."
37367,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,He knows exactly what we're doing.
37368,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,We won't be able to trick him.
37369,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Nen{\i0 was not anger, fear, or hatred."
37370,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Only senses of duty and resolve.
37371,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If you are fighting for the survival \Nof humanity, your battle is over."
37372,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You need further explanation?
37373,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It seems you doubt what you've just heard.
37374,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Then I shall repeat myself.
37375,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You have won... The battle is over.
37376,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The rest of what I have to \Nsay is for your ears only.
37377,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The reason I am here is quite simple.
37378,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I have one motive...
37379,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I wish to see the human named Komugi.
37380,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,That is all I want.
37381,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,That is really all I want.
37382,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I desire nothing else.
37383,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Nen{\i0
37384,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I learned my current state and fate.
37385,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"And having learned my fate, I simply wish to spend my remaining time with Komugi."
37386,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,That is all I want.
37387,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Was this...
37388,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Was this a plan you devised after \Ndiscovering my personality?
37389,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"No, I already know the answer..."
37390,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It's impossible.
37391,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You expect me to believe you?
37392,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You think I'll just accept that explanation?!
37393,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,An omnipotent King would \Nnever lie to himself in order to fool a lower being like me!
37394,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"After all the killing you have done, \Nand soon will do..."
37395,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,A creature like you...
37396,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?
37397,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Impossible! That's impossible!
37398,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,He's doing this because it is the truth!
37399,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I believe it was only a slight change...
37400,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Huh?
37401,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly."
37402,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"In my current state, I am not a god, but I..."
37403,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,No...
37404,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Perhaps, I only feel this way \Nbecause everything has fallen into place."
37405,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You should know I have very little time.
37406,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"I want you to tell me her location, so I do not have to search for her."
37407,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,What are you saying?!
37408,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Stop this...
37409,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, I know where she is!"
37410,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Why don't you just torture it out of me?
37411,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I know the answer.
37412,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,We both know that isn't an option.
37413,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Your aura is as strong and beautiful \Nas any I have ever beheld.
37414,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Stop this!
37415,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,All I can do is to ask you to help me.
37416,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Don't!
37417,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I am part Ant now...
37418,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I know very well how important \Nyou are to the race...
37419,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Not that...
37420,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Don't go to such lengths...
37421,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You mustn't do that...
37422,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'll tell you.
37423,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But on one condition.
37424,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,May I use my power to watch your final moments with her?
37425,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If that is what it takes to be with Komugi, you certainly may."
37426,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Sorry, Killua..."
37427,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I couldn't keep our promise...
37428,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"4-7-1, marshal..."
37429,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Wake up, Komugi."
37430,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It's time to play.
37431,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,We have a shocking news update.
37432,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The true purpose of the summoning of all Republic of East Gorteau \Ncitizens to the capital city was a plot by the Supreme \NLeader to massacre them.
37433,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"The body of Supreme Leader Diego \Nwas discovered under the rubble, suggesting that the victims were \Nlikely forced into mass suicide."
37434,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"But the second-in-command, \NSecretary Bizeff, is still missing, so some authorities believe a \Nrevolution is the greater likelihood."
37435,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Meanwhile, there has also been trouble in the NGL region of the Mitene Union, \Nas international peacekeepers have sent queries regarding refugees, and have received no response."
37436,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"There have been rumors of illicit dealings between \NEast Gorteau and NGL, and the international community \Nseeks to use this incident as an opportunity to conduct \Na more forceful investigation."
37437,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yeah, the boss did his duty."
37438,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"No, I wasn't there to see it."
37439,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It still isn't clear yet.
37440,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yeah, we're waiting on Palm."
37441,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Can we really trust her alone to verify the King's death?
37442,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Plus, that person was captured and converted by the enemy, yes?"
37443,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Well, that's a question of professionalism."
37444,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It would be professional to provide a complete report \Nin the safest manner possible.
37445,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But those are the professionals who spend all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.
37446,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"And when we field Hunters are told \Nto trust a partner, we trust them."
37447,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,We're all professionals...
37448,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But I'm the one out in the field!
37449,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'm not sitting in an office!
37450,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The Vice Chairman's faction won't \Naccept that argument.
37451,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If they find out, you can expect \Nto be questioned, at the least."
37452,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Uh, I am Netero..."
37453,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Chairman, thank you for a job well done."
37454,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,May you rest in peace.
37455,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"The same day, a video was streamed \Nonline in which Netero announced his resignation as Chairman \Nof the Hunter Association, and gave instructions for \Nchoosing his successor."
37456,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"However, major news stories in the \Ngovernment-run media overshadowed it, and only a few realized that \Nthe video was his will."
37457,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Now, let us drink."
37458,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Let us drink.
37459,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Drink to the human race.
37460,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"In every age, there will be good \Nhumans and bad humans."
37461,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Human life is too long \Nto devote to reproduction, yet too short to devote to learning, \Nin the helix of time."
37462,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Perhaps that is why humans succumb \Nto desire and seek release.
37463,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Despite the fact that life is complete \Nwith the sun, the land, and poetry."
37464,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Supreme Leader Diego (Real) \NIn his 30th year of retirement, \Non a farm, in an unnamed country"
37465,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It's over...
37466,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But it feels like we \Nhaven't played in ages...
37467,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Playing in real life is completely different \Nthan playing in my dreams.
37468,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes.
37469,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I thought I felt someone kick \Nme hard in the stomach.
37470,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"After that, a strange person kidnapped me..."
37471,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader."
37472,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.
37473,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I was wrong?!
37474,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
37475,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I was unworthy of their loyalty...
37476,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"When they stop by, I must thank them."
37477,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I will relay your gratitude.
37478,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'll be seeing them soon...
37479,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I know. Let's begin.
37480,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes!
37481,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Once, you asked my name."
37482,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Y-Yes...
37483,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,My name is Meruem.
37484,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem.
37485,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It means the light that illuminates all.
37486,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem-sama?
37487,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,M-My name is Komugi...
37488,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It is an honor to know you!
37489,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I know.
37490,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,No...
37491,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,That isn't true.
37492,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I knew nothing.
37493,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I didn't understand what really mattered.
37494,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem-sama?
37495,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,No honorific is necessary.
37496,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Don't make me repeat myself!
37497,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,No honorific is necessary!
37498,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"B-But, I could never do that!"
37499,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I would never dare address \Nyou without an honorific!
37500,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will \Naddress me without the honorific."
37501,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I understand.
37502,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Do I die after I've addressed \Nyou without the honorific?
37503,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Ah, that's right."
37504,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,There is no need for you to die.
37505,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I am not the same person I was before.
37506,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You should be prepared to lose.
37507,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes!
37508,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,What do you want if you win?
37509,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I would like another match!
37510,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It was a foolish question.
37511,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Let's begin, then."
37512,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"1-5-1, marshal."
37513,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"9-9-1, marshal."
37514,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"7-9-1, pawn."
37515,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"2-3-1, pawn."
37516,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"2-7-2, musketeer."
37517,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Could it be?
37518,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"7-1-2, fortress."
37519,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,This is...
37520,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Marshal
37521,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,...kokoriko?
37522,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, do you mean to mock me?"
37523,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,No.
37524,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I want a sincere answer.
37525,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I will not allow you to fool around.
37526,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, I have never fooled around \Nwhile playing Gungi."
37527,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Very well.
37528,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If you lose, you will die."
37529,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes.
37530,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Certain Death
37531,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Is she saying this will not \Nmean her certain death?
37532,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,She had a number of other options.
37533,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But all would only serve to lengthen the game without increasing her chances.
37534,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,If she thinks she has a chance to win...
37535,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"9-2-1, new lieutenant general."
37536,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I want to see where this goes!
37537,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"4-6-2, spy."
37538,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Th-This is...
37539,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,She has found a way out.
37540,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"That night, I realized something."
37541,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Quiet!
37542,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Let me think.
37543,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Here.
37544,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,This is the only way to go!
37545,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I should be able to checkmate her!
37546,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"When she's forced closer to my position, \Nmy advantage grows with each move."
37547,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"But if she slows down and allows \Nme a turn to attack, she can't stop the knight \Nand lieutenant general!"
37548,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"2-6-1, knight!"
37549,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I reversed her new move!
37550,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,What now?
37551,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,What is wrong?
37552,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Why do you cry?
37553,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Am I...
37554,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Am I allowed to be so happy?
37555,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Can...
37556,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Can so many wonderful things happen to someone like me?
37557,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I suppose I must tell you the truth.
37558,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I...
37559,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"I have been poisoned, and I have little time."
37560,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem-sama...
37561,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, I wanted... to spend my final moments \Nplaying against you."
37562,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,But this poison is contagious.
37563,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"If you stay near me too long, you will also..."
37564,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,She reversed my reversal?
37565,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem-sama...
37566,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Right now, I am very happy."
37567,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"I may not be worthy, but please allow me to join you."
37568,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I see...
37569,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I...
37570,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I believe that I was born to be here today.
37571,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,...was born for this moment.
37572,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Spy               Marshal
37573,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"4-4-1, pawn."
37574,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"6-5-1, knight."
37575,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"2-7-2, new spy."
37576,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, are you still there?"
37577,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, I sure am."
37578,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'm not going anywhere.
37579,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"4-5-1, lieutenant general."
37580,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,That's checkmate.
37581,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, are you still here?"
37582,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, yes... Right here."
37583,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Let's play another match.
37584,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,The loser goes first.
37585,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Komugi...
37586,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, yes? What is it?"
37587,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,It appears I never defeated \Nyou a single time.
37588,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,What are you saying?
37589,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,We've just gotten started!
37590,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes...
37591,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"1-5-1, marshal."
37592,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"9-5-1, marshal."
37593,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, are you still here?"
37594,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, of course."
37595,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"It's your turn, Meruem-sama."
37596,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'm a little tired...
37597,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I need to take a short nap.
37598,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Will you hold my hand?
37599,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Komugi?
37600,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Komugi, are you there?"
37601,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I can hear you.
37602,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I understand.
37603,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Like this?
37604,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'll wake up shortly.
37605,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Will you stay by my side until I wake?
37606,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I've never left your side.
37607,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'll always be here.
37608,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Komugi...
37609,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Yes, yes? What is it?"
37610,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Thank you.
37611,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,You're welcome.
37612,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Will you call me...
37613,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Yes?
37614,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,...by my name one last time?
37615,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Good night,"
37616,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Meruem...
37617,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,I'll be joining you soon.
37618,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Next time: Homecoming x And x True Name.
37619,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"I'm home, Mito-san!"
37620,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,"Welcome home, Reina-chan."
37621,This Person x And x This Moment.,135,Eh? What?!
37622,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Homecoming x And x True Name
37623,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"With the death of King Meruem, the battle between Chimera Ants \Nand humans was over."
37624,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Republic of Rokario \N\NNGL Autonomous Region
37625,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hass Republic
37626,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Republic of East Gorteau    Republic of West Gorteau
37627,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"The Republic of East Gorteau and \Nthe NGL were tentatively placed under control of international peacekeepers, and the nations essentially ceased to exist."
37628,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Between the two former nations, five million survivors were declared refugees."
37629,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The Mitene Union's three remaining members divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed to jointly govern the former nation's territory.
37630,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"As for the NGL, there was a proposal to give all open land permanent designation as nature reserves, \Nto prevent future incidents."
37631,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,And the international community concurred.
37632,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It was agreed that the nature reserves would be under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.
37633,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Are you sure about this?
37634,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Yeah, I'm gonna live here."
37635,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"The name ""Gyro"" doesn't mean anything to me."
37636,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,But this place feels very familiar.
37637,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident \Nthat didn't work for Gyro...
37638,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Well, I won't force you to come, then."
37639,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,This is probably safer than other countries now.
37640,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Exactly.
37641,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"One look at me, and the peacekeepers \Nwould freeze on the spot."
37642,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Is that why she's staying?
37643,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"No, in her case..."
37644,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,She seems more like you guys.
37645,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,What do you mean?
37646,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hey! Aren't you done?
37647,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,We'll leave you behind!
37648,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!"
37649,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Well, people like me who barely \Nremember our previous lives can tell that people like you and Hina, \Nwho have their memories, are different."
37650,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,There's something in your eyes.
37651,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Or it's how you look into the distance.
37652,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Somehow, I can tell at once."
37653,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"""This guy remembers his past."""
37654,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,And I can tell that she remembers her past.
37655,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hina said she'll never talk to us...
37656,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,But I don't think it's that she won't talk.
37657,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's that she can't talk.
37658,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,She's probably just a kid.
37659,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Welfin!
37660,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Zip it! I get the idea!
37661,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,See ya.
37662,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"We probably won't see each \Nother again, so take care."
37663,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Yeah.
37664,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Try not to die until you're dead.
37665,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The hell is that?
37666,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Gyro's way of saying goodbye.
37667,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's one of my favorite phrases.
37668,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Did you just remember something?
37669,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,No... I just kinda like the phrase.
37670,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Oh.
37671,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"So life is what you make of it, huh?"
37672,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Later.
37673,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Yeah.
37674,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Well, let's get going."
37675,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!
37676,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Seriously, you have no shame."
37677,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Not so long ago, it was \N""Hagya-sama"" this, ""Leol-sama"" that."
37678,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Who's that?
37679,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Huh?
37680,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,No point in thinking about the dead.
37681,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I have to move forward!
37682,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Straight ahead!
37683,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Still... Are you sure we can \Nmake it through the port?
37684,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Yeah, this is a government vehicle, so once I show my card, they'll let us pass."
37685,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City..."
37686,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,How far I've fallen.
37687,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Don't be so negative about it.
37688,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Just be patient.
37689,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.
37690,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's possible that he's already gathered all the sympathizers and tools we'll need to build our own nation.
37691,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Which means...
37692,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"In no time, we'll be back on top!"
37693,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Yay!
37694,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"You're so optimistic, I can only envy you."
37695,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Optimistic?
37696,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You've got that right.
37697,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I've already died twice...
37698,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,But I'm still alive!
37699,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Nothing scares me now.
37700,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm ready for anything!
37701,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Plus,"
37702,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm the one who stopped the King.
37703,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,H-Hey...
37704,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal."
37705,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.
37706,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Yeah, that's the spirit."
37707,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Humans are alive until they're dead!
37708,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,What? You're stating the obvious!
37709,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Quiet!
37710,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to \NMeteor City, in search of Gyro."
37711,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Is that the village?
37712,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hey...
37713,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Don't worry.
37714,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm with you.
37715,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Monsters!
37716,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Well, that's to be expected."
37717,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hey!
37718,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,People of NGL!
37719,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I need someone who can communicate in a peaceful and reasonable manner!
37720,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm not here to harm anyone!
37721,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I just have a question to ask!
37722,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hey! You can speak?
37723,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Who are you?
37724,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Uh...
37725,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"This will probably be hard to believe, \Nbut will you hear me out?"
37726,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You're the only people I can turn to!
37727,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Reina?
37728,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,How did... you know?
37729,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Reina...
37730,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Reina...
37731,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Reina!
37732,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,How did you know?
37733,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Of course I knew...
37734,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!"
37735,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Welcome home.
37736,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm so glad you're back.
37737,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Brother tried to protect me!
37738,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"He told the monster to go away, and told me to run... He kept me safe!"
37739,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,But I was too scared to move!
37740,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm sorry!
37741,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's okay... I'm sorry.
37742,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You and Kurt did your best.
37743,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.
37744,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...
37745,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Welcome home, Reina-chan."
37746,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You must be hungry.
37747,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Let's eat together.
37748,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hey...
37749,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Why don't you join us?
37750,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,No... I'll pass.
37751,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Don't say that.
37752,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You saved Reina-chan.
37753,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Please let us feed you.
37754,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,That isn't what I was doing...
37755,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,See ya.
37756,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Damn...
37757,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I've returned the favor, okay?"
37758,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Damn that stupid octopus!
37759,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,He never should've let me live!
37760,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Thank you...
37761,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Let's eat.
37762,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Let's eat together.
37763,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Huh?
37764,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,What's going on?
37765,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,What... What's wrong?
37766,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Reina and Brovada return home.
37767,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Hello? Is this Colt?
37768,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's me.
37769,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The politicians have turned this \Ninto an international crisis.
37770,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The Ants are no longer involved.
37771,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,No longer involved?
37772,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Is that actually possible?
37773,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,That's what politicians do.
37774,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.
37775,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Magical Beast...
37776,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Well, if they label you as a good \NMagical Beast, you'll be fine."
37777,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Any changes on your side?
37778,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Actually, something has been bothering me."
37779,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Something bothering you?
37780,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Yeah, it's Reina."
37781,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,No! You're wrong!
37782,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.
37783,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"What is it, then?"
37784,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm not Reina!
37785,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,My name is Kite!
37786,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Gon!
37787,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Killua!
37788,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Doctor...
37789,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,How's Gon?
37790,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,He's still in critical condition.
37791,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I wouldn't recommend sending \Nhim to a specialist until he can be taken off life support.
37792,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I've never seen or heard of anything like this.
37793,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,How could this happen overnight \Nto a twelve-year-old boy?
37794,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I understand.
37795,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,We'll bring the specialist here.
37796,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,He's a hero who's earned special treatment.
37797,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I will cover all the expenses.
37798,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"If necessary, we may have to \Nrebuild this entire hospital."
37799,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"In any case, we cannot let Gon die."
37800,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"In the end, you did everything by yourself..."
37801,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I want that one myself!
37802,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I get it.
37803,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Kite saved your life, and he \Nhas no connection to me."
37804,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,But... Still...
37805,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I wanted you to ask for my \Nhelp in defeating Pitou!
37806,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Let's go.
37807,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Did you say that to me as a teammate?
37808,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Or as a friend?
37809,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I know...
37810,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,This is just a tantrum.
37811,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,It's the same as always.
37812,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"You run ahead, while I clean up after you."
37813,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The same as always...
37814,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'll clean up your mess!
37815,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"But this time, I won't let it slide."
37816,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You have to apologize.
37817,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm going to heal you up!
37818,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,So you have to apologize!
37819,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Killua...
37820,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,We're assembling a team of \Nmedical specialists to save Gon.
37821,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I must head back, so I can use \NHide and Seek to transport equipment and people."
37822,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Will you come with me?
37823,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"No, I won't."
37824,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,That's true...
37825,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"It's important to stay with Gon \Nand talk to him, as well."
37826,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm going to save Gon.
37827,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,You go get those doctors.
37828,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,They'll still be needed...
37829,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,While I'm gone.
37830,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Killua?
37831,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm the one who'll save Gon!
37832,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"Uh, I am Netero..."
37833,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own."
37834,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,The next chairman will be selected by election.
37835,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I am setting the condition that \Nall Hunters must vote.
37836,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"If voter turnout is under 95%, \Nthe results will be invalid."
37837,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I ask that the Zodiacs handle the details, \Nsuch as schedule and polling method."
37838,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'd say the difficulty for this mission is D-rank.
37839,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I'm counting on you all.
37840,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Take care.
37841,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"In response to Netero's message, the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders, \Nassembled at headquarters that day."
37842,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.
37843,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,I won't say anything until I've seen your face.
37844,Homecoming x And x True Name.,136,"I'm going to heal you up, so you have to apologize!"
37845,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Chairman Netero gathered the top \Nleaders of the Hunter Association, the Zodiacs, for the purpose of \Nelecting the next chairman."
37846,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The Zodiacs...
37847,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Twelve Hunters whose abilities \Nthe chairman had recognized.
37848,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"In emergencies, he entrusted \Nthem with leading the Association."
37849,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"When nothing was happening, they \Naccompanied him in leisure activities."
37850,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Each Zodiac is assigned a code name...
37851,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"And most members, out of \Nadoration for the chairman, made moving efforts to embody their code names, such as changing their names or personas."
37852,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"However, there are exceptions."
37853,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Debate X Among X Zodiacs
37854,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Chairman!
37855,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Mizaistom (Ox)
37856,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I thought we had all the Zodiacs present, but the Rat is missing."
37857,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Piyon (Rabbit)
37858,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"The Vice Chairman is very busy, even at a time like this."
37859,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Geru (Snake)
37860,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's because it is a time like this.
37861,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"He's scrambling to secure votes for himself, I'm sure."
37862,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ginta (Sheep)
37863,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Chairman!
37864,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ginta... You're loud, annoying, and you smell!"
37865,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Cluck (Chicken)
37866,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Saiyu (Monkey)
37867,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Even the habitual slacker Ging showed up!
37868,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Guess the Rat's just a scumbag.
37869,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ging (Boar)
37870,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"What do you mean, ""even"" I showed up?"
37871,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I'll kill you, monkey."
37872,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Go ahead and try it, dumbass."
37873,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Botobai (Dragon)
37874,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I can't accept this.
37875,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why didn't the chairman call us to help?
37876,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Kanzai (Tiger)
37877,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Agreed.
37878,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Morel and Knov were above that kind of job!
37879,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""Above"" is not the word you're looking for."
37880,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Cheadle (Dog)
37881,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"You wanted to hunt the Ants yourself, did you not?"
37882,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The chairman wanted all of us together for this.
37883,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Saccho (Horse)
37884,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Let's wait for him to arrive.
37885,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Hey! Sorry I'm late!
37886,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Pariston (Rat)
37887,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,My apologies!
37888,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Everyone is in a frenzy over what's \Ngoing on with East Gorteau.
37889,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's a big problem.
37890,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Just sit down.
37891,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Oh, sorry about that."
37892,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Then let's begin this meeting on the \Nelection of the next chairman.
37893,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Hold on!
37894,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why are you leading the meeting?
37895,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Huh? Is there a problem?
37896,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Don't boss us around after you showed up late.
37897,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Pariston, you're irritating! \NYou're a creep! Get lost!"
37898,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Well, I wasn't sure if I should take the lead."
37899,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"But you know, I'm the Vice Chairman."
37900,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I outrank the rest of you, and I'm \Ngood at coordinating these things."
37901,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm sure you all want to finish this quickly.
37902,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's why.
37903,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If we rank by age, Botobai-san should lead."
37904,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Judging by ability to foster progress, \NCheadle-san should lead."
37905,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Both are better suited to the task than I.
37906,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Would one of you be willing to take over?
37907,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'll refrain. You'd probably give me a hard time.
37908,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I concur.
37909,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Forget it. Just lead the meeting.
37910,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Just come out and say you \Nwant to do it, scumbag."
37911,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"In that case, if anyone objects \Nto me leading this meeting, raise your hand."
37912,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I object! I object! I seriously object!
37913,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I see four objections...
37914,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The majority says I should continue.
37915,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Of course, we can discuss any \Ncomplaints as they arise."
37916,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm ready to step down anytime.
37917,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Then, I have a proposal."
37918,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I will run for the position of chairman, so let's not bother with an election."
37919,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I'm gonna kill you, brat!"
37920,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Scary... Everyone calm down.
37921,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,My point is that we'll waste time and money.
37922,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,We already know the results.
37923,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,No one here will vote for you.
37924,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's eleven votes.
37925,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Together, you can only muster eleven votes."
37926,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Do you know how many Hunters \Nare in the Association?
37927,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The late Chairman Netero was too strong...
37928,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,So he couldn't understand \Nthe feelings of the weak.
37929,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The same can be said for all of you.
37930,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"However, I can understand the weak!"
37931,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That is the kind of Chairman I seek to be!
37932,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"The weak end up as your slaves, \Nworking under the name of intermediaries."
37933,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"How much have you made off \Nthem, Prince of Kickbacks?"
37934,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Please, you have it wrong. I'm asking \Nthem to contribute to the pool."
37935,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's meant to help the Association expand.
37936,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Eighteen people.
37937,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Do you know what that number represents?
37938,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The number of Hunters who've \Ngone missing in the three years since you became Vice Chairman.
37939,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"As professionals who risk our lives, we're obligated to be aware of the \Nsituations our trusted associates are in."
37940,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,A missing Hunter is more bizarre than \Na Hunter's unexpected death.
37941,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Before you became Vice Chairman, the \Naverage was 0.6 Hunters missing per year."
37942,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's increased tenfold.
37943,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Do you have anything to say?
37944,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That number is tragic... It pains me greatly.
37945,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Once I become Chairman, \Nthe number will surely decrease!"
37946,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'll run for Chairman.
37947,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm going to carry on the old man's will.
37948,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Don't want to vote for either of them!
37949,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ging-san, I hear something \Nhappened to your son..."
37950,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Sounds like it.
37951,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Should I visit him?
37952,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Sure, he'd probably be thrilled."
37953,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Would he even realize I was there?
37954,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I heard he's in critical condition.
37955,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Maybe I shouldn't go after all...
37956,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If he dies after I do, I'll have wasted my time."
37957,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Go visit him.
37958,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,He isn't going to die.
37959,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Uh, can I ask a question?"
37960,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"First, shouldn't we reevaluate \Nthe process for running?"
37961,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,You're the one who started it!
37962,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,What's wrong with your head?!
37963,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I only offered to serve in hopes \Nof saving us money and time.
37964,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If we can't avoid the process, \Nlet's first decide how to go about it."
37965,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There we go!
37966,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"When he controls the pace, everything becomes more complicated."
37967,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"In that case, we can draw lots."
37968,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Screw that!
37969,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,How can we have our leader chosen by chance?
37970,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Are you a scumbag, too?"
37971,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'll give a sheet of paper to each of you.
37972,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Hey...
37973,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I want each of you to write what you believe to be the optimal election process, with the prerequisite of achieving \Nat least 95% voter turnout."
37974,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,And a third party will pick one \Nof the proposals at random.
37975,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,A third party?
37976,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm guessing she means Beans.
37977,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Each proposal has a 1 in 12 chance.
37978,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,So there won't be any hard feelings.
37979,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's true...
37980,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Not a bad idea.
37981,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"That's fine, since I won't lose."
37982,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"But we should write down our names, \Nso we know whose idea is chosen."
37983,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"She said the odds are 1 in 12, but that isn't true."
37984,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If the ten of us write something \Nthat puts Pariston... and Ging, if possible... at a disadvantage, our odds will be 5 in 6."
37985,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If we record how each person votes,"
37986,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Pariston will have an advantage.
37987,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Should we use anonymous ballots to allow \Nfor dividing points among candidates?
37988,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Would our intermediaries then \Nbetray us with no guilt or fear?
37989,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"So here we are, Beans-san."
37990,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There are twelve sheets of paper inside.
37991,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Please pick one.
37992,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It will determine the rules \Nwe will use for the election.
37993,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,You want me to pick one?
37994,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This is an important task.
37995,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Then I will draw one.
37996,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The chosen proposal is Ging-san's.
37997,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ging's rules...
37998,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"He's no Pariston, but he's still trouble."
37999,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Rule #1.
38000,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""All Hunters are both candidates and voters."""
38001,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Rule #2.
38002,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""If the winner of the first election fails \Nto receive a majority of votes, the top sixteen will have a runoff."
38003,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If a majority is still not achieved, there will \Nbe another runoff with half the candidates."""
38004,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Rule #3.
38005,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""If the turnout for any given vote is under \N95%, that vote must be redone."""
38006,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Rule #4.
38007,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""Voters must write their name on the ballot. \NAnonymous votes will be invalid."""
38008,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,What are you thinking?!
38009,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why force people to sign them?
38010,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Are you an idiot? A total idiot?!
38011,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,You are the idiots.
38012,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"When everyone knows who voted for whom, it's a lot more entertaining."
38013,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There's his problem...
38014,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,He only cares about having fun!
38015,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Rule #5.
38016,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There's more?!
38017,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"""The election committee chairman \Nwill be Ging Freecss."""
38018,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I didn't think of that!
38019,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I didn't include such a rule...
38020,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That was a mistake.
38021,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I was too focused on the actual rules.
38022,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This is what Ging really wanted.
38023,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Now he can control the election as he pleases.
38024,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,May I say something?
38025,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"This drawing was to determine how the \Nelection would be conducted, correct?"
38026,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Rules one through four are fine, but the chairman should be chosen separately."
38027,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I can live with that.
38028,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,You can?
38029,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This is a Hunter.
38030,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Frightening...
38031,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Two Days Ago
38032,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ging-san!
38033,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Yo.
38034,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,What brings you here so early?
38035,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm surprised you actually came.
38036,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Yeah, I happened to be in the area."
38037,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That can't be true...
38038,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Thank you very much.
38039,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I saw the old man's video.
38040,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Oh, that pen and notepad..."
38041,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Huh?
38042,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Can you leave one by the phone \Nin the conference room?
38043,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Oh, there should already be one."
38044,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Oh, never mind, then."
38045,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Is there also a trashcan like this one?
38046,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Yes.
38047,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why do you ask?
38048,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Four...
38049,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"No, eight."
38050,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Read this.
38051,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"These are rules for the election, yes?"
38052,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Yeah.
38053,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,What is this for?
38054,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"In a few days, the Zodiacs will gather here."
38055,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Most likely, there will be a drawing."
38056,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why would you say that?
38057,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If we tried to hold a vote or come to a \Nconsensus, it would take too long."
38058,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Plus, Pariston will be there..."
38059,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"As far as he's concerned,"
38060,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"1 in 12 odds would be acceptable, \Nas long as it might give him an advantage."
38061,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Either way, it's a win for him."
38062,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,And everyone else will think \Ntheir odds are 5 in 6...
38063,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That basically guarantees a drawing.
38064,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I expect Cheadle will propose it.
38065,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Saccho may protest.
38066,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Piyon would be a long shot.
38067,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Kanzai would be a really long shot...
38068,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,And they'll ask me to hold the drawing?
38069,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There's no one else.
38070,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Everyone else in this building supports Pariston.
38071,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If these rules look acceptable, fold it three \Ntimes, and keep it until the meeting."
38072,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If they don't ask for you or if \NI fold my paper differently,"
38073,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"I'll look at the floor, and you should \Nburn that piece of paper."
38074,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"In my opinion, if you're willing \Nto become Chairman..."
38075,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"No, that won't happen."
38076,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Zero chance.
38077,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Sorry.
38078,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm not doing this because I \Nwant to change the result.
38079,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.
38080,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm not looking for any trouble.
38081,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,But what about Rule #5?
38082,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's a decoy.
38083,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If I leave that as Rule #5, it'll give people pause."
38084,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"And if I agree to concede that rule, they'll be more ready to accept the rest."
38085,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This is how criminals con people.
38086,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's nothing special.
38087,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If Rule #5 passes, I'll resign."
38088,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ging-san, why do this if you don't want to change the result?"
38089,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's a strange question to ask.
38090,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If I can get my target to move as I want,"
38091,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I've succeeded as a Hunter.
38092,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I just want to enjoy the process.
38093,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That's all.
38094,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The election committee was composed \Nof the twelve Zodiacs.
38095,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Cluck, one of the Zodiacs, \Nsent ballots to every Hunter."
38096,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The election for the 13th Chairman...
38097,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The Hunter Association has 661 members.
38098,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Which means that is the number of candidates.
38099,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Each Hunter must bring their own ballot.
38100,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ballots may only be entered when at least three committee members are present, \Nand identification has been verified."
38101,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The voting takes place in the Hunter \NAssociation headquarters.

38103,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The vote will take place from 12:00 AM on August 8th \Nto 11:59:59 PM on August 8th.
38104,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This will not change.
38105,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Any voting that occurs away from headquarters \Nmust follow this schedule.
38106,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Votes will be tallied the same day.
38107,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"And it is now August 8th, 12:00 AM."
38108,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The vote begins.
38109,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,May I put it in?
38110,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,This is a surprise.
38111,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I wouldn't think a murderer would be interested \Nin such an ordinary event.
38112,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Eighty-five points.
38113,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Yes, I'm not interested."
38114,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,See? It's blank.
38115,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Then why are you here?
38116,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ninety points...
38117,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Is someone named Ging here?
38118,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'd like to speak to him.
38119,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,He's already gone...
38120,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,He said the next time we see \Nhim here will be at the runoff.
38121,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Why don't you take your paper and leave?
38122,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Seventy-seven points.
38123,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Okay.
38124,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Heart {\c&H404343&

38126,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Get lost! Aren't you done here?
38127,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,He's assessing the goods.
38128,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ten points, twenty points, forty-five points."
38129,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Ten points, two points, fifty points, thirty points."
38130,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I guess pro Hunters are still nothing special...
38131,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If I want someone to fight, \Nit'll have to be a Zodiac."
38132,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ninety-five points!

38141,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"As the conditions were not met, \Nthe vote must be redone."
38142,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Hey!
38143,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Can't I take a look?
38144,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,No.
38145,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I'm just curious!
38146,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I won't allow anyone to view the ballots.
38147,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Since I was designated election chairman, this is my decision to make."
38148,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,It's no fun if I can't see who voted for whom!
38149,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Scrooge! Baldy!
38150,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Moron.
38151,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Are you bored?
38152,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,And yourself?
38153,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"So, Hisoka..."
38154,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,You probably don't watch the news.
38155,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,The election was held because \NChairman Netero died.
38156,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Rumors say he died alongside \Nthe mutant Ants he was fighting, and the Association received \Na lot of land in reward."
38157,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Ants?
38158,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,As I thought.
38159,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"A lot's happened around the world, while you were chasing Chrollo."
38160,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"If you'd stopped to think for a moment, you could have fought the \Nchairman or the Ants."
38161,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,That would require stopping to think...
38162,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Maybe you can become my manager?
38163,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Gon and Killua also joined the Ant hunt.
38164,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Gon's on the verge of death, and Killua's \Ngone to speak to our father."
38165,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,What did you say?
38166,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"At this rate, they'll both die."
38167,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Both of them?
38168,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I can't have that happen.
38169,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Illumi, explain clearly."
38170,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,There is actually another \Nyounger Zoldyck brother...
38171,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,I want to get rid of him.
38172,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,"Illumi, Milluki, Killua, Kalluto..."
38173,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Who is the fifth brother they share?
38174,Debate x Among x Zodiacs.,137,Next time: Request x And x Wish.
38175,Request x And x Wish.,138,All I'm doing is furthering the old man's will.
38176,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm not looking for any trouble.
38177,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Ging-san, why do this if you don't want to change the result?"
38178,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If I can get my target to move as I want,"
38179,Request x And x Wish.,138,I've succeeded as a Hunter.
38180,Request x And x Wish.,138,Request x And x Wish
38181,Request x And x Wish.,138,"On August 8th at 12:00 AM, in the Hunter Association main headquarters, the voting to elect Netero's successor, the 13th Chairman, began."
38182,Request x And x Wish.,138,Is Valuable
38183,Request x And x Wish.,138,The rules set by Ging made all of the six hundred and sixty-one members both a candidate and voter.
38184,Request x And x Wish.,138,"On this day, voter turnout was below the required 95%, meaning the vote had to be redone."
38185,Request x And x Wish.,138,1) Pariston \N\N2) Cheadle \N\N3) Ickshonpe \N\N4) Botobai
38186,Request x And x Wish.,138,"However, the second vote"

38189,Request x And x Wish.,138,Invalid — 45                    Absent — 33 \NTurnout — 88.2%
38190,Request x And x Wish.,138,Vote must be retaken because \Nrequirements were not met. and had to be redone again.
38191,Request x And x Wish.,138,Taking the results from the \Ntwo votes into consideration...
38192,Request x And x Wish.,138,"First, we will have Beans-san review all ballots before they are entered, to reduce \Nthe number of invalid votes."
38193,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Second,"
38194,Request x And x Wish.,138,Hunters who violate the rules by \Nabstaining or submitting invalid votes will have their licenses temporarily taken away.
38195,Request x And x Wish.,138,Those are my two suggestions.
38196,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If we implement the first, \Ndo we still need the second?"
38197,Request x And x Wish.,138,Just getting rid of the invalid \Nvotes would put us over 95%.
38198,Request x And x Wish.,138,I wouldn't be so sure...
38199,Request x And x Wish.,138,Some Hunters may play hooky when they \Nlearn they can't submit invalid votes.
38200,Request x And x Wish.,138,There are those who would trample \Non the former chairman's wishes.
38201,Request x And x Wish.,138,What?
38202,Request x And x Wish.,138,Drop it. You'll only waste time.
38203,Request x And x Wish.,138,Oh? Did I say something wrong?
38204,Request x And x Wish.,138,"The former chairman declared that \Na 95% turnout was required, so Hunters who submit invalid votes or \Nwon't vote are betraying his memory."
38205,Request x And x Wish.,138,They just don't want to see you become chairman!
38206,Request x And x Wish.,138,Then they should vote for someone else.
38207,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm sure there are other qualified candidates.
38208,Request x And x Wish.,138,Though that isn't how the majority of Hunters feel...
38209,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Is that too hard for you, with your limited \Nvocabulary and math skills?"
38210,Request x And x Wish.,138,I told you that you'd only waste time.
38211,Request x And x Wish.,138,"You get a warning, Kanzai."
38212,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Before adding new rules, \NI believe we should broadcast each candidate's message."
38213,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Besides, abstaining and submitting invalid \Nvotes are not technically violations."
38214,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I fully agree with your first statement, but the second makes me \Nwonder if I heard right..."
38215,Request x And x Wish.,138,I cannot believe those words came from one of the former chairman's leading supporters.
38216,Request x And x Wish.,138,The former chairman said that the difficulty of this election was D-rank.
38217,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Which means, for us Hunters with stars, \Nthis should be a simple task."
38218,Request x And x Wish.,138,"In other words, the former chairman \Ntrusted us to handle this."
38219,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Pariston, you're a pain!"
38220,Request x And x Wish.,138,Don't talk! Keep your mouth shut!
38221,Request x And x Wish.,138,The difficulty level is just his way of \Nexpressing his degree of trust in the Zodiacs.
38222,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If it's S, he's encouraging us."
38223,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If it's F, he's challenging us."
38224,Request x And x Wish.,138,"You can spin it however you want, but abstaining and submitting invalid \Nvotes don't violate any rules, scumbag."
38225,Request x And x Wish.,138,When I called them violations...
38226,Request x And x Wish.,138,I was only insinuating that those \NHunters are mistaken in their manner of paying respects to the former chairman.
38227,Request x And x Wish.,138,The message is that making the election \Na success would be the right way to pay our respects to him.
38228,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, say that during your speech!"
38229,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If you make it a rule, that's coercion!"
38230,Request x And x Wish.,138,Is coercion such a bad thing?
38231,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Okay, I get the idea..."
38232,Request x And x Wish.,138,That's enough.
38233,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm fine with both suggestions.
38234,Request x And x Wish.,138,"My reasons are different than yours, but I agree that, barring \Nextraordinary circumstances, no Hunters should be abstaining \Nor submitting invalid votes."
38235,Request x And x Wish.,138,Then let's take a vote.
38236,Request x And x Wish.,138,First things first.
38237,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I hope you aren't going to say that, \Nduring that time, Hunters who have their licenses taken away \Naren't considered pro Hunters."
38238,Request x And x Wish.,138,"You aren't that stupid, are you?"
38239,Request x And x Wish.,138,Of course not...
38240,Request x And x Wish.,138,I wouldn't think of using such underhanded \Nlogic to manipulate the vote.
38241,Request x And x Wish.,138,Their licenses will be confiscated. Nothing more.
38242,Request x And x Wish.,138,What if they're lost?
38243,Request x And x Wish.,138,"A Hunter who has lost his license may be protected by the rules, but is not qualified to be a pro \Nas far as we're concerned, yes?"
38244,Request x And x Wish.,138,Uh...
38245,Request x And x Wish.,138,Are you saying that someone would use the threat of a license going \Nmissing to manipulate the vote?
38246,Request x And x Wish.,138,We can't guarantee no one will do that.
38247,Request x And x Wish.,138,Let this be clearly recorded in the minutes...
38248,Request x And x Wish.,138,Hunters who lose their licenses during the election will not lose their right to vote.
38249,Request x And x Wish.,138,"That way, no one can manipulate \Nthe turnout or the majority."
38250,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I hate to admit it, but unless we do something about \Nthe majority, not just the turnout,"
38251,Request x And x Wish.,138,Pariston will keep smiling.
38252,Request x And x Wish.,138,"6) Saccho \N7) Ginta \N8) Morel \N9) Piyon, Cluck \N11) Cutie, Sanbica"
38253,Request x And x Wish.,138,"He already seems to have secured the votes that went to Ginta, Piyon, and Cluck."
38254,Request x And x Wish.,138,"6) Saccho \N7) Morel \N8) Cutie, Sanbica, \NTeradein, Bushidora \N12) Loupe"
38255,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If our timing is wrong, there will be casualties."
38256,Request x And x Wish.,138,I hate to admit it...
38257,Request x And x Wish.,138,But some part of me wishes that Ging were here.
38258,Request x And x Wish.,138,A beast that cannot be tamed...
38259,Request x And x Wish.,138,Why did the Chairman select \Nhim as Vice Chairman?
38260,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Since I get to choose my second-in-command, choosing a yes-man wouldn't be any fun."
38261,Request x And x Wish.,138,It should be someone I can't stand...
38262,Request x And x Wish.,138,That is who I want at my side.
38263,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Chairman,"
38264,Request x And x Wish.,138,I still believe you made a mistake.
38265,Request x And x Wish.,138,Young Killua has returned?
38266,Request x And x Wish.,138,That's great...
38267,Request x And x Wish.,138,"When I saw his name on the list of Hunters \Nwho didn't vote, I was worried."
38268,Request x And x Wish.,138,How's he doing?
38269,Request x And x Wish.,138,He's opened Testing Gates 1 through 5?
38270,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Actually, his expression was what concerned me."
38271,Request x And x Wish.,138,He looked very distressed...
38272,Request x And x Wish.,138,I couldn't bring myself to speak to him.
38273,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If you run into his friend there, \Ncan you relay a message?"
38274,Request x And x Wish.,138,Ask him to help young Killua.
38275,Request x And x Wish.,138,Well...
38276,Request x And x Wish.,138,His friend is why he's upset.
38277,Request x And x Wish.,138,What? Gon-kun?
38278,Request x And x Wish.,138,Young Killua...
38279,Request x And x Wish.,138,Let me see Alluka.
38280,Request x And x Wish.,138,I need her power.
38281,Request x And x Wish.,138,Killua...
38282,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I don't have time, Dad!"
38283,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I'll go even if you try to stop me, so come with me."
38284,Request x And x Wish.,138,It's useless.
38285,Request x And x Wish.,138,No one can control Alluka.
38286,Request x And x Wish.,138,That's wrong!
38287,Request x And x Wish.,138,You're wrong... Brother's wrong...
38288,Request x And x Wish.,138,Alluka's a member of the family!
38289,Request x And x Wish.,138,She isn't a machine!
38290,Request x And x Wish.,138,"As her brother, I'm asking her for help!"
38291,Request x And x Wish.,138,For help?
38292,Request x And x Wish.,138,That child is not human.
38293,Request x And x Wish.,138,You shouldn't consider that thing to be a member of the family.
38294,Request x And x Wish.,138,What did you say?
38295,Request x And x Wish.,138,That thing is something that came from somewhere else.
38296,Request x And x Wish.,138,Sit.
38297,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If someone tries to dispel the restriction \Nand covenant Gon set for himself, they'll be either repelled or killed."
38298,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If Alluka hasn't changed,"
38299,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm the only one who can help her.
38300,Request x And x Wish.,138,And Alluka's the only one who can save Gon.
38301,Request x And x Wish.,138,Promise me one thing.
38302,Request x And x Wish.,138,Never betray your friends.
38303,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If I ignore a friend I have the ability to help, \Nwouldn't I be betraying him?"
38304,Request x And x Wish.,138,Come with me.
38305,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I'm sure you already know this, but no new requests have been made."
38306,Request x And x Wish.,138,Who made the last wish?
38307,Request x And x Wish.,138,Milluki.
38308,Request x And x Wish.,138,He asked for the newest computer \Navailable at the time.
38309,Request x And x Wish.,138,"He made the wish himself in Alluka's \Npresence, so he couldn't lie."
38310,Request x And x Wish.,138,A computer shouldn't be that bad...
38311,Request x And x Wish.,138,Was it because Illumi was controlling me?
38312,Request x And x Wish.,138,How could I leave my little \Nsister in this situation?
38313,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Killua, I want to go over this again."
38314,Request x And x Wish.,138,"When making a wish to Alluka, \Nwhat are the rules?"
38315,Request x And x Wish.,138,It's not necessary...
38316,Request x And x Wish.,138,I know Alluka better than anyone.
38317,Request x And x Wish.,138,It's necessary.
38318,Request x And x Wish.,138,Have you forgotten how many people have died?
38319,Request x And x Wish.,138,We've killed more people!
38320,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Killua, if you can't stay calm, we're stopping now."
38321,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Our promise matters to me because \NI care about you, as your father."
38322,Request x And x Wish.,138,Can you go over the rules for me?
38323,Request x And x Wish.,138,Alluka is...
38324,Request x And x Wish.,138,Mitsuba... Mitsuba!
38325,Request x And x Wish.,138,Carry me.
38326,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, yes... I will!"
38327,Request x And x Wish.,138,There!
38328,Request x And x Wish.,138,Climb the stairs!
38329,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, yes."
38330,Request x And x Wish.,138,Raise me up high!
38331,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, yes."
38332,Request x And x Wish.,138,There you go!
38333,Request x And x Wish.,138,Mitsuba...
38334,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, yes? What is it, Master Alluka?"
38335,Request x And x Wish.,138,Yes... Master Alluka's \Nface suddenly changed!
38336,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yeah, it's okay. I can handle this."
38337,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Alluka, lift me up high!"
38338,Request x And x Wish.,138,'Kay.
38339,Request x And x Wish.,138,Up high...
38340,Request x And x Wish.,138,Up high...
38341,Request x And x Wish.,138,'Kay.
38342,Request x And x Wish.,138,See? She's back.
38343,Request x And x Wish.,138,Keep this a secret from everyone.
38344,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Oh, I already told your mother..."
38345,Request x And x Wish.,138,What?
38346,Request x And x Wish.,138,But it was our secret!
38347,Request x And x Wish.,138,It happens after three requests are fulfilled...
38348,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yep, her eyes turn black."
38349,Request x And x Wish.,138,And they turn back after Alluka lifts you up high?
38350,Request x And x Wish.,138,"No, then Alluka grants a wish."
38351,Request x And x Wish.,138,I didn't understand at first...
38352,Request x And x Wish.,138,"So I wished for her to tell me \Nhow to turn her eyes back, and Alluka told me."
38353,Request x And x Wish.,138,Do you remember the exact words Alluka said?
38354,Request x And x Wish.,138,"After she grants a wish, her eyes turn white."
38355,Request x And x Wish.,138,"And when three of her requests \Nare fulfilled, they turn black."
38356,Request x And x Wish.,138,Refuse any requests that Alluka makes.
38357,Request x And x Wish.,138,No matter how small they are.
38358,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, I understand."
38359,Request x And x Wish.,138,Mitsuba... Carry me!
38360,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I can't do that, Master."
38361,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, Mitsuba, shake my hand."
38362,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Oh, um..."
38363,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I can't do that, Master."
38364,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm sorry.
38365,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then I want a piggyback ride, Mitsuba."
38366,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm sorry... I can't.
38367,Request x And x Wish.,138,What should I do?
38368,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Come on, Master!"
38369,Request x And x Wish.,138,Let's go catch some bugs.
38370,Request x And x Wish.,138,Okay?
38371,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, Mitsuba, lift me up high."
38372,Request x And x Wish.,138,"I can't do that, either, Mast—"
38373,Request x And x Wish.,138,Mitsuba was in the play area...
38374,Request x And x Wish.,138,Hasamu was in the butlers' quarters.
38375,Request x And x Wish.,138,"So two people, in different locations, were instantly crushed at the same time..."
38376,Request x And x Wish.,138,What is happening?
38377,Request x And x Wish.,138,It's because she refused.
38378,Request x And x Wish.,138,She refused four of Alluka's requests.
38379,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yasuha, piggyback ride!"
38380,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, Master."
38381,Request x And x Wish.,138,Master Alluka...
38382,Request x And x Wish.,138,Can you make me a millionaire?
38383,Request x And x Wish.,138,'Kay.
38384,Request x And x Wish.,138,'Kay.
38385,Request x And x Wish.,138,"There has been a mysterious incident \Nin which an airship transporting money suddenly went missing, and when it \Nwas found, all the money was gone."
38386,Request x And x Wish.,138,The pilot and crew members have \Nprovided baffling explanations.
38387,Request x And x Wish.,138,It will take a while to determine the cause.
38388,Request x And x Wish.,138,I'm very sorry!
38389,Request x And x Wish.,138,I couldn't help myself...
38390,Request x And x Wish.,138,I find it hard to believe that \Nthis was just a coincidence.
38391,Request x And x Wish.,138,When Alluka is with us...
38392,Request x And x Wish.,138,He never makes any requests.
38393,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Dad, can you let me choose the next butler?"
38394,Request x And x Wish.,138,So your mission is to fulfill Alluka's requests.
38395,Request x And x Wish.,138,Yes... I understand.
38396,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If you clear this mission, \NI will spare you and your lover."
38397,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Hey, Kasuga..."
38398,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Yes, what is it?"
38399,Request x And x Wish.,138,Give me your liver.
38400,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Um, that's not..."
38401,Request x And x Wish.,138,You know?
38402,Request x And x Wish.,138,You won't do it?
38403,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, Kasuga, give me your duodenum."
38404,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Please wait, Master..."
38405,Request x And x Wish.,138,Let's play a different game! Okay?
38406,Request x And x Wish.,138,You won't do it?
38407,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, Kasuga, give me your spine."
38408,Request x And x Wish.,138,Master!
38409,Request x And x Wish.,138,Master... Please...
38410,Request x And x Wish.,138,"Then, Kasuga..."
38411,Request x And x Wish.,138,Give me your brain.
38412,Request x And x Wish.,138,"When three of Alluka's requests are \Nfulfilled, she'll grant one wish."
38413,Request x And x Wish.,138,There probably isn't any limit \Nto the wishes she can grant.
38414,Request x And x Wish.,138,My guess is that she can grant any wish.
38415,Request x And x Wish.,138,Wish
38416,Request x And x Wish.,138,But the bigger the wish she grants...
38417,Request x And x Wish.,138,Request 1
38418,Request x And x Wish.,138,Request 1                   Request 2
38419,Request x And x Wish.,138,The bigger the next three requests will be.
38420,Request x And x Wish.,138,Request 3                  Request 1           Request 2
38421,Request x And x Wish.,138,"In other words, an equivalent exchange."
38422,Request x And x Wish.,138,And the sacrifice isn't made by the \None whose wish was granted.
38423,Request x And x Wish.,138,It's the next person who fulfills the requests.
38424,Request x And x Wish.,138,Request 1                             Request 2
38425,Request x And x Wish.,138,"If someone denies four of \NAlluka's requests in a row, that person and their most loved one, meaning a minimum of two people, will die."
38426,Request x And x Wish.,138,"The bigger the wish, the more people \Ndie when the requests aren't fulfilled."
38427,Request x And x Wish.,138,"After that wish, sixty-seven people died, \Nand those are just the ones we knew of."
38428,Request x And x Wish.,138,Thinking of the family that \Nhas been separated...
38429,Request x And x Wish.,138,Thinking of the friend who is dying...
38430,Request x And x Wish.,138,What will Killua do next?
38431,Request x And x Wish.,138,Next time: Alluka x And x Something.
38432,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"While Killua returned to the Zoldyck \Ncompound for a reunion with Alluka, who was locked up deep underground..."
38433,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'd say there were six other cases \Nin which two people died...
38434,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Our mother didn't believe Killua, \Nso that was another pair."
38435,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Another pair died to satisfy her curiosity.
38436,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Even after she was convinced, she sacrificed two more pairs to verify \Nhow the other victims were chosen."
38437,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Then Milluki exchanged the lives of two pairs \Nof tourists for some cheap toys.
38438,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"During that time, there were two major incidents."
38439,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"There were thirteen confirmed deaths in \Nthe first, and sixty-seven in the second."
38440,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Kill him for me.
38441,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Milluki was responsible for the first one.
38442,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I want to be a millionaire.
38443,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yasuha, the butler, was \Nresponsible for the second."
38444,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Alluka x And x Something
38445,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Sure, a few pictures are no problem, Muna-san."
38446,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'm just taking Alluka and Kalluto for a walk.
38447,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Oh, they're my younger brothers."
38448,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Incredible!
38449,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Hey, Muna..."
38450,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Eat this.
38451,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Hmm?
38452,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Huh?
38453,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Oh, sorry..."
38454,Alluka x And x Something.,139,He likes to make requests.
38455,Alluka x And x Something.,139,You only need to refuse.
38456,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Kill him for me.
38457,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Figuring out the tourist incident wasn't easy...
38458,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"But since another butler paid the \Nprice for the butler's incident, it was easy to track down the victims."
38459,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"After investigating, I realized something."
38460,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The criteria that determines who dies is different for more than two people.
38461,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Perhaps there are different \Nrules for when a pair dies, and when many people die."
38462,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Zoldyck butlers are trained in \Na facility on our property.
38463,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"At the exact moment Kasuga died, every butler in her class at that \Nfacility was wrung to death."
38464,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Her head teacher and specialized teachers also died.
38465,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Butlers from other classes...
38466,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Friends from her orphanage...
38467,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Her foster parents and their parents...
38468,Alluka x And x Something.,139,All people she was close to.
38469,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Still, that she liked all of her \Nclassmates was impossible, right?"
38470,Alluka x And x Something.,139,It becomes clear when you look at her \Nhospitalized biological mother.
38471,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Every month, she could only meet \Nher mother for half an hour."
38472,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Records from Kasuga's student days say she \Nloved her mother most in the world.
38473,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"But her mother, in the hospital, survived."
38474,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Well, people change..."
38475,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Love and hate are two sides of the same coin.
38476,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I agree, but that wasn't the case here."
38477,Alluka x And x Something.,139,It wasn't that she began to hate her mother.
38478,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Rather, she found someone she loved more."
38479,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Kasuga had just begun a relationship.
38480,Alluka x And x Something.,139,She'd spent even less time with her lover \Nthan she had with her mother.
38481,Alluka x And x Something.,139,But wait...
38482,Alluka x And x Something.,139,You didn't investigate her past after the fact.
38483,Alluka x And x Something.,139,You chose her to test after learning her past.
38484,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Oh, you could tell?"
38485,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yeah, that's right."
38486,Alluka x And x Something.,139,We used her to confirm our suspicions.
38487,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Since our butlers aren't allowed to \Nhave relationships, or they're killed."
38488,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The first incident made it clear \Nthat this power was dangerous.
38489,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Capable of destroying the Zoldyck \Nfamily, if we didn't understand it."
38490,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"After investigating the first incident \Nand reaching a conclusion, the second incident confirmed it."
38491,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If you fail to grant four of Alluka's requests, you must pay with your life."
38492,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"When the price is two lives, you and the person you love most will die."
38493,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"When more than two must be sacrificed, you and the person you love most will die, along with, in order, those you've \Nspent the most time with."
38494,Alluka x And x Something.,139,So Kasuga's mother didn't die because she \Nhadn't spent enough time with her.
38495,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"And Kasuga's lover died, \Ndespite his short time with her."
38496,Alluka x And x Something.,139,This is a problem.
38497,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Isn't it?
38498,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Killua will make a wish to Alluka, to restore Gon."
38499,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If Killua makes the wish and lets someone else fulfill the requests, there shouldn't be any problem."
38500,Alluka x And x Something.,139,But I'm sure Killua will do things \Nthe other way around.
38501,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Brother!
38502,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Alluka...
38503,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Killua will have someone else make the wish, and will then attempt to fulfill the \Nconsequent requests himself."
38504,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Sorry about leaving you down \Nhere for so long, Alluka."
38505,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'm sorry.
38506,Alluka x And x Something.,139,It's okay! I'm really happy!
38507,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I've missed your scent...
38508,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The leader of the monsters was strong enough \Nto force Netero to resort to the Rose.
38509,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"To defeat one of its subordinates,"
38510,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Gon's restriction and covenant must \Nhave been harder on him than death.
38511,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Restriction                                                                      Covenant
38512,Alluka x And x Something.,139,A wish to reverse that would far exceed \Nthe power of money and medical science.
38513,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The wish will likely be granted.
38514,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"And then, Killua will do whatever \Nhe can to fulfill Alluka's requests."
38515,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Killua will receive requests he cannot fulfill.
38516,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Still, Killua will try his best, and fail halfway."
38517,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Mission failed.
38518,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"The one he loves most, or the \None he's spent most time with..."
38519,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Either way, the restored Gon will still die."
38520,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Huh?
38521,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Huh?
38522,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Oh.
38523,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Am I wrong?
38524,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"When you mentioned that ""both"" would die, were you referring not to Killua and Gon, but to Killua and yourself?"
38525,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yes, that's right."
38526,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I have issues, but you are just as bad."
38527,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"And if things go wrong, it won't only be Killua, Gon, and me."
38528,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Every Zoldyck will die.
38529,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'm thinking that this wish will cost \Ntens of thousands of lives.
38530,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"So you'll probably die, too."
38531,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's why your comment surprised me.
38532,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Oh, this is a problem..."
38533,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Brother, die."
38534,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Okay, sure."
38535,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Bang!
38536,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'll ask Killua to follow proper procedure \Nwhen he makes his wish.
38537,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I want you there, hidden."
38538,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If Killua either refuses, \Nor agrees, but you feel he's lying,"
38539,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I want you to dispose of Alluka.
38540,Alluka x And x Something.,139,He has no combat abilities.
38541,Alluka x And x Something.,139,You can consider him an ordinary child.
38542,Alluka x And x Something.,139,We just don't know where he came from.
38543,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Third Election for the 13th Chairman \N\N1) Pariston — 258 (39%) \N2) Cheadle — 49 \N3) Botobai — 31 \N4) Ickshonpe — 28 \N5) Mizaistom — 27
38544,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"6) Morel — 18 \N7) Teradein — 17 \N8) Saccho — 15 \N9) Sanbica, Bushidora — 14 \N11) Loupe — 11 \N12) Cutie, Biscuit, Linne — 10 \N15) Tsezguerra — 9 \N16) Knov, Kanzai — 6 \N18) Kite, Satotz — 4 \N20) Menchi, 6 others — 3 \N27) Saiyu, 3 others — 2 \N31) Gon, Hanzo, 21 others — 1"
38545,Alluka x And x Something.,139,There were 68 absentees.
38546,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Absentees — 68              Turnout — 89.7%
38547,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The turnout was 89.7%.
38548,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Oh, dear... Oh, dear... Oh, dear."
38549,Alluka x And x Something.,139,This is strange.
38550,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"In the second vote, there were \Nthirty-three absentees."
38551,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"This time, we have sixty-eight absentees."
38552,Alluka x And x Something.,139,More Hunters were absent.
38553,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Is this because they previously \Nsubmitted invalid votes, which is no longer possible?"
38554,Alluka x And x Something.,139,So they chose to put their licenses \Non the line by not voting at all?
38555,Alluka x And x Something.,139,What's going on?
38556,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Why would they go that far?!
38557,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Then it's okay if we take licenses from anyone who's committed both offenses?
38558,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yes, I suppose we have no choice."
38559,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Cluck-san, this is the list."
38560,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Please send them a letter \Nthat says these two things:
38561,Alluka x And x Something.,139,They must bring their licenses to headquarters.
38562,Alluka x And x Something.,139,And that we expect them to explain their absences.
38563,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I don't know...
38564,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Will that really be enough?
38565,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Once they lose their licenses, \Nviolators gain exemption from the rules."
38566,Alluka x And x Something.,139,They no longer need to fear \Nthe penalty for not voting.
38567,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Taking away their licenses was your idea!
38568,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Huh? But we put the proposal to a vote.
38569,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Besides, everyone was against the idea of temporarily stripping them of Hunter status."
38570,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If my goal had been to quickly improve turnout, then I would have agreed."
38571,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yes, he's hard to deal with because he readily accepts \Nsuggestions that hurt him."
38572,Alluka x And x Something.,139,And he'll even propose ideas \Ndisadvantageous to him.
38573,Alluka x And x Something.,139,It's as though he enjoys the obstacles.
38574,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's the one aspect that's \Nsimilar to Chairman Netero.
38575,Alluka x And x Something.,139,And I don't like it!
38576,Alluka x And x Something.,139,So I have a proposal.
38577,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I think the twelve Zodiacs should give a speech before all of the Hunters.
38578,Alluka x And x Something.,139,We must express this election's importance!
38579,Alluka x And x Something.,139,For the Association...
38580,Alluka x And x Something.,139,For humanity...
38581,Alluka x And x Something.,139,For the world!
38582,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Speaking through a screen is no good.
38583,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"We must look each of them in the eye, and let them hear our voices, \Nand feel our souls in person."
38584,Alluka x And x Something.,139,For the sake of the former chairman!
38585,Alluka x And x Something.,139,This is why
38586,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I hate your guts, Pariston!"
38587,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Brother, wake up!"
38588,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Boo!
38589,Alluka x And x Something.,139,You're so good!
38590,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Alluka's power has rules the rest of \Nthe family doesn't know about.
38591,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Brother, let's play shiritori."
38592,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Okay, sure."
38593,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Then...
38594,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I'll start with the ending ""A"" in ""Alluka""!"
38595,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"The one that calls me ""Brother"" is the real Alluka."
38596,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"The one that calls me ""Killua"" is something else."
38597,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Brother, pat my head."
38598,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Sure.
38599,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Killua's being a model big brother.
38600,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's three requests down.
38601,Alluka x And x Something.,139,So a computer was no big deal...
38602,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"S-S-Sorry, Papa..."
38603,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I won't do it again!
38604,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That means Alluka is ready.
38605,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Yep, Killua just has to make his wish."
38606,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Milluki, I want you to go over the rules again."
38607,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Ah, sure."
38608,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'm aware of five rules.
38609,Alluka x And x Something.,139,One.
38610,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"When someone fails to fulfill one of \NAlluka's requests, causing them to reset, the request difficulty returns to level 1."
38611,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's the best time to make a wish to Alluka.
38612,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Two.
38613,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Once Alluka starts making requests to someone, he will not switch his requests \Nto someone different."
38614,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's why I always ensured \Nthat Alluka made a request to a butler before sending \Nhim to you and Mama.
38615,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'd guess Killua did the same thing.
38616,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's why Alluka has never made \Nany requests of you two.
38617,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Three.
38618,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If the person receiving Alluka's requests \Ndies before clearing them all, it's considered a failure, and at least one more will die."
38619,Alluka x And x Something.,139,This was confirmed by experiment.
38620,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Four.
38621,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If he doesn't know someone's name, \NAlluka can't make requests of them."
38622,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Five.
38623,Alluka x And x Something.,139,The same person can't make two wishes in a row.
38624,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's all I know.
38625,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'm not hiding anything from you!
38626,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I swear on the deal we made.
38627,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Why isn't Killua making a wish?
38628,Alluka x And x Something.,139,He probably has some foolish idea...
38629,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If Killua makes a wish now, someone else will have to clean up the mess."
38630,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That makes no sense.
38631,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Can he not save his friend first, and worry about the consequences later?"
38632,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Papa...
38633,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Would his friend be happy to know that many lives were sacrificed to save him?
38634,Alluka x And x Something.,139,No!
38635,Alluka x And x Something.,139,That's what's going through his head.
38636,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Since he's stupid.
38637,Alluka x And x Something.,139,His mind doesn't work the way ours do.
38638,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"That's why you had Illu-nii use \Nhis needles on him, right?"
38639,Alluka x And x Something.,139,He's moving.
38640,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Father, open the door."
38641,Alluka x And x Something.,139,No.
38642,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Make the wish in that room.
38643,Alluka x And x Something.,139,We cannot let you go outside.
38644,Alluka x And x Something.,139,As I thought.
38645,Alluka x And x Something.,139,They don't know about any of these rules.
38646,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Father,"
38647,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I am definitely your son.
38648,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"You called Alluka ""something that \Ncame from somewhere else."""
38649,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Right?
38650,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"I call the black-eyed Alluka ""Something,"" too."
38651,Alluka x And x Something.,139,We're leaving.
38652,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I'll clean up my own mess.
38653,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Something, if we haven't left the mountain in half an hour, kill my mother!"
38654,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Huh? Hey, Killua!"
38655,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If we've left the mountain in half an hour,"
38656,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I want you to kiss me on the cheek.
38657,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Got it?
38658,Alluka x And x Something.,139,'Kay.
38659,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Mama!
38660,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Killua...
38661,Alluka x And x Something.,139,How...
38662,Alluka x And x Something.,139,How can you issue such cruel commands?
38663,Alluka x And x Something.,139,It's magnificent! You've grown up!
38664,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Damn! You're allowed to do that?
38665,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"As long as only one wish is granted, you can give yourself options!"
38666,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Father, open the door."
38667,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"Something is skilled at destroying, \Nbut fixing isn't her forte."
38668,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"When she's fixing, she must touch the target, \Nor her power won't work."
38669,Alluka x And x Something.,139,"If we've left the mountain in half an hour,"
38670,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I want you to kiss me on the cheek.
38671,Alluka x And x Something.,139,I will save both Gon and Alluka!
38672,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Killua's determination to save Gon \Nhas set events in motion.
38673,Alluka x And x Something.,139,And that man returns.
38674,Alluka x And x Something.,139,Next time: Join Battle x And x Open Battle.
38675,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Something is skilled at destroying, \Nbut fixing isn't her forte."
38676,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"When she's fixing, she must touch the target, \Nor her power won't work."
38677,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I will save both Gon and Alluka!
38678,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Join Battle x And x Open Battle
38679,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Impossible...
38680,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There's no way I can remove this!
38681,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,My power is not enough to bear this burden.
38682,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Killua?
38683,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Where are you now? Are you okay?
38684,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yeah, I'm on my way back."
38685,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,How'd it go with Gon?
38686,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,No luck.
38687,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"When we told him about Kite, there was no response on the monitors."
38688,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,A lot of people have dropped by to talk to him.
38689,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,But there's been no reaction.
38690,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Right, I understand."
38691,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I doubt we can heal him with normal measures.
38692,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Wait! Don't be too hasty, Killua."
38693,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"As you said, Gon used a restriction \Nand covenant to temporarily"
38694,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nen{\i0
38695,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nen{\i0
38696,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We can wait until we've exhausted all our \Noptions to resort to riskier measures.
38697,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Oh, sorry. That didn't come out right."
38698,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'm not talking about taking a crazy gamble.
38699,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"In fact, I can guarantee Gon will be healed."
38700,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Let me take care of this.
38701,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nen{\i0
38702,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,But the problem is how I can get there.
38703,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"This time, that will be the biggest challenge."
38704,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Wh-What do you—
38705,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Forgive me, Master Killua."
38706,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Is that you, Gotoh?"
38707,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"I can't let you continue that conversation, \Non the grounds of secrecy."
38708,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I didn't tell him anything secret!
38709,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Not true.
38710,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You said you could guarantee Gon would be healed.
38711,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That was a reference to Master Alluka's power.
38712,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"At the moment, you are still \Njust within Zoldyck property, but outside the boundaries, you are already \Nat alert level 4, so please be careful."
38713,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,So he was waiting for me to give Morel a hint?
38714,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"You're too easy on me, Gotoh."
38715,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I do not understand what you mean.
38716,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Level 4...
38717,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Looks like I pissed off my father.
38718,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"When one's outside alert level is 4, restrictions are placed upon \Nwhat the target can do and say."
38719,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"To enforce this restriction, multiple butlers and family members \Nare assigned to monitor the target."
38720,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Restricted
38721,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If a restriction is violated, the target will immediately be \Ncaptured and returned home,"
38722,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Restricted and the alert will automatically increase to level 5.
38723,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"At level 5, the moment a single step is \Ntaken outside Zoldyck property, the target is captured."
38724,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,What's the reason?
38725,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"The reasons are unauthorized \Nremoval of a classified object, rebelling against your parents, \Nand use of threatening actions."
38726,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Alluka's an object?
38727,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There are three restrictions.
38728,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"First, to protect family secrets, the target may not speak to, or exchange items with, \Nany outsiders without permission."
38729,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"To enforce this, the target is forbidden \Nto carry any communication devices."
38730,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I've already had everything taken away.
38731,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Second, to protect family secrets, the target must stay within one meter \Nof Master Alluka at all times."
38732,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yeah, yeah."
38733,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I don't plan on letting her out of my sight.
38734,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Third, to protect family secrets, you are forbidden from letting any outsiders learn anything about Alluka's power."
38735,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I understand perfectly.
38736,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,So basically...
38737,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This is what I have to do.
38738,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"This way, I don't have to ask permission \Nevery time I do something."
38739,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"While we're traveling, I'll let you \Nhandle all the arrangements!"
38740,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I understand why I am here.
38741,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,But why is Canary here?
38742,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Moron!
38743,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Alluka's a girl.
38744,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I can't trust a lump like you to take care of her!
38745,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There is nothing to worry about.
38746,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We shall also accompany you.
38747,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Master Silva did not believe that two butlers would be enough.
38748,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Tsubone!
38749,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Dad really is pissed...
38750,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It's fine.
38751,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I won't do anything stupid at alert level 4.
38752,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Listen to me, Killua-chan."
38753,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'm not as lenient as your father and Gotoh.
38754,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"A single violation, and I'll take you home."
38755,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nothing will change that.
38756,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If you resist, I'll knock you out."
38757,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Keep that in mind.
38758,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Are we clear?
38759,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Yes! Yes! Yes!
38760,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Tsubone-sensei is the only person in the entire household who \Ncalls Master Killua ""Killua-chan."""
38761,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,No bullying Brother.
38762,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'm sorry...
38763,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Alluka-chama is so kind.
38764,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I won't do it again.
38765,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I just realized something.
38766,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I have trouble dealing with old ladies.
38767,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Do you love your big brother?
38768,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I love him lots!
38769,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Then you should do as he says.
38770,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Okay!
38771,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Master Killua is depending on me.
38772,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"All so he can save his friend, regardless of the risks."
38773,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I will help him!
38774,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Even if it costs me this job or my life.
38775,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I am Amane. It's a pleasure.
38776,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Canary.
38777,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,The pleasure's mine.
38778,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Tsubone!
38779,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Give me the nail of your pinky.
38780,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,She made a request of Tsubone!
38781,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This is the worst time for it!
38782,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Even I don't know when, and of whom, \NSomething's requests will come."
38783,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yes, absolutely."
38784,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Master Killua,"
38785,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I will go into hiding for the time being.
38786,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This means that Master Alluka will not make requests of anyone else.
38787,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Unless I change my mind.
38788,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Do you understand what I mean?
38789,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Of course, I will remain near you at all times."
38790,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I still have more requests...
38791,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,She pulled a fast one!
38792,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It's all right.
38793,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I still have a chance.
38794,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"I won't be able to make a wish, \Nbut I can issue a command!"
38795,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Brother, are you angry?"
38796,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It's okay.
38797,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There's nothing for you to worry about.
38798,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I will save you!
38799,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Yes?
38800,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Yes.
38801,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Yes.
38802,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That's right.
38803,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This is Master Killua's phone.
38804,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"No, I cannot answer that question."
38805,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"I cannot answer that question, either."
38806,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"In that case, you should state your name first."
38807,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Goodbye.
38808,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Who was that?
38809,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It was...
38810,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Hello?
38811,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,My name is Leorio!
38812,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Can you put Killua-kun on the phone?
38813,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Shh!
38814,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Wow, that brings back memories!"
38815,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"It has been quite some time, Master Leorio."
38816,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Huh?
38817,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Oh! I remember!
38818,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It's the coin guy!
38819,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Master Killua is currently on his way \Nthere, accompanied by us."
38820,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yes, to help Master Gon."
38821,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"However, there are strict conditions \Nthat must be met."
38822,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Hey, there..."
38823,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Conditions to save a friend?
38824,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Are you dreaming?
38825,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If you need help waking up, \NI'll speak more loudly!"
38826,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Keep your mouth shut.
38827,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,What did you say?
38828,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Master Killua is risking his life.
38829,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"He's heading to you, against his family's wishes."
38830,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You should know that the Zoldyck \Nfamily is very special.
38831,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We are the ones who set the conditions.
38832,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"So shut up and listen, fool."
38833,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Gotoh...
38834,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Please excuse me.
38835,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Let me talk to him.
38836,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It'll be faster that way.
38837,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Don't worry.
38838,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I won't say anything I'm not supposed to.
38839,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"One violation, and I'll be sent home, right?"
38840,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yo, it's been a while."
38841,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Killua!
38842,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"When you get here, let me talk to that guy."
38843,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Are you okay?
38844,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yeah, but I can't say anything specific."
38845,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I need you to trust me.
38846,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Do as Gotoh says.
38847,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yeah, got it."
38848,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Put him back on.
38849,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'll ask about the conditions.
38850,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Let me talk.
38851,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Uh... Morel-san, was it?"
38852,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"This is my phone, and I'm talking to my buddy, so why should I let you talk?"
38853,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,An excellent question.
38854,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,The answer is to give me the phone.
38855,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,No way. Get lost.
38856,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Very well.
38857,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Then, I have a favor to ask."
38858,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"My guess is that you'll say, ""That isn't possible."""
38859,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"In which case, you should hand over the phone."
38860,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Because I can make it possible.
38861,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Hello?
38862,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"No, it's nothing."
38863,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Tell me the conditions.
38864,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"When we arrive, there must be no one inside \Nthe building except Master Gon."
38865,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Not even doctors?
38866,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Correct.
38867,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Or any other patients?
38868,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Correct.
38869,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That isn't possible!
38870,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This is a national hospital!
38871,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Do you have any idea how \Nmany people are in here?!
38872,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Hello?
38873,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I understand the conditions.
38874,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Leave it to me.
38875,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,What is the plan?
38876,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"This is a big hospital, with a big parking lot."
38877,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We'll set up a private room for Gon there.
38878,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It'll be arranged so you can \Ndrive in and out of the area.
38879,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'll make sure that no one can learn what you do inside.
38880,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Understood.
38881,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That satisfies our requirements.
38882,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,What is your name?
38883,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I'm Morel.
38884,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"From now on, I'd like you to \Nbe the one I speak with."
38885,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There you go.
38886,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Oh, I need to make another call."
38887,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Knov?
38888,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,It's me.
38889,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,The situation's changed.
38890,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I need you to make sure the equipment \Nis operable in an outside room.
38891,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"No, no monitors."
38892,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,And we can't have any windows.
38893,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,True...
38894,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nen{\i0 since they don't want anyone watching.
38895,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,But Killua made it sound like something else.
38896,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Nen {\i0 said Gon was beyond help.
38897,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,But Killua said he could heal him with no risks.
38898,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"No, let's not pursue the matter."
38899,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Killua said to let him take care of it.
38900,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"In the field, the rule is to listen when \Na trusted friend tells you to."
38901,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Morel, I'll let you handle all contact with Killua."
38902,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Yeah, I've got it."
38903,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,What are you going to do?
38904,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,There are several people
38905,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I need to have a word with.
38906,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Gon's fighting for his life...
38907,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Where are you, and what are you doing?"
38908,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Why won't you answer your phone,"
38909,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Kurapika?
38910,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"And so, the Zodiacs respect the \Nformer chairman's wishes."
38911,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"And we've worked diligently to maintain the status quo, and we seek \Nto better the Association."
38912,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Your vote, no matter for whom \Nyou vote, will not go to waste!"
38913,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You can be assured of that.
38914,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"At the same time,"
38915,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"I'm sure that some people are dissatisfied with the current state of the Association, \Nor want to shake up the leadership."
38916,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"However, I must ask that you do not express that opinion \Nby refusing to cast a vote."
38917,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"You are more than welcome to make \Na speech up here, on the spot."
38918,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,All you have to do is speak up.
38919,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We will never seek to smother a minority opinion.
38920,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"We have Ging here, who commits countless violations every year, but still calls himself a member of the Zodiacs."
38921,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If you intend to skip the vote, \Nyou might as well vote for him."
38922,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Ah, that was meant to be a joke."
38923,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,This was the final mission the \Nformer chairman gave us.
38924,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,The entire Association should \Nwork together to clear it!
38925,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Okay, thank you very much, Vice Chairman."
38926,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Please return to your seat.
38927,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Make it quick.
38928,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We now open the floor to everyone here.
38929,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If you'd like to express your views or \Nask a question, raise your hand."
38930,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Okay, the big guy in the dark suit... Go ahead."
38931,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"I'm Leorio, from the 287th class."
38932,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I have a question for that guy named Ging.
38933,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That's Gon's dad.
38934,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Why haven't you gone to visit Gon?
38935,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You must know his current condition!
38936,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"Okay, let's hear the answer."
38937,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"First, what is your relationship to Gon?"
38938,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,We're buddies.
38939,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Oh... I appreciate it.
38940,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I hope you'll stay friends with him.
38941,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That's all.
38942,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Answer my question!
38943,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Or just go visit him!
38944,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Go visit Gon!
38945,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,I've heard he has a number of friends like you.
38946,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,That should suffice.
38947,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Don't give me that bull!
38948,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Do you have any idea how much \NGon wants to see you?
38949,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,"If you talk to him, he might recover!"
38950,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Did he say that he wanted me to visit?
38951,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,He couldn't say it if he wanted to...
38952,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You damned bastard!
38953,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,You can go to hell!
38954,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Wow!

38958,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,And this man never changes.
38959,Join Battle x And x Open Battle.,140,Next time: Magician x And x Butler.
38960,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Wow! entire{\i0 so tell everyone who wasn't present!
38961,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Tell them they absolutely have to watch it!

39017,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You can go to hell!
39018,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Looks like he's an Emitter.
39019,Magician x And x Butler.,141,So do people dislike Gon's dad?
39020,Magician x And x Butler.,141,That was a standing ovation.
39021,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Wow!
39022,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You'll find footage of today's entire meeting...
39023,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Master Illumi...
39024,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Yes, at once."
39025,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Please wait one moment.
39026,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Thanks to Gotoh,"
39027,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I can see it now...
39028,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Our family's correlation chart surrounding Alluka.
39029,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Despite what he says, my father trusts me."
39030,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"That's why Gotoh was allowed to accompany us, and he won't force me to stop."
39031,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"However, he's wary of Alluka's power."
39032,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Which makes sense, given that one wrong move is all it takes for the entire family to die."
39033,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"But on the other hand, \Nhe wishes to control Alluka's power."
39034,Magician x And x Butler.,141,That dilemma shows in his decision to \Nlock her up in a room filled with toys.
39035,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"That's why he had Tsubone and Amane, \Nhis most trusted butlers, accompany us."
39036,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If something happens, they can \Ntake us back immediately."
39037,Magician x And x Butler.,141,And he hopes they'll glean some hint \Nto help him control Alluka.
39038,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Tsubone and Amane understand their role, and they're being very cautious."
39039,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Gotoh and Canary are being subtle, but they're on our side and helping us."
39040,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"And then, there's Illumi."
39041,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"The moment his name was spoken, \NAmane's tension spiked."
39042,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"This means Amane and Tsubone, and Father and Grandpa by extension, disagree with Illumi."
39043,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I'd guess that Illumi's plans for Alluka are...
39044,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"That was a fine play, Gotoh."
39045,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You threw out his name to see Amane's reaction.
39046,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If Tsubone were here, she would have noticed Gotoh's reaction \Nwhen he answered the phone, and she'd have distracted me or signaled \NAmane to shut off her emotions."
39047,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"This is an internal family struggle, an inner mission."
39048,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"When family members differ \Nin opinion or objective, they're each encouraged to do things their \Nown way, rather than unite in the same goal."
39049,Magician x And x Butler.,141,This is a contest!
39050,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Father and Grandpa want Alluka \Nnear, so they can control her, and they don't want me hurt by her power."
39051,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I want to save Gon and to set Alluka free.
39052,Magician x And x Butler.,141,And...
39053,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Illumi wants to kill Alluka!
39054,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Is this Killua?
39055,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Yeah.
39056,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"You removed the needle, didn't you?"
39057,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Yeah.
39058,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I feel a lot better.
39059,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.
39060,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Kill?
39061,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Me?
39062,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You can't kill family members \Nduring an inner mission.
39063,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Family{\i0
39064,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Hey, hey, Amane..."
39065,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Isn't this part great?
39066,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Why is this story so mysterious?
39067,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Is that what
39068,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Father meant?
39069,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You shouldn't consider that thing \Nto be a member of the family.
39070,Magician x And x Butler.,141,They're all thinking the same thing!
39071,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Fine...
39072,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I'll beat you at your own game.
39073,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Then, let's begin."
39074,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Master Killua!
39075,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Don't let go of Master Alluka!
39076,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Yeah, I got her."
39077,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If you two are more than a meter apart,"
39078,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Amane will capture Master Alluka, and Tsubone will take you home by force!"
39079,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Oh, dear."
39080,Magician x And x Butler.,141,That was excessive.
39081,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I thought you were going to ask him first.
39082,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I have a little bird who brings me information.
39083,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"And after examining that information, there's something that bothers me."
39084,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Killua is hiding rules from us.
39085,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If there are rules I don't know about, trying to negotiate with him is pointless."
39086,Magician x And x Butler.,141,He might accede to my demands \Nbecause they favor him.
39087,Magician x And x Butler.,141,So I'll dispose of Alluka before he has \Na chance to use that advantage.
39088,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I just need you to eliminate the butlers while you look for a chance \Nto take Alluka from Killua.
39089,Magician x And x Butler.,141,For now.
39090,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Okay.
39091,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"By the way, am I allowed to kill Killua?"
39092,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I will kill you.
39093,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Right here.
39094,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Right now.
39095,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I was kidding.
39096,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You're oozing bloodlust.
39097,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Is that all right?
39098,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Illumi's bloodlust!
39099,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Oh, damn."
39100,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Was that on purpose?
39101,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Certainly not.
39102,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If at all possible, I'd like Gon to live."
39103,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Having more toys is always more amusing.
39104,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Well, only if it's possible."
39105,Magician x And x Butler.,141,It's okay. Brother's got you.
39106,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Keep your eyes closed and hold on tight.
39107,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Uh-huh.
39108,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Try to stay away from Master Illumi.
39109,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If he knows the route we're taking, \Nit's best to change directions."
39110,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I concur, but..."
39111,Magician x And x Butler.,141,It's hard for me to agree with you.
39112,Magician x And x Butler.,141,My grandmother and I are not your enemies.
39113,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Not right now.
39114,Magician x And x Butler.,141,But that could change if my \Nfather's mood changes.
39115,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Master Silva and Master Zeno \Nare not your enemies.
39116,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Our mission is to bring you home safely.
39117,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If that doesn't include Alluka, you're all enemies."
39118,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Godspeed!
39119,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Speed of Lightning!
39120,Magician x And x Butler.,141,It's me. The situation's changed.
39121,Magician x And x Butler.,141,We've been separated from Master Killua.
39122,Magician x And x Butler.,141,We'll need four vehicles now.
39123,Magician x And x Butler.,141,We'll follow the same route.
39124,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If Master Killua contacts you, follow his instructions, but avoid \Nany sensitive information."
39125,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Master Illumi is aware of our movements.
39126,Magician x And x Butler.,141,One of the butlers or a family \Nmember is helping him.
39127,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Be sure to stay alert.
39128,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Understood.
39129,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Ah...
39130,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"You've grown, Master."
39131,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If I hadn't known about that \Ntechnique beforehand,"
39132,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I wouldn't have had time to react.
39133,Magician x And x Butler.,141,He will become an excellent assassin.
39134,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Oh, dear. These days, it doesn't \Ntake much for me to tear up."
39135,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"In that case, he won't let Master \NIllumi get the better of him."
39136,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I shouldn't say that.
39137,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"But I find it difficult to like Master Illumi and Master Milluki, who resemble their mother."
39138,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"Now, then..."
39139,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Time to set aside personal emotion.
39140,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If he breaks the rules, everything changes."
39141,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I need to devise a way to subdue Master Killua, taking his speed into account."
39142,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Okay! We should be far enough \Naway to take a break.
39143,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I'd like to use Speed of Lightning to keep going, but to be safe, I should save my \Nenergy for getting into town."
39144,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Brother?
39145,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Am I a nuisance?
39146,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"If I were gone, would everyone get along better?"
39147,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Alluka.
39148,Magician x And x Butler.,141,If...
39149,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I were the only person in the \Nworld who really loved you, would you be sad?"
39150,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling."
39151,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Okay?
39152,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I'll always be with you!
39153,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You don't need to worry about anyone else.
39154,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Someone's there.
39155,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Is it Tsubone?
39156,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Is it Illumi?
39157,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I guess this won't be easy.
39158,Magician x And x Butler.,141,That's fine!
39159,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Let's go.
39160,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Who are you?
39161,Magician x And x Butler.,141,A magician who wishes to stay anonymous.
39162,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You two shouldn't be trying to fight back.
39163,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Just evade his attacks.
39164,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Save your energy for the mission at hand.
39165,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You should follow Master Killua.
39166,Magician x And x Butler.,141,I'll play with you.
39167,Magician x And x Butler.,141,A power that lets you rapidly fire coins \Nwith more power than bullets...
39168,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Your power is strong enough to explain why \Nyou'd send your subordinates away.
39169,Magician x And x Butler.,141,My coins pack enough power that you \Ncan't escape unscathed if they hit.
39170,Magician x And x Butler.,141,He must have used his power.
39171,Magician x And x Butler.,141,My aura possesses the qualities \Nof both gum and rubber.
39172,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Elastic Love \NBungee Gum
39173,Magician x And x Butler.,141,You've said too much.
39174,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!"
39175,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Telling my name to someone \Nabout to die is pointless.
39176,Magician x And x Butler.,141,It doesn't matter that you \Nknow what my power is.
39177,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Hisoka and Gotoh are about to engage in battle.
39178,Magician x And x Butler.,141,A barrage of coins.
39179,Magician x And x Butler.,141,A net of gum.
39180,Magician x And x Butler.,141,"While a furious battle takes place,"
39181,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Illumi pursues the fleeing Killua.
39182,Magician x And x Butler.,141,Next time: Needles x And x Debt.
39183,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"You removed the needle, didn't you?"
39184,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Yeah.
39185,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I feel a lot better.
39186,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Then I won't have to hold back when I kill you.
39187,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Kill?
39188,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Me?
39189,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You can't kill family members \Nduring an inner mission.
39190,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Family{\i0
39191,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You shouldn't consider that thing \Nto be a member of the family.
39192,Needles x And x Debt.,142,They're all thinking the same thing!
39193,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Fine...
39194,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I'll beat you at your own game.
39195,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Needles x And x Debt
39196,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"To save Gon, Killua is heading \Nfor the city with Alluka."
39197,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Hisoka, who is working with Illumi to kill Alluka, confronted Gotoh and the other \Nbutlers escorting them."
39198,Needles x And x Debt.,142,A power that lets you rapidly fire coins \Nwith more power than bullets...
39199,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Your power is strong enough to explain why \Nyou'd send your subordinates away.
39200,Needles x And x Debt.,142,My coins pack enough power that you \Ncan't escape unscathed if they hit.
39201,Needles x And x Debt.,142,He must have used his power.
39202,Needles x And x Debt.,142,My aura possesses the qualities \Nof both gum and rubber.
39203,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You've said too much.
39204,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"I hope you don't regret it, you hack magician!"
39205,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Telling my name to someone \Nabout to die is pointless.
39206,Needles x And x Debt.,142,It doesn't matter that you \Nknow what my power is.
39207,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Rubbish!
39208,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Catch.
39209,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Were my eyes just accustomed \Nto your attack that time?
39210,Needles x And x Debt.,142,It looked slower.
39211,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Yeah, it was a lot slower."
39212,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Because I diverted some \Npower to make them spin.
39213,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If you don't release your ability, \Nyou'll be strangled by your own aura."
39214,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Or would you prefer your body riddled with holes?
39215,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Pick your poison.
39216,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Bungee Gum, undo."
39217,Needles x And x Debt.,142,He dodged my attack from that position?
39218,Needles x And x Debt.,142,He's fast.
39219,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I can't follow him!
39220,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I sent my gum out with the first card...
39221,Needles x And x Debt.,142,So it would be ready to activate anytime after I removed the gum from my feet.
39222,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Now, this evil magician has a lethal pop quiz for you."
39223,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I took twenty-two coins from your attack.
39224,Needles x And x Debt.,142,How many coins will I return to you?
39225,Needles x And x Debt.,142,He's going to use the gum to send \Nthe coins flying back at me?
39226,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You will have to find out for yourself.
39227,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Gum, undo."
39228,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You shouldn't underestimate me.
39229,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Even if the answer is greater than twenty-two,"
39230,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I'll shoot them all down!
39231,Needles x And x Debt.,142,The answer is enough to kill you.
39232,Needles x And x Debt.,142,A lethal pop quiz doesn't \Nneed to be answered.
39233,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Forty kilometers until we reach the next town.
39234,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I should last that long...
39235,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Alluka, you're gonna feel a little zap again."
39236,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Okay, it's fine."
39237,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Godspeed!
39238,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Speed of Lightning!
39239,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Very impressive...
39240,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If he runs at that speed on pavement, \NI won't be able to catch up on my own."
39241,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Amane, it's me."
39242,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Master Killua is headed for Parasta.
39243,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I need you to follow the road.
39244,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Canary, come with me."
39245,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"With my grandmother's motorcycle, \Nit'll be faster with two riders."
39246,Needles x And x Debt.,142,This is...
39247,Needles x And x Debt.,142,My grandmother.
39248,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Hang on tight.
39249,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"We'll be using our auras as fuel, so this will be more tiring than if you were to run."
39250,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Be prepared.
39251,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Here we go.
39252,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Found them.
39253,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Seriously?
39254,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"I know I'm carrying Alluka, but Speed of Lightning is at full power!"
39255,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Damn!
39256,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If I go this way, you can't follow on a motorcycle!"
39257,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What now?
39258,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We'll beat him there.
39259,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Beat him where?
39260,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"At Master Killua's speed, it'll take less \Nthan ten minutes to reach Parasta."
39261,Needles x And x Debt.,142,It'll take Master Illumi over twenty minutes by car.
39262,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What will he do with his ten-minute lead?
39263,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Disguise himself?
39264,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Wrong. Cute answer...
39265,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Though not impossible, I suppose."
39266,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What's the first thing Master Killua \Nwill want to do after he loses us?
39267,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Contact his friends.
39268,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Bingo.
39269,Needles x And x Debt.,142,And how can he contact his friends \Nwithout us finding out?
39270,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Um...
39271,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"He'll need to check for any \Ntracing or listening devices, and use someone else's phone."
39272,Needles x And x Debt.,142,That's mere common sense.
39273,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Think about what matters in this situation!
39274,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"We may know where Master Killua is, but if we can't get near him, \Nwe won't know what he's doing."
39275,Needles x And x Debt.,142,So where is he going?
39276,Needles x And x Debt.,142,You've figured it out?
39277,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Let's go, then!"
39278,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We've been waiting for you.
39279,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Damn, you guys aren't bad."
39280,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We've already prepared an airship.
39281,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Great, how many?"
39282,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Huh?
39283,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Sounds like you only have one.
39284,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Are you serious about this?
39285,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Without at least five or six airships heading \Nto different places, we'll never lose Illumi!"
39286,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Split up, and make the arrangements."
39287,Needles x And x Debt.,142,This airship will take us to our destination.
39288,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Is that okay?
39289,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Yes.
39290,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"We'll have to pay for two tickets, \Nor they'll figure out it's unmanned."
39291,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I know that! Do you take me for a fool?
39292,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What does this say?
39293,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Ask the clerk.
39294,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What names should we put the tickets under?
39295,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Look, can't you do anything by yourself?"
39296,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Where's Master Killua?
39297,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Crap!
39298,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Hey! You were pestering me as a distraction, \Nweren't you? You helped them escape!"
39299,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What are you talking about?
39300,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We have to follow them!
39301,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I'll let you handle that.
39302,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Once I've dispatched the other \Nflights, I'll ride one of them."
39303,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If you follow them on the ground, \Nbe sure you aren't followed."
39304,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What are you talking about?
39305,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If you follow them by air, it'll be more obvious!"
39306,Needles x And x Debt.,142,That wasn't my plan.
39307,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I can serve as a decoy.
39308,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"And since I plan to join up with Gotoh, \Nit'll be easier to move by airship."
39309,Needles x And x Debt.,142,What is it?
39310,Needles x And x Debt.,142,The real you is pretty cute.
39311,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I'm sure that Master Killua will \Nlike you more that way.
39312,Needles x And x Debt.,142,A-Are you making fun of me?
39313,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Nope.
39314,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I really mean it.
39315,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Gotoh...
39316,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Hello? It's me, Killua."
39317,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Oh, what happened?"
39318,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I was getting worried.
39319,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I can't get in touch with Gotoh-san.
39320,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Got it. I'll try calling him.
39321,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Your older brother wants to \Nkill your younger brother?
39322,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Yeah.
39323,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Alluka's the only one who can heal Gon.
39324,Needles x And x Debt.,142,But Illumi wants to kill Alluka.
39325,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Because he thinks that my wish may \Nend up wiping out the entire family.
39326,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We were too late...
39327,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Why don't we just wait for \Nthem around the hospital?
39328,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"The closer we get to the hospital, \Nthe more likely we are to fail."
39329,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Killua's friends will be in the vicinity.
39330,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"And if we just hang around waiting, \Nthey'll realize something isn't right."
39331,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Eight... We need more people.
39332,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Will you bring in more allies?
39333,Needles x And x Debt.,142,But I'm pretty shy...
39334,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"No, I have no more allies."
39335,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Seems like a waste, but I guess I'll use my needles."
39336,Needles x And x Debt.,142,That's some nice aura.
39337,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If I stick them in someone and give orders, \Nthey'll work hard for me until death."
39338,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Though, they usually die from working too hard."
39339,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Grant a wish?
39340,Needles x And x Debt.,142,That's a pretty scary power.
39341,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If segregationists knew about \Nthat, they'd be all over it."
39342,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Illumi will probably follow the airships by ground.
39343,Needles x And x Debt.,142,My butlers have dispatched seven decoys.
39344,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"My brother doesn't usually rely on others, so he'll probably use Needlemen."
39345,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Needlemen?
39346,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Nen{\i0 to create soldiers that fight to the death for him.
39347,Needles x And x Debt.,142,He sacrifices ordinary civilians to do it.
39348,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Illumi's powerful aura enters \Nthe victims through the needles, so the moment they're pierced, \Nthey turn into vegetables."
39349,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Morel, I need you to get some Hunters to take the Needlemen into custody."
39350,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If we have proof that he's harmed \Nmultiple innocent civilians beyond recovery, then it's okay to hunt him down, \Neven if he's a pro Hunter, right?"
39351,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Killua sought this confirmation because of \Nwhat the fourth Hunter Commandment said.
39352,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Hunter Commandment #4...
39353,Needles x And x Debt.,142,A Hunter may never target another Hunter.
39354,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"However, this does not apply to Hunters \Nwho commit heinous criminal acts."
39355,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I believe some of the candidates were talking about changing the Commandments and Hunter Exam.
39356,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If we catch Illumi, a lot of people who agree with \Nthose views will come forward."
39357,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Killua, are you really going to sell your brother out?"
39358,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt Alluka.
39359,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Not even if he's my own brother.
39360,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I'll do whatever it takes to crush him.
39361,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I understand.
39362,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Teradein and Bushidora will \Nprobably agree to help.
39363,Needles x And x Debt.,142,There should be many Hunters \Nwho will gladly lend a hand.
39364,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Since you're coming to the city \Nwhere the Hunter Association HQ is, you'll be right under our noses."
39365,Needles x And x Debt.,142,But I'll make sure everyone understands \Nhow dangerous our opponent is.
39366,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"The mission will be to secure the \NNeedlemen, not to go after Illumi."
39367,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Yeah, that's fine."
39368,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I've accessed Parasta Airport's flight records.
39369,Needles x And x Debt.,142,There are six airships landing within twenty \Nto thirty kilometers of the hospital.
39370,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We don't know where Killua \Nand his butlers will land.
39371,Needles x And x Debt.,142,And Illumi can't pursue what he can't see.
39372,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Illumi and the Needlemen will try to \Nstay in visual range of the airships, as they follow on the ground."
39373,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"They will be vulnerable to attack \Nat a number of points before they reach Swaldani City, where the hospital is."
39374,Needles x And x Debt.,142,So we need to send Hunters to those points.
39375,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Our top priority is recovering the Needlemen.
39376,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We can confirm if there are needles afterward.
39377,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Capture anyone who approaches the airship!
39378,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Yes, sir!"
39379,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Be on your way!
39380,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Go!
39381,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Hisoka, can you dispose of the fakes for me?"
39382,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Okay.
39383,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I will be busy.
39384,Needles x And x Debt.,142,I always knew the fourth Commandment \Nwas fundamentally wrong.
39385,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We can't wait for a villain like this to appear!
39386,Needles x And x Debt.,142,The Association's honor will be sullied.
39387,Needles x And x Debt.,142,The exam needs to be more strict.
39388,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"If they were required to behave \Nproperly before joining, we wouldn't have this problem."
39389,Needles x And x Debt.,142,So the time has come...
39390,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"For the three of us, the anti-chairman faction, to leave the Association."
39391,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Heart {\c&H404343&
39392,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Hello, everyone."
39393,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Today, I—Teradein—Loupe, and \NBushidora have joined forces."
39394,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"We three are commonly known \Nas the anti-chairman faction, but that is not a name of our choice."
39395,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"The Hunter souls within us were inherited \Nfrom the former chairman, I assure you."
39396,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"And so, to carry out his will, we seek to reform the highly versatile team \Nto which the former chairman belonged,"
39397,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Seirin Group the legendary Seirin Group.
39398,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Teradein, the leader."
39399,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Loupe, the second-in-command."
39400,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"And I, Bushidora, will serve \Nas captain of the troops."
39401,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"In this election, as an expression of our solidarity, we request that all votes go \Nto Teradein, the leader."
39402,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We hope that everyone who agrees with our message will vote \Nfor our comrade Teradein.
39403,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Now, as we address our message, we have received trustworthy \Ninformation from a reliable source stating that multiple parties have found \Na certain Hunter guilty of many foul crimes."
39404,Needles x And x Debt.,142,We are currently pursuing this Hunter.
39405,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"Ladies and gentlemen, let us come together to rebuild the \NHunter Association with wisdom and integrity!"
39406,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"And so, the conflict within \Nthe Zoldyck family over Alluka grows in intensity as it now involves \Nthe Hunter Association chairman election."
39407,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Teradein and his allies seek \Nto control the Association.
39408,Needles x And x Debt.,142,"As the election continues, \NIllumi manages to capture Killua."
39409,Needles x And x Debt.,142,Next time: Sin x And x Claw.
39410,Sin x And x Claw.,143,5th Election for the 13th Chairman
39411,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"In the fifth vote in the election \Nfor the 13th chairman,"
39412,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"6) Botobai — 26 \N7) Mizaistom — 21 \N8) Morel — 20 \N9) Biscuit — 18 \N10) Saccho — 16 \N11) Linne — 15 \N12) Cutie — 10 \N13) Ging — 7 \N14) Sanbica — 3 \N15) Loupe, Bushidora — 0 \N\NValid Votes: 633 (28 Absentees) \NTurnout: 95.8%"
39413,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Pariston placed first.
39414,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"But since he didn't receive \Nthe majority of the valid votes,"
39415,Sin x And x Claw.,143,1) Pariston — 274 (41.4%) \N2) Teradein — 77\N3) Cheadle — 63 \N4) Leorio — 55 \N5) Ickshonpe — 28 those in the top eight must hold a runoff.
39416,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What? Talk about my loss?
39417,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Cutie Beauty
39418,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I haven't lost.
39419,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Our beloved Pariston will bring my dream \Nof a cutiful Hunter Association to life.
39420,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Biscuit Krueger
39421,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yeah, that old man..."
39422,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I mean, Netero..."
39423,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'm sure everyone knows \Nhow crazy he could be.
39424,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But there's one thing I can say.
39425,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Just like in the battle with the Ants, you can't escape danger just \Nby being good all the time!"
39426,Sin x And x Claw.,143,That's a fact!
39427,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Ging Freecss
39428,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Saccho Kobayakawa
39429,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Well...
39430,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'll continue to support the \NAssociation behind the scenes.
39431,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I won't proffer any names, but I hope you vote for someone worth supporting."
39432,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Sanbica Norton
39433,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I would like to thank all \Nthose who voted for me...
39434,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But please stop...
39435,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Linne Hors-d'oeuvre
39436,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Sin x And x Claw
39437,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yes, hello?"
39438,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Somehow,"
39439,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I managed to obtain a map.
39440,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It has routes and destinations for all six airships.
39441,Sin x And x Claw.,143,They seem to be on one of \Nthe two remaining airships.
39442,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Want me to send a picture?
39443,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I'll be using Texture Surprise to \Nchange it a little, though."
39444,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It's okay.
39445,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"An idiot over here was carrying the map, too."
39446,Sin x And x Claw.,143,And I already know which airship Killua took.
39447,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Okay.
39448,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Oh, right... He has a spotter."
39449,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Someone's watching me?
39450,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I don't think I'm so senile that someone \Ncould tail me when I'm tailing another.
39451,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Since the mission began, I've felt eyes on me."
39452,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"They're quite far away, \Nyet I can't shake them off."
39453,Sin x And x Claw.,143,This is the first time that's happened.
39454,Sin x And x Claw.,143,This person must be very good...
39455,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Amane, come here!"
39456,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We're going to fly!
39457,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Yes!
39458,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Fortunately, it appears that \Nclouds have come out tonight."
39459,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Master Killua is sure to use \Nthat to his advantage.
39460,Sin x And x Claw.,143,As expected...
39461,Sin x And x Claw.,143,You're late. Let's go!
39462,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Yes!
39463,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone's power, known as Rider's High, allows her to transform herself \Ninto various different vehicles."
39464,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"However, the vehicles are \Nfueled by the rider's aura, so she cannot use her power alone."
39465,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"When we're above the clouds, no one can watch us from the ground, \Nno matter how strong the scope."
39466,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Amane, if there are any suspicious aircraft \Naround, we'll take them down."
39467,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Yes!
39468,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Well...
39469,Sin x And x Claw.,143,There's still time before either ship will land.
39470,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'll help Hisoka out a bit longer.
39471,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Nothing out of the ordinary here.
39472,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The target has yet to appear.
39473,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We've lost all contact with Point C!
39474,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Nothing has happened at Point A.
39475,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Should we tell them to send support?
39476,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We can't assume that Point A is safe.
39477,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Illumi manipulates others with his needles.
39478,Sin x And x Claw.,143,He may control that area already.
39479,Sin x And x Claw.,143,You're saying he's killed over twenty people?
39480,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It doesn't matter how many \Namateurs we throw at him.
39481,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We should warn the pros who are \Ngoing after the Needlemen.
39482,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Latun and Kenzaki aren't answering.
39483,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What?
39484,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The two airships they were \Nfollowing are in close proximity.
39485,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Most likely...
39486,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It looks like I must go.
39487,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It's a chance to show that I'm worthy \Nto be Captain of the Seirin Group!
39488,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What about the election?
39489,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Those who are able should still go.
39490,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Even if we exclude everyone who's hunting, we can still finish in the top four."
39491,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We must continue voting in the election.
39492,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Even if we can't predict the outcome, I don't \Nwant to manipulate it through absenteeism."
39493,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Why don't we hire Association Hunters?
39494,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If we show that we're trying to carry on \Nthe spirit of the Hunter Association, we could win some of the votes \Nthat are defaulting to Pariston."
39495,Sin x And x Claw.,143,He's right. We should move immediately!
39496,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If everything works out, \Nthe Association Hunters will be killed and miss the next vote."
39497,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If I told him that, I'm sure Teradein would object."
39498,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If we can't predict the outcome, we should force more absentees, \Nso it will be invalid."
39499,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Teradein is too honest, and Bushidora can't plan well."
39500,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Teradein-san has requested Hunters in \Ncompliance with the Association's terms?
39501,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Magnificent!
39502,Sin x And x Claw.,143,That's wonderful!
39503,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Accept the request! Do the job!
39504,Sin x And x Claw.,143,You don't need to be concerned about me.
39505,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"In fact, if there's no limit on the \Nnumber of Hunters we can send, spread the word and take everyone."
39506,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you come across anything you want \Nto ask or tell me while on the job, feel free to contact me anytime."
39507,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If anything needs to be improved, \Nwe can work it out."
39508,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yes, they make an excellent trio."
39509,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I like them...
39510,Sin x And x Claw.,143,They're so easy to understand.
39511,Sin x And x Claw.,143,6th Election for the 13th Chairman \N\NTotal Number of Hunters: 661
39512,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The vote's invalid because the turnout was 91.2%.
39513,Sin x And x Claw.,143,1) Pariston — 272 (41.1%) \N2) Teradein — 73 \N3) Cheadle — 66 \N4) Leorio — 58 \N5) Morel — 53 \N6) Mizaistom — 44 \N7) Botobai — 37 \N8) Ickshonpe — 0 \N\NValid Votes: 603 (58 Absentees) \NTurnout: 91.2% (Invalid)
39514,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What's going on?
39515,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Teradein!
39516,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Everyone pursuing the Needlemen was wiped out.
39517,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Our members, the camera crew, \Nand the Association Hunters!"
39518,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Even Bushidora!
39519,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Impossible!
39520,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Illumi must have hired dozens of strong soldiers!
39521,Sin x And x Claw.,143,More like one.
39522,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Since we took flight, I haven't \Nfelt anyone watching us."
39523,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Which means we really were being tailed before.
39524,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The clouds have cleared up...
39525,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Well, since we're this far from \Nthe hospital, it should be fine."
39526,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If anyone sees Alluka when we enter the hospital,"
39527,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone will say that Alluka's \Npower has been revealed, and she'll take us home immediately."
39528,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"But if I clear the area, that'll only \Nmake it easier for Illumi to act."
39529,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Taking this airship to the \Nhospital would be difficult.
39530,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Gotoh's idea to drive a car straight \Ninto the hospital may be best.
39531,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Canary?
39532,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I can't reach Gotoh.
39533,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Neither can I.
39534,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Then I need you to tell Hishita and \Nthe rest to send cars immediately to the following three locations.
39535,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I understand.
39536,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We've lost the ground pursuit \Nby flying above the clouds.
39537,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We'll be fine until we're in the car.
39538,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"After that, we have to pick the \Nbest route to the hospital."
39539,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Gon...
39540,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Hang in there.
39541,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Okay... Nice timing, Hishita."
39542,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Since we had to loop around, it took longer."
39543,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But now we're sixty kilometers \Nfrom the hospital.
39544,Sin x And x Claw.,143,They can't find us.
39545,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Take us to the hospital.
39546,Sin x And x Claw.,143,At once.
39547,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What's wrong?
39548,Sin x And x Claw.,143,There are people in front of the car.
39549,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Those... are Needlemen!
39550,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Impossible! How?
39551,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Following us should have been impossible!
39552,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Was it the car? Did they follow the car?
39553,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Hishita, hit the gas!"
39554,Sin x And x Claw.,143,They're beyond help anyway!
39555,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I can't do that, Master Killua."
39556,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Not unless Master Illumi orders it.
39557,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Wh-What?!
39558,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We're completely surrounded.
39559,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Impossible...
39560,Sin x And x Claw.,143,How can he be here?
39561,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Illumi...
39562,Sin x And x Claw.,143,How?!
39563,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It's impossible...
39564,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Unless he knew which airship we were on!
39565,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"No, that's not right..."
39566,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Even if he knew which airship, \Nhe couldn't be here."
39567,Sin x And x Claw.,143,We flew dozens of kilometers over the clouds.
39568,Sin x And x Claw.,143,He couldn't have followed us on the ground!
39569,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Kil, you seem to be hiding something \Nfrom me about Alluka."
39570,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Do I use Godspeed to get Hishita out of the car \Nand use it to escape?
39571,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Or do I go back to the airship \Nand try to escape by air?
39572,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If I were alone, those options would work."
39573,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But it'd be hard to manage \Nthat and keep Alluka safe.
39574,Sin x And x Claw.,143,How did you know we were here?
39575,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If I tell you, will you give me Alluka?"
39576,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Forget it.
39577,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I won't ask.
39578,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Alluka has an ordinary child's strength.
39579,Sin x And x Claw.,143,A single attack from one of the \NNeedlemen could be lethal.
39580,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What do I do?
39581,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I have to summon Something.
39582,Sin x And x Claw.,143,It's me.
39583,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The fool who was completely tricked.
39584,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Oh, it's Tsubone!"
39585,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Your mother can see everything that I see through this scope.
39586,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"She probably transmitted the \Nvideo to you, Master Illumi."
39587,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Bingo. Tsubone served as my spy.
39588,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"When the clouds cleared,"
39589,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I felt eyes on me again and realized the truth.
39590,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The timing was too perfect.
39591,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Ah, so you actually felt us watching..."
39592,Sin x And x Claw.,143,You're really something.
39593,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Well, now you know the truth, but you can't remove that scope because \NMom ordered you to wear it."
39594,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yes, you're completely right."
39595,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone, give me the nail from your middle finger."
39596,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yes, absolutely."
39597,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Here you are, Master."
39598,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone, give me the nail \Nfrom your ring finger."
39599,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Yes, that's easy enough."
39600,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone, I appreciate it."
39601,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Now, Master Killua..."
39602,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Make your wish.
39603,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Amane and I will take care of the rest.
39604,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Please allow me this opportunity to \Nmake amends for impeding your mission.
39605,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Are you going to do it?
39606,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Fine...
39607,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"That means when you save Gon, \Nyou'll follow the same process, right?"
39608,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you'd sacrifice those two to kill me, you won't have any problem sacrificing \Na bunch of strangers to save Gon."
39609,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Rule 5...
39610,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The same person can't make \Ntwo wishes in a row.
39611,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Would it be more fun to kill Alluka, \Nearning Killua's wrath, or more fun to spare Alluka and save \NGon, making Illumi my enemy?"
39612,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Tough call...
39613,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you say yes, I'll be happy to die."
39614,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Your inner mission will have succeeded.
39615,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"It's against the rules for family \Nmembers to kill one another, but the thing that will grant your wish... isn't family."
39616,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Assuming there's a secret rule that \Nmakes rule 5 not apply to Killua...
39617,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If my death means no other family \Nwill die, that's acceptable."
39618,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Killua will suffer for the rest of his life.
39619,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I will live in his heart forever.
39620,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Go ahead, then."
39621,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I'm offering a deal, Kil..."
39622,Sin x And x Claw.,143,My death in exchange for your word \Nthat you yourself will make the wish to save Gon.
39623,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Alluka lives while Illumi dies, but I don't earn Killua's wrath."
39624,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"So if Gon is healed, I neither gain nor lose anything."
39625,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"In that case,"
39626,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I will kill Alluka to earn Killua's wrath, then take out Killua to earn Illumi's wrath."
39627,Sin x And x Claw.,143,That is the best choice...
39628,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Something, heal Tsubone's left hand."
39629,Sin x And x Claw.,143,'Kay.
39630,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Hand. Hand.
39631,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Tsubone, put out your left hand."
39632,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Master Killua, but..."
39633,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Just do it.
39634,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Something is skilled at destroying, \Nbut fixing isn't her forte."
39635,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"When she's fixing, she must touch the target."
39636,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But...
39637,Sin x And x Claw.,143,'Kay.
39638,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Killua, pat my head!"
39639,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Of course, I will."
39640,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"That was amazing, Something."
39641,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Something is the one who calls me ""Killua."""
39642,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Healing someone is tiring, \Nso Something must sleep."
39643,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But that's it.
39644,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Something has never made a cruel \Nrequest after healing someone!
39645,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Something is kinder than anyone.
39646,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The one who's cursed is the one who wishes.
39647,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you refer to Something as an object again,"
39648,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I won't consider you my brother anymore.
39649,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Got it, Kil."
39650,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you can heal Gon without any risk, that's terrific."
39651,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"But that doesn't change the fact \Nthat Something is dangerous, and my questions remain unanswered."
39652,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Kil, you're still hiding something."
39653,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Such as how Milluki's rule 5 doesn't apply to you.
39654,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Until you tell me everything, \NI won't let Alluka go."
39655,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Stupid!
39656,Sin x And x Claw.,143,That's why I can't tell you anything.
39657,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you knew the last rule, you'd..."
39658,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"No, all of you... would put needles in my head again."
39659,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Master Killua, I will take you to the hospital."
39660,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Captain Bushidora, of the Seirin Group, was killed in pursuit of the wicked Hunter \Nthat we hoped to bring to justice."
39661,Sin x And x Claw.,143,This confirms that demons are hiding among us!
39662,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"However, I regret to say that the Seirin Group does not have the power to bring the \NHunter, or Hunters, to justice."
39663,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Everyone! This is an urgent matter that the Association must band \Ntogether to resolve at once!
39664,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"That is why our goal is to ensure \Nthat voter turnout exceeds 95%, and that the winner has a majority!"
39665,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Thus, we are currently in negotiations \Nwith Morel, who has strong ties with the former chairman's faction, in hopes \Nthat he will be our new captain."
39666,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"At the same time, we are prepared \Nto reveal the name, face, and abilities of this demon to prevent further tragedy."
39667,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you agree with our ideals, please... cast a vote for Teradein!"
39668,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Oh, uh..."
39669,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'm pretty sure I turned you down.
39670,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Can't you reconsider?
39671,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I agree that I was fairly close \Nto the former chairman, and I participated in the Ant extermination."
39672,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But I'm not a warrior.
39673,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"It was determined that my support was required, given the nature of the operation."
39674,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I wouldn't say that I'm strong.
39675,Sin x And x Claw.,143,But...
39676,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Didn't you watch them introduce the top sixteen?
39677,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'm a Sea Hunter!
39678,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I belong in the water. I'm a water man.
39679,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I don't belong on land.
39680,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Can't you adapt?
39681,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"And if you're in a hurry to end the election, you could tell your supporters to vote for Pariston!"
39682,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"Though, I'd rather die than vote for him..."
39683,Sin x And x Claw.,143,One last thing.
39684,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"If you release his identity, you and a bunch of other fools will end up dying."
39685,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"And don't use the ""Seirin Group"" \Nname when you're so weak!"
39686,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"I'm not interested in teaming up with \Npeople who won't heed my warnings, and I'm not interested in becoming chairman."
39687,Sin x And x Claw.,143,I'm done!
39688,Sin x And x Claw.,143,"7th Election for the 13th Chairman \NTotal Number of Hunters: 635 \N\N1) Pariston 293 (46.1%) \N2) Leorio 95 \N3) Cheadle 87 \N4) Mizaistom 72 \N5) Teradein 43 (Death confirmed during voting) \N6) Morel 14 \N7) Botobai, Ickshonpe 0 \N\NValid Votes: 604 (31 Absentees) \NTurnout: 95.1%"
39689,Sin x And x Claw.,143,The results of the seventh vote call \Nfor a runoff between the top four.
39690,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Four remain.
39691,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Is everything going according to Pariston's plan?
39692,Sin x And x Claw.,143,What does it take to move the human heart?
39693,Sin x And x Claw.,143,Next time: Approval x And x Coalition.
39694,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Do you need something?
39695,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I heard that you're leaving tomorrow.
39696,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're abandoning the election and your son?
39697,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That bald fool!
39698,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why did he tell her?
39699,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why don't you stay and see this through?
39700,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,We already know the election's outcome.
39701,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I've had my fun.
39702,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Meeting that Leorio guy was the best part.
39703,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He shows a lot of promise.
39704,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What are you talking about?
39705,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,We're down to four candidates. \NWe don't know the outcome.
39706,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's what I'm saying. \NSee? You do understand.
39707,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Approval x And x Coalition
39708,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I plan on voting for you today.
39709,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,See ya around.
39710,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What in the world are you talking about?
39711,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Are you stupid?
39712,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm saying the outcome will be \Nthat there is no outcome!
39713,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Want to know how many days \Nit'll be before this is over?
39714,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,How can you possibly know that?
39715,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Because you and Mizai are in this to win.
39716,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"But if you really wanted to win, \Nyou should have tried harder before."
39717,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"You needed to use any means necessary during the second or third \Nvotes to secure a majority, and clear the turnout requirement."
39718,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why are you telling me this now?
39719,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,It's easy to say whatever you want in hindsight.
39720,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If I'd warned you beforehand, \Nyou'd have done the opposite."
39721,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're so difficult!
39722,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Well, I don't care if you think \Nthis is hindsight speaking."
39723,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You can tell yourself that until the day this ends.
39724,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Wait!
39725,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What do you want?
39726,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll do as you say.
39727,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What should I do?
39728,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You don't sound too happy about it.
39729,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I don't know what Pariston is thinking.
39730,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,How do I beat him?
39731,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Except you've never done anything \NI've told you to do...
39732,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Okay, I'll start with what Pariston's thinking, then."
39733,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He doesn't want to win.
39734,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"But he doesn't want to lose, either."
39735,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's what makes him strong.
39736,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What? How can that be?
39737,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Yeah, I know."
39738,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Common sense tells you that people \Nwho want to win are stronger, right?"
39739,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Nothing wrong with that. You're right.
39740,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And being right makes you predictable.
39741,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That goes especially for when you want to win a game where you're trying to secure votes.
39742,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Game?
39743,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"See? You thought I was being disrespectful, right?"
39744,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"You're mad because you're big on morals, \Nbalance, and sticking to the manual."
39745,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Look at me.
39746,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're failing to act like a dog.
39747,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're just being yourself.
39748,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Pariston is familiar with both sides \Nof you, so he knows that."
39749,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He knows exactly what you're \Nthinking and what you'll do next.
39750,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"And even then, he doesn't want to win."
39751,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"He's damn good, right?"
39752,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Then what do I do?
39753,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I told you...
39754,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If I tell you what to do, you'll never listen."
39755,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,How many times must we go through this?
39756,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Okay, I'll tell you what happens \Nif the game continues as is."
39757,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"First, you and Pariston will be the ones \Nremaining after the next vote."
39758,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"In the two-candidate vote after \Nthat, first and second will flip."
39759,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And that's what will keep happening.
39760,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Pariston will probably try \Nto lower the turnout rate.
39761,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,The Association Hunters he has \Ncontrol over will refuse to vote.
39762,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why?
39763,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Like I said...
39764,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He doesn't want to win or lose.
39765,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He'll drag things out until the very last day.
39766,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He's just looking to have fun.
39767,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He's like Netero and me.
39768,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Well, I get bored a lot more quickly..."
39769,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,But he has more patience.
39770,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Of the four remaining candidates, \NPariston is the only one who carries on Netero's will."
39771,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You have no right to say that!
39772,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're only jealous of him.
39773,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Were you that fond of the dirty old man?
39774,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Shut your mouth!
39775,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Don't get too full of yourself!
39776,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"You just have to tell me the day \Nwhen this election will end, you stupid vagabond!"
39777,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Okay, I can do that..."
39778,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"But before this is over, you \Nshould learn to act in character."
39779,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You're impossible to talk to.
39780,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"The day Netero blew himself up, one hundred large airships belonging \Nto the Hunter Association set off for East Gorteau."
39781,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,There's no record of their departure.
39782,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,All records show that they're \Nin hangars for maintenance.
39783,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"You had no idea, did you?"
39784,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You should make friends with \Nsome mechanics and pilots.
39785,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What are you talking about?
39786,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,They're recovering approximately \Nfive thousand cocoons.
39787,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Cocoons containing chimera mutants.
39788,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Nen{\i0
39789,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And they're all probably about to hatch.
39790,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Pariston plans to have some fun with them, now that he has such a huge playground."
39791,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,The day the election ends will be \Nthe day of the next Hunter Exam.
39792,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"However, if the Commandments are reformed, the situation will change slightly."
39793,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You'll have to figure out the rest yourself.
39794,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Aren't you a Hunter?
39795,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Okay, we will now hold the eighth vote \Nfor the election of the 13th chairman."
39796,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Today, we will start by listening to speeches \Nfrom the four remaining candidates."
39797,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"After some debate among the candidates, \Nwe will move on to the vote."
39798,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,How did this happen?
39799,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Oh, I guess it's my fault..."
39800,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Now, first, we have comments from the \Ncandidates who did not qualify."
39801,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"First, I would like to thank everyone \Nwho supported me. Thank you."
39802,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"And if possible, going forward, I would ask those who had \Nfaith in me to give your votes to Cheadle."
39803,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,The Zodiacs are not united.
39804,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"However, there are those among \Nus who share very similar goals."
39805,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And the one who shares my goal is Cheadle.
39806,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Her desire to maintain balance will lead \Nthe Association in a better direction.
39807,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Where you people are now is not \Nmy reality, so do what you want."
39808,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Ging!! Don't try to run while you're \Nahead!! Get back here!!
39809,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,We will now begin the speeches \Nfrom the candidates.
39810,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,There is one thing to note.
39811,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Everyone who's gathered inside the hall today will be asked to stay until the 13th \Nchairman has been selected.
39812,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Anyone inside?
39813,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Only Tsubone and Canary.
39814,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,How's Master Alluka?
39815,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,She's still asleep.
39816,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm waiting for her to wake up.
39817,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,It won't be much longer.
39818,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Just a little longer, Gon!"
39819,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"It's possible that we will \Ncontinue to have multiple ties, but we've arranged for all necessary provisions, so you can rest easy repeating the vote as \Nmany times as necessary, be it for hours or days."
39820,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Let me repeat myself.
39821,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You may not leave this hall until the \N13th chairman has been selected.
39822,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Now, we'll start with a speech from \Nthe candidate in fourth, Mizaistom."
39823,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,This is bad.
39824,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"To eliminate Pariston, I will \Nserve as a sacrificial lamb."
39825,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll make this quick.
39826,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Of the four candidates on stage,"
39827,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I believe the one most qualified to be chairman is Cheadle.
39828,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I won't say that I'm not willing \Nto become chairman.
39829,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,But it isn't my time.
39830,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"First, I must train the Hunters under me, and work to become a Triple Hunter."
39831,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"I would appreciate it if you'd respect my \Nwishes, and help end this election today."
39832,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's all I have to say.
39833,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What should I say?
39834,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Next, we have the candidate \Nin third, Cheadle-san."
39835,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,All yours.
39836,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll also make this quick.
39837,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the 13th chairman should be Leorio."
39838,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's all I have to say.
39839,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What is Cheadle up to?
39840,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm not gonna be elected.
39841,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I don't even want to be elected.
39842,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,But I guess I should say what I want.
39843,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"My focus right now isn't this election, anyway."
39844,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Okay... Thank you.
39845,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Next, we have the candidate \Nin second, Leorio-san."
39846,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,All yours.
39847,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"You aren't smiling anymore, Pariston."
39848,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I won't let you have your way!
39849,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Huh?
39850,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Leorio-san, could you please speak?"
39851,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Leorio-san!
39852,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Damn it, Leorio!"
39853,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Are you asleep?
39854,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll strangle you!
39855,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Ah! Me?
39856,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Nope, I'm drawing a blank."
39857,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What am I doing up here?
39858,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Forget it.
39859,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,In that case...
39860,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll just say what's on my mind.
39861,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If elected chairman, I'll treat the \NAssociation like it belongs to me!"
39862,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,My first command will be to order \Nall of you to help save Gon!
39863,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,This isn't where I should be right now.
39864,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Well, it isn't like I could help \NGon if I were with him..."
39865,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He's... Gon is fighting for his life now.
39866,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He's a buddy. A friend.
39867,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,But I only found out recently.
39868,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"While I was studying for myself, drinking, moving from place to place, jerking off, entertaining women, and surfing the Internet..."
39869,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He was fighting for others.
39870,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Alongside the former chairman and their allies.
39871,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,One of them has put his life \Non the line to save Gon.
39872,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,All I could do was talk to Gon.
39873,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's all I can do.
39874,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"So if I become chairman, \NI won't stop talking to you."
39875,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Please help save Gon!
39876,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Use your heads!
39877,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If you have an idea, take action!"
39878,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If there's something I can do, tell me."
39879,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'll do anything!
39880,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Ging...
39881,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I think I understand why you \Ndidn't avoid his punch.
39882,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Even from that moment, \Nyou saw something in him."
39883,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm fine with having him as chairman.
39884,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Damn, I think I said more than I needed to."
39885,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Forget the part about jerking off.
39886,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm done.
39887,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If we're there to support him,"
39888,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm sure he'll make a good chairman.
39889,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Finally, we have the candidate \Nin first place, Pariston-san."
39890,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,All yours.
39891,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Everyone, please be quiet!"
39892,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"It's over, Pariston."
39893,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,It doesn't matter what you say.
39894,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"My eighty-seven votes, \NMizai's seventy-two votes, and the fifty-seven independent votes will be added to Leorio's ninety-five."
39895,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"That gives him three hundred, eleven votes."
39896,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He'll have over fifty percent of the vote.
39897,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,The 13th chairman will be Leorio.
39898,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Everyone, please quiet down."
39899,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Refrain from using mobile phones.
39900,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Um, in a moment, I'm going to get loud."
39901,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Everyone, you can continue \Ntalking on the phone."
39902,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,This is the true Hunter spirit.
39903,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Once this election ends, I promise to \Ndo everything I can to help Gon-kun."
39904,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"However, we must keep that matter \Nseparate from the election."
39905,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Of the remaining candidates, \Nthe one most qualified to be chairman is Mizaistom-san."
39906,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Is Valuable
39907,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,There's something I've learned after serving as Chairman Netero's \NVice Chairman for three years.
39908,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,There are three conditions a chairman needs.
39909,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,First is combat ability.
39910,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"This is an absolute necessity, \Ngiven our job requirements."
39911,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"During the recent crisis, this was evident."
39912,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Second is experience.
39913,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Wisdom comes from experience!
39914,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"As a Hunter, you can never have \Ntoo many years of experience."
39915,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why?
39916,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Why do I feel so irritated when he's talking?
39917,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And the third is caliber.
39918,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I know why...
39919,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I understand him.
39920,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He never says what he truly thinks.
39921,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,There aren't too many people who make you think that the Association would be in good \Nhands if they were chairman.
39922,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Cheadle lacks combat ability.
39923,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Leorio-san lacks experience.
39924,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Stop... Don't let emotions get the best of me.
39925,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,And I lack all three!
39926,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Hey, you were supposed to laugh."
39927,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I need to figure out what he's after.
39928,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I believe that Mizaistom-san is the only \None possessing all three qualities.
39929,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,One hundred and twenty of Pariston's two \Nhundred ninety are Association Hunters.
39930,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Thirty of the votes come from the investigative and administrative \Ndepartments he heads.
39931,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Pariston is able to control those votes as he likes without any signs or speeches.
39932,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,We will now move on to the \Ndebate among the candidates.
39933,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Pariston's speech will create a split among the independents, who were all \Nmost likely leaning toward Leorio."
39934,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,I'm guessing this is how it will look.
39935,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Leorio: Leorio votes, Cheadle votes, Morel votes, Teradein votes \N\NPariston: Association Hunter and Administrative \NDepartment votes, Pariston personal votes \N\NMizaistom: Mizai votes, Pariston votes \N\NCheadle: Mizai votes"
39936,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"But that would just push the \Nelection out another vote, which matches our goal."
39937,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Will something change during the debate?
39938,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Fine, then... I'll figure this out myself!"
39939,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Can I go first, then?"
39940,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"No, I go first."
39941,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"As I said earlier, I'm not interested \Nin becoming chairman."
39942,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"No, you said that you wouldn't say \Nyou're not willing to become chairman."
39943,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"However, this isn't about what you want, Mizai-san."
39944,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,What matters is how the voters feel.
39945,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Sometimes, there are situations where a job \Ncan only be done by a certain person."
39946,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That's where caliber comes in.
39947,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You shouldn't be talking about how you feel.
39948,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Stop the petty tricks, and let the voters decide."
39949,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,You have the nerve to say that?
39950,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,But why is he pushing Mizai?
39951,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Does he expect us to let greed get the better of \Nus and push Mizai to second?
39952,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,That will never happen!
39953,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Because the votes for Leorio \Nare primarily independent.
39954,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"If Leorio loses, they're likely to swing to Pariston."
39955,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"But if Leorio remains, the votes previously cast for myself \Nand the openly anti-Pariston Mizai will go to Leorio."
39956,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"He'll hold on to Teradein's anti-Zodiac votes, and the Morel votes are also anti-Pariston."
39957,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Meaning that they'll never switch to Pariston.
39958,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Got it, Mizai?"
39959,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"Yeah, I understand."
39960,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Defeating Pariston is the ultimate goal.
39961,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"As a Crime Hunter, I trust my instinct."
39962,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"There's no proof, and it's entirely possible \Nthat his hands are clean."
39963,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,However...
39964,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,He definitely has underground ties.
39965,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,We can't let him run rampant within \Nthe Association any longer.
39966,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Since it appears that not even \NNetero could rein him in...
39967,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,This election is where we must...
39968,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,...tear down Pariston's system.
39969,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"And so, the eighth vote for \Nthe 13th chairman begins."
39970,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,The votes fly.
39971,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Is he defeated?
39972,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,"As Killua takes Something's hand, \Neverything approaches its end."
39973,Approval x And x Coalition.,144,Next time: Defeat x And x Reunion.
39974,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Please help save Gon!
39975,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Use your heads!
39976,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If you have an idea, take action!"
39977,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If there's something I can do, tell me."
39978,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I'll do anything!
39979,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Defeat x And x Reunion
39980,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The results of the eighth chairman election were promptly counted by Beans.
39981,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Now, please take a look at the result of \Nthe eighth election for the 13th chairman!"
39982,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Wow!
39983,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Eighth Election for the 13th Chairman \N\N1) Leorio 282 (44.4%) \N2) Pariston 250 \N3) Mizaistom 58 \N4) Cheadle 16 \N\NTurnout: 95.4%
39984,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This puts Leorio in first place!
39985,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"For the first time, Pariston hasn't \Nfinished in first place..."
39986,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"However, the first place vote-getter, Leorio, \Nreceived only 44.4% of the vote."
39987,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"That was below the 50% requirement, which means we'll finally have a run-off \Nbetween the top two vote-getters."
39988,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Are they serious about this?
39989,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Then I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want.
39990,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Oh, it's Brother."
39991,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Morning.
39992,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Did you sleep well?
39993,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Uh-huh.
39994,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Where are we?
39995,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The hospital.
39996,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"My friend is here, sleeping. He's very sick."
39997,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I want to help get him on his feet again.
39998,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You want Something to take over.
39999,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Boo! Just when I was able to spend time with you!
40000,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Don't worry.
40001,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Like I told you...
40002,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,We'll be together from now on.
40003,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,And that's a promise.
40004,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Please help me.
40005,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I knew it.
40006,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Killua is the one person who doesn't \Nhave to follow the rules.
40007,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Though I'll have to check whether it's specific to Killua or something \Nthat happens after a wish is used to heal.
40008,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Okay, I'll do it."
40009,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Either way, the power to destroy and fix can become a powerful tool \Nif the user can be tamed."
40010,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,His utter lack of humanity and wicked ambition deviate even from the path of an assassin.
40011,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,How tragic...
40012,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"When he was being controlled, he suffered less."
40013,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Alluka is only awake when Something is asleep.
40014,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,She spends less time as Alluka than one would think.
40015,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"The time after Something's requests \Naren't met and people die, until Something makes the next level-1 request..."
40016,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Or the time when request-making is paused \Nafter someone leaves Something before her three requests are complete...
40017,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Or the time after Something fixes and falls asleep, until someone else makes a wish \Nto Alluka and has it granted..."
40018,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Making this the last wish and never \Nwishing to Something again would be the best thing that could happen.
40019,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Hand... Hand...
40020,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Please,"
40021,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Something...
40022,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Please heal Gon!
40023,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,'Kay.
40024,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Such incredible power...
40025,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What's happening inside?
40026,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Who's doing this?
40027,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What is this?
40028,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I've never felt anything like this before.
40029,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Are you serious? Are you serious?
40030,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Then I'm going to do whatever I want.
40031,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Magnificent.
40032,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I want this.
40033,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This... belongs to me.
40034,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Then let me ask the two remaining candidates if they have anything they want to say.
40035,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If not, we will proceed with the final vote."
40036,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,It's futile.
40037,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,It doesn't matter what you have to say.
40038,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Well, I have a feeling that \Nthis election is already over, but I would like to ask Leorio-san a question."
40039,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Can you answer this question for me again?
40040,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What will you do if you become chairman?
40041,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Leorio-san, can you please \Ngive us your answer again?"
40042,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What will you do if you become chairman?
40043,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Save Gon!
40044,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,And I'll make all of you help me!
40045,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,That's all.
40046,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"This would have been the perfect time, but I'm not God."
40047,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"In that case, do you have any \Nplans for shuffling personnel or restructuring the organization?"
40048,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Of course not!
40049,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I don't even know why I'm \Nstanding here right now!
40050,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Naturally...
40051,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Those are all the questions I have.
40052,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"It's futile, Pariston."
40053,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Everyone was aware of those answers \Nwhen they voted for Leorio.
40054,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,His supporters applauded because they \Nhave every intention of backing him!
40055,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Do you have any questions for me?
40056,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,No! Let's just get this over with!
40057,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I understand.
40058,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Then I move for an emergency council.
40059,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Huh?
40060,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Er, what are you saying?"
40061,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,An emergency council.
40062,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"In accordance with the Eighth \Nand Ninth Hunter Commandments,"
40063,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I move for a vote of confidence.
40064,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The topic will be a revision of the Hunter \NCommandments and the Hunter Exam.
40065,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"First, I propose that we abolish the \Ncurrent Hunter Exam system."
40066,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If you agree, please vote ""yea."""
40067,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If you disagree, please vote ""nay."""
40068,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Hold it right there!
40069,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"During the Zodiac council, we decided the Ten Commandments weren't to be touched!"
40070,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,That isn't relevant right now!
40071,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,No.
40072,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"You're wrong, stupid tiger!"
40073,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You're absolutely right.
40074,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The council reached an 11-1 majority decision.
40075,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I was the only one in favor of \Nrevising the Ten Commandments.
40076,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If Cheadle-san or Mizaistom-san were \Nstanding on the stage now,"
40077,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I would have deferred to the council and \Nkept my mouth shut until the election ended.
40078,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,But both of them are out of the running.
40079,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,And Leorio-san has stated that he \Nhas no plan for the Association!
40080,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This is the only time
40081,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"I can express my opinion as vice chairman, \Nand not as a member of the Zodiacs."
40082,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Don't you understand, Kanzai-san?"
40083,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This is the only chance I will ever get!
40084,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Of course, I could use the Eighth Commandment to override the council's decision \Nand force the matter to a vote."
40085,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,But I wanted to avoid that.
40086,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The Zodiacs are something precious \Nthat the former chairman left us.
40087,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Hey, if you say something stupid, \Nhe'll pay you back ten times over."
40088,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Honestly, part of me wishes to let this \Nmatter die without making waves."
40089,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"However, the late Teradein-san and \NBushidora-san made an excellent point."
40090,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,The Third and Fourth Commandments are suffering gravely as a result \Nof the current exam process!
40091,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,He doesn't want to win.
40092,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"He doesn't want to lose, either."
40093,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You're right...
40094,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,He's a spiteful person!
40095,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"He doesn't care about winning or losing, so with nothing to gain or lose, he can \Nalways stay dispassionate and calm, while he manipulates others and plays the rules against us in the worst way possible."
40096,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,May I say something?
40097,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Yes, what is it?"
40098,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"If Leorio wins, I volunteer to serve as an advisor."
40099,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I promise to conduct a comprehensive review of the Ten Commandments and \NHunter Exam at that point.
40100,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I won't let you grab any of the Teradein votes!
40101,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I'll counter every point you've made!
40102,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"To everyone who's voting for \Nthe potential Leorio shows, but who's concerned about \Nhow he will serve initially,"
40103,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"I will quell those concerns, even if it \Nrequires me to leave the Zodiacs."
40104,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Hey, hey, hey!"
40105,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I have no idea what you people are talking about.
40106,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,But I'm in a hurry to save Gon \Nas quickly as possible!
40107,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Leorio!
40108,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Gon!
40109,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Damn!
40110,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You had me so worried!
40111,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Leorio!
40112,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I'm so glad!
40113,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,So glad!
40114,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Did I l look that bad?
40115,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Bad doesn't even begin to describe it!
40116,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Leorio, stop."
40117,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,He's healed now. Isn't that enough?
40118,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Yeah, you're right."
40119,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Everyone was worried about you.
40120,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Thank you... Thank you.
40121,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,He got us.
40122,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Pariston wanted Leorio to be his final opponent!
40123,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Leorio no longer has the motive or \Nsupport to become chairman.
40124,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You become chairman!
40125,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Who's the bald guy?
40126,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Leorio, you can't tell Gon that Killua healed him."
40127,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Huh? Why not?
40128,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You can't tell him!
40129,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"For Killua's sake, promise not to tell him."
40130,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"O-Okay, got it."
40131,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Pariston, when?"
40132,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,When did you predict that this would happen?
40133,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Huh?
40134,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"No, no..."
40135,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I don't have the ability to predict anything.
40136,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This was pure coincidence.
40137,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Please tell me. I want to know.
40138,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"It hurts to admit this, but I've been defeated."
40139,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,It was when Ging-san said he \Nwould run for chairman...
40140,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What?
40141,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"After he said he would run,"
40142,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I asked a question to provoke him.
40143,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"And he responded that Gon-kun wouldn't die, right?"
40144,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Go visit him.
40145,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,He isn't going to die.
40146,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"In that moment,"
40147,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I could see the scene that \Njust transpired before us.
40148,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Well, I anticipated Ging-san \Nand I would stand on stage, and Ging-san would ultimately win."
40149,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"At least, in my vision."
40150,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"First, since Ging-san said Gon-kun wouldn't die,"
40151,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I knew that meant there was a way to heal him.
40152,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"And that if he became part of the \Nelection, I would never win."
40153,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Do you understand?
40154,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,That was the moment I was defeated.
40155,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"But Ging-san gave up on the election, then Leorio-san arrived, and hit him."
40156,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"When he stood on stage and talked about his friends risking \Ntheir lives to save Gon-kun,"
40157,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I finally saw the complete picture.
40158,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"I was assured of my victory a moment ago, when I felt that immense power."
40159,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I could sense that Gon-kun's friends had saved him.
40160,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,All that remained was to delay \Nthe vote until he arrived.
40161,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Oh, I'll retract the earlier motion, \Nso there's nothing for you to worry about."
40162,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,That was all the information you had?
40163,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,You{\i0
40164,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I trust Ging-san as an enemy.
40165,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,And these are the friends that \NGing-san trusted to save his son.
40166,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I trust them.
40167,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Why wouldn't I?
40168,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Run for chairman!
40169,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,I'll vote for you!
40170,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Get on stage and say something!
40171,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Speech! Speech!
40172,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"Man, I don't know what to do."
40173,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Ging?
40174,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,This is bad.
40175,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,"But, well, this was always gonna happen..."
40176,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Gon has finally caught sight of Ging's back.
40177,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,What will he say to him?
40178,Defeat x And x Reunion.,145,Next time: Chairman x And x Release.
40179,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging?
40180,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Chairman x And x Release
40181,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Yo.
40182,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging!
40183,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm sorry!
40184,Chairman x And x Release.,146,It was my fault...
40185,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Because of me, Kite turned into a little girl!"
40186,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I h-heard he was captured by the enemy.
40187,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yeah, I was with Kite..."
40188,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Then Kite told me to run away, and Pitou showed up."
40189,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Kite lost his arm, I was knocked out, and then we trained..."
40190,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Shoot got Kite out of the Ants' nest, but it wasn't Kite..."
40191,Chairman x And x Release.,146,They did all kinds of horrible things!
40192,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When I met Pitou again,"
40193,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Pitou said that Kite was already dead!
40194,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Okay, I get it!"
40195,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Well, I don't get it, but just have a seat, okay?"
40196,Chairman x And x Release.,146,U-Uh... Er...
40197,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Let's calm down.
40198,Chairman x And x Release.,146,We should both try to calm down...
40199,Chairman x And x Release.,146,It was because I insisted... on having my way!
40200,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Oh, um..."
40201,Chairman x And x Release.,146,A-A-Anyway...
40202,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Just calm down first.
40203,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging is...
40204,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging is actually flustered.
40205,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I should have been the one who died!
40206,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Gon.
40207,Chairman x And x Release.,146,That isn't true.
40208,Chairman x And x Release.,146,He took you along because he believed in you.
40209,Chairman x And x Release.,146,He told you to run because he'd \Nunderestimated the enemy.
40210,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If he hadn't thought you capable, he wouldn't have let you accompany \Nhim, no matter what you'd said."
40211,Chairman x And x Release.,146,It was his fault that he misjudged the enemy.
40212,Chairman x And x Release.,146,But—
40213,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I know.
40214,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You're also at fault for being too weak!
40215,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You should feel responsible.
40216,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Don't make the same mistake.
40217,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!"
40218,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive, but either way, you should apologize!"
40219,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Yeah.
40220,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule."
40221,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Do you know it?
40222,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh?
40223,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"No, what is it?"
40224,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You promise to do things differently next time.
40225,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"And you keep that promise, no matter what."
40226,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Uh-huh.
40227,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Okay, get going!"
40228,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Yeah!
40229,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging?
40230,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Can I... talk to you some more later?
40231,Chairman x And x Release.,146,That might be difficult.
40232,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm a busy man...
40233,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"That's crap, Ging!"
40234,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Aren't you his father?
40235,Chairman x And x Release.,146,How cold can you be?!
40236,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I know about Greed Island!
40237,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You never went to see Gon after he cleared it!
40238,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Too bashful or something?
40239,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"All you you, shut up!"
40240,Chairman x And x Release.,146,It's none of your business!
40241,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"You're a jerk, Ging!"
40242,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You should apologize to Gon!
40243,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Promise him you'll act more like a father!
40244,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Hell, you don't have the right \Nto say you're his father!"
40245,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Make up your minds!
40246,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You can all screw yourselves!
40247,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You should have Leorio punch you again!
40248,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yeah, just shut up!"
40249,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Fine, then..."
40250,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I'll be waiting, so get going!"
40251,Chairman x And x Release.,146,How stupid do you think we are?
40252,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You take him there!
40253,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Aren't you his father?
40254,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Okay, fine!"
40255,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll take you all on!
40256,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you have a problem with \Nwhat I'm doing, bring it on!"
40257,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You're all against me? Okay!
40258,Chairman x And x Release.,146,That's fine by me!
40259,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Everyone!
40260,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Quiet down!
40261,Chairman x And x Release.,146,The election isn't over yet.
40262,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yes, I still haven't given up."
40263,Chairman x And x Release.,146,A new last chance has appeared!
40264,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Gon-kun—
40265,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Go ahead, then."
40266,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Due to the circumstances, no one \Ncan leave until the election is over."
40267,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"You're in a hurry, aren't you?"
40268,Chairman x And x Release.,146,But this will be the final vote.
40269,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Once you vote, you'll be allowed to leave."
40270,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you tell us your choice right now, everyone here will accept that as a valid vote."
40271,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Between myself, Pariston, and Leorio-san, whom do you believe is most \Nfit to become chairman?"
40272,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I should mention that the \Nformer chairman, Netero, is taking an extended vacation \Nafter defeating the Ant King."
40273,Chairman x And x Release.,146,How can you say such a thing?
40274,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If Gon picks Leorio after his dramatic arrival, everyone may get caught up in \Nthe heat of the moment again and vote for Leorio."
40275,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Chairman?
40276,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Leorio's running for chairman?
40277,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"No! See, some stuff happened..."
40278,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Gon-kun, you can rely on your gut."
40279,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Be true to your heart, and pick one of us."
40280,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Uh... Then,"
40281,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll pick Pariston-san!
40282,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh?
40283,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Isn't Leorio-san your friend?
40284,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Shouldn't you pick him?
40285,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Nope, because Leorio wants \Nto become a doctor, so he can't be chairman!"
40286,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Of course!
40287,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Now I've been completely defeated.
40288,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Thank you, Gon-kun."
40289,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Then let's begin the vote.
40290,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Oh, sorry."
40291,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm going with Gon.
40292,Chairman x And x Release.,146,My vote goes to Pariston.
40293,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Leorio...
40294,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I know.
40295,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging!
40296,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm going now!
40297,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Yeah.
40298,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Is that all you have to say, you idiot?"
40299,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"At least say, ""See you later""!"
40300,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Where's your common sense?
40301,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging's snapped!
40302,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Someone stop this negligent jerk of a father!
40303,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Heart {\c&H444745&
40304,Chairman x And x Release.,146,That's impossible!
40305,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Zodiacs, don't just stand there \Nand smile! Do something!"
40306,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I guess, in his own way, Ging's popular."
40307,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yeah, I guess so..."
40308,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Hey, Gon!"
40309,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I remembered something.
40310,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Nen{\i0
40311,Chairman x And x Release.,146,And I taught him his techniques.
40312,Chairman x And x Release.,146,There's a number that his \NCrazy Slots won't bring up unless he's adamant about not dying!
40313,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If he's still alive, that's probably why."
40314,Chairman x And x Release.,146,He would never consider dying in your place.
40315,Chairman x And x Release.,146,So don't mess up your apology.
40316,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Or he'll smack you again!
40317,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Got it!
40318,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I'm off, then!"
40319,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Yeah! I'll be waiting!
40320,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Again?
40321,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ging...
40322,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Ninth Election for the 13th Chairman \N\NTotal Number of Hunters: 635 \N\N1) Pariston 458 (72.1%) \N2) Leorio 157 \N\NTurnout: 96.8%  Valid Votes: 615
40323,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Hello, everyone."
40324,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I am your 13th chairman, Pariston."
40325,Chairman x And x Release.,146,And I have an important announcement.
40326,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I, Pariston, name Cheadle-san as vice chairman, and resign as chairman."
40327,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Okay, then."
40328,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I didn't see that coming.
40329,Chairman x And x Release.,146,How long must you make fools of us?!
40330,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Come back here!
40331,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I didn't become vice chairman because \NI wanted to become chairman.
40332,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I just wanted to hinder the chairman.
40333,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When I said silly things to tease him,"
40334,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Netero-san always looked so happy...
40335,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I really wanted to play with him some more.
40336,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I recommend that you reform the Hunter \NExam and Commandments quickly.
40337,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Cheadle-san, if the Association becomes \Na dull place under your leadership,"
40338,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll get serious about toying with you.
40339,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Leorio, where's Killua?"
40340,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh?
40341,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Oh, I don't know."
40342,Chairman x And x Release.,146,He isn't answering his phone.
40343,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"It sounds like he was traveling, \Nlooking for a way to save you."
40344,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Well, once we contact him, \NI'm sure he'll come see you."
40345,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I need to apologize to Killua.
40346,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When I was fighting the enemy, I got confused, and I said terrible things to him."
40347,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I'm sorry, too."
40348,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh?
40349,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Why are you apologizing?
40350,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Well, sorry that I couldn't do anything \Nwhen you guys were in trouble."
40351,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh? What do you mean?
40352,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I don't get it.
40353,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yeah, I'm really sorry."
40354,Chairman x And x Release.,146,The requests following a wish for a computer should be more severe than playing \Ndead and a pat on the head.
40355,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When I heard Milluki's report, \Nthat was the first thing that seemed off."
40356,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"And when the two-choice wish resulted \Nin a simple kiss on the cheek, it demanded fingernails, a far too heavy price."
40357,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Assuming that the fingernails were \Nthe price for the computer,"
40358,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Wish                                            Request that would match the balance between \Nwishes and requests seen previously.
40359,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If my theory is correct, playing dead and the pat on the head \Nweren't requests from Something."
40360,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Thus, the two-choice wish didn't require a payment."
40361,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Why was that the case?
40362,Chairman x And x Release.,146,There are two possibilities.
40363,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"One, because the wish was simple enough that Something's power wasn't required."
40364,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Two, because it wasn't a wish."
40365,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"However, there's still an unresolved question here."
40366,Chairman x And x Release.,146,If playing dead and the pat on the head \Nweren't requests from Something...
40367,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"They were requests from Alluka, not Something."
40368,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Killua claims that Something calls him ""Killua,"" and the request to play dead was made to ""Brother."""
40369,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Thus, the one who calls Killua ""Brother"" is Alluka."
40370,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If the request came from Alluka, then Something wasn't awake, and Killua shouldn't have been \Nable to make the two-choice wish."
40371,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"However, Something responded to Killua's wish."
40372,Chairman x And x Release.,146,The hint to resolving this contradiction \Nlies in the wording Killua used.
40373,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When making the two-choice wish, \NKillua was not asking."
40374,Chairman x And x Release.,146,He was commanding.
40375,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"It makes sense that a command \Nwould work differently than a wish, and would not require a payment upon completion."
40376,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Those are my conclusions.
40377,Chairman x And x Release.,146,What do you think?
40378,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll get to the point.
40379,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I'm the one who can use Something's power, \Neffectively and safely, for the Zoldyck family."
40380,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"As it stands, Alluka is no more than \Na spirit locked forever in one room."
40381,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"But if I control him with you at his side, at the very least, I can guarantee his freedom."
40382,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Brother...
40383,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll protect Alluka.
40384,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Kil, you need to learn your place."
40385,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Something, wake up."
40386,Chairman x And x Release.,146,'Kay.
40387,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Kil, this is your last chance."
40388,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Let me have Something—
40389,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Something!
40390,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Send Illumi back home!
40391,Chairman x And x Release.,146,'Kay.
40392,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Teleportation...
40393,Chairman x And x Release.,146,For real?
40394,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Oh, you were all watching?"
40395,Chairman x And x Release.,146,That's amazing... He's invincible.
40396,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If Killua issues a command, there is no need to worry about requests."
40397,Chairman x And x Release.,146,This means that turning Killua into \Nmy puppet is worth any price.
40398,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Tsubone, Amane..."
40399,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Can you leave us alone for a moment?
40400,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you don't leave on your own,"
40401,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll have to issue Something a command.
40402,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Killua, pat my head..."
40403,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Something is doing this because \Nshe wants me to praise her.
40404,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I don't want to use her by issuing commands.
40405,Chairman x And x Release.,146,So please...
40406,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Killua...
40407,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Killua!
40408,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Killua!
40409,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Killua...
40410,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Something...
40411,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Killua, pat my head."
40412,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You can't come out anymore.
40413,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I love Killua.
40414,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"You can't come out, Something."
40415,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I love Killua.
40416,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I love Killua!
40417,Chairman x And x Release.,146,You can't!
40418,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Never come out again!
40419,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Got it?
40420,Chairman x And x Release.,146,'Kay...
40421,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Alluka is free now.
40422,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm sorry.
40423,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I'm sorry, Something."
40424,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm sorry...
40425,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Alluka?
40426,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Brother?
40427,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yep, it's your big—"
40428,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Did you make Something cry?
40429,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Huh?
40430,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Er, well..."
40431,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"She's still hunched over, crying!"
40432,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Apologize to her!
40433,Chairman x And x Release.,146,But...
40434,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Apologize!
40435,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you're nice to me, you have to \Nbe nice to Something, too!"
40436,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you're going to protect me, \Nyou have to protect Something, too!"
40437,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"If you're mean to Something, I'll hate you!"
40438,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Alluka, thank you."
40439,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I guess I was still under Ill-nii's control.
40440,Chairman x And x Release.,146,But everything's okay now.
40441,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Can you tell Something to come out?
40442,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Something, I'm sorry."
40443,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I was wrong.
40444,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm sorry!
40445,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"I was scared of Ill-nii, and I couldn't defy him."
40446,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"So I did what he said, and I hated it."
40447,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"When I realized he might force you to do bad things, too, I got really scared..."
40448,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"For Alluka's sake, I lied to myself, and I said mean things to you."
40449,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'm really sorry!
40450,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Something,"
40451,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll protect you.
40452,Chairman x And x Release.,146,We'll always be together!
40453,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Don't listen to wishes from anyone else anymore!
40454,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I'll pat you on the head whenever you want!
40455,Chairman x And x Release.,146,So would you please come out again?
40456,Chairman x And x Release.,146,'Kay...
40457,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Something, will you forgive me for being a bad big brother?"
40458,Chairman x And x Release.,146,'Kay.
40459,Chairman x And x Release.,146,I... love Killua.
40460,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Tsubone, I've rescinded the restriction on Killua."
40461,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Please let him know.
40462,Chairman x And x Release.,146,"Yes, I understand."
40463,Chairman x And x Release.,146,His first friend.
40464,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Too many memories to speak of.
40465,Chairman x And x Release.,146,A new journey.
40466,Chairman x And x Release.,146,Next time: Salvation x And x Future.
40467,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Something, will you forgive me for being a bad big brother?"
40468,Salvation x And x Future.,147,'Kay.
40469,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I... love Killua.
40470,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Don't make the same mistake.
40471,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"And you should apologize to Kite, not to me!"
40472,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"You didn't clearly say if he's dead or alive, but either way, you should apologize!"
40473,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"When apologizing to a friend, there's a rule."
40474,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Do you know it?
40475,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Huh?
40476,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"No, what is it?"
40477,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You promise to do things differently next time.
40478,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"And you keep that promise, no matter what."
40479,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Uh-huh.
40480,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Salvation x And x Future
40481,Salvation x And x Future.,147,She had red hair just like yours.
40482,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I shot her because
40483,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I knew that the scumbags pursuing her enjoyed keeping their prey alive to toy with.
40484,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"After my rebirth as an Ant,"
40485,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I realized that I was doing the \Nsame things I'd done before.
40486,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Before I was reborn this way, \Nmy job was to get rid of people."
40487,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"When ordered to, I pulled the trigger."
40488,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I spent the rest of my time yelling at people.
40489,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It was a job anyone could do.
40490,Salvation x And x Future.,147,A ridiculous cycle that continues even after rebirth.
40491,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I wanted to give her an escape from that cycle.
40492,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I didn't know exactly how it all worked, but..."
40493,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I felt that if I let them capture her, \Ntorture her, then kill her, the cycle would repeat itself."
40494,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"A dull life in the middle of nowhere, but one lived in peace and quiet..."
40495,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Until that life was suddenly ended \Nby mindless violence.
40496,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I pulled the trigger with a prayer that she would escape that cycle.
40497,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Regardless of my actions, \Nthe Queen ate hundreds of humans."
40498,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"And when they were reborn, only a few \Ncould remember their prior lives."
40499,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It's possible that most of the human \Nsouls managed to safely escape.
40500,Salvation x And x Future.,147,But I wanted to do something.
40501,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I wanted to feel like I was helping them escape.
40502,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"If you're inside that body instead of her, that probably means she escaped, and I still haven't run into an Ant who's told me I killed them in their prior life."
40503,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Perhaps they were all able to escape.
40504,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Before all this happened, I didn't believe \Nin the human soul's existence."
40505,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I believed that humans had the same worth as flies or fleas, \Nand that they only lived and then died."
40506,Salvation x And x Future.,147,That the ego was nothing more than a bug that arose because the human \Nbrain was slightly more complex.
40507,Salvation x And x Future.,147,That there was nothing after death.
40508,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Our bodies simply decomposed, \Nturned to dust, and scattered."
40509,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I believed those tiny fragments had no purpose.
40510,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"But now, here I am."
40511,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And I'm repeating the cycle.
40512,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"My appearance is completely different, but I'm doing the same stupid things as before."
40513,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It made me think.
40514,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I may be a fool, but I won't deny \Nthe things that I know now."
40515,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And I don't want to ignore the \Nthings I don't understand.
40516,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I died.
40517,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I died, and my body was broken into tiny pieces."
40518,Salvation x And x Future.,147,But that wasn't the end.
40519,Salvation x And x Future.,147,The fragments that I believed were \Ntoo small to retain any meaning possessed a power I could have never imagined.
40520,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Particles no larger than pollen from our perspective have enough energy to impact our health tens or hundreds of millions of years later.
40521,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"And our DNA, which is even smaller, contains the vast amount of information that \Ncomprises us, all within a double helix."
40522,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And that infinitesimally small \Nsize is a necessity for the birth of the enormous space \Nknown as the universe.
40523,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Just because something is small does \Nnot mean it produces less energy.
40524,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"The soul is probably small, but it has \Nenough energy to repeat the cycle."
40525,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Does that mean I was reborn to continue that cycle?
40526,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I don't know what the future holds.
40527,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"So this is nothing more than \Nspeculation on my part, but something inside told me that I \Nmustn't repeat the same things again."
40528,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm guessing that I'm forced \Nto repeat all of this because there was something I failed to provide \Nmy soul with while I was alive.
40529,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You know how the body moves more slowly without \Nthe soul's encouragement...
40530,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"In my case, I've always been driven by the thought that I can't let things stay this way."
40531,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I know it isn't right.
40532,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I will repeat the cycle, while thinking that I have to change things."
40533,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Because I made the wrong choice.
40534,Salvation x And x Future.,147,My target shouldn't have been that girl.
40535,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It should have been the ones pursuing her.
40536,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It's no big deal.
40537,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It just means I was the biggest scumbag of all.
40538,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"The price for cleansing a tainted \Nsoul was too heavy, so I avoided that."
40539,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"While selfishly praying that her soul would escape,"
40540,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I was desperate to avoid getting hurt myself.
40541,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I shot her to protect myself.
40542,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"And now, I'm trying to save myself again \Nby confessing my sins to you, the one who inherited her appearance."
40543,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Really...
40544,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm a hopeless case.
40545,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I appreciate your listening to my story.
40546,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Wait. Don't run away.
40547,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You come with me.
40548,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Forever.
40549,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"You'll stay with the person you shot, living life the only way you can."
40550,Salvation x And x Future.,147,This is your duty.
40551,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You have no choice.
40552,Salvation x And x Future.,147,No one will allow you to take your own life and hit the reset button.
40553,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You must live and apologize to me every day.
40554,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I'll keep you so busy, you'll never have time to worry about what's right or wrong."
40555,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"You will apologize to me and do the work I tell you to do, as you devote your life to me."
40556,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"If you forget your current resolve and slip,"
40557,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I will kill you.
40558,Salvation x And x Future.,147,So you can focus on living.
40559,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Kite, you have a visitor."
40560,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Let them in.
40561,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Kite?
40562,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40563,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Sorry.
40564,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Come. Sit.
40565,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Sorry for what?
40566,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I wasn't able to fight by your side.
40567,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I wasn't strong enough.
40568,Salvation x And x Future.,147,But...
40569,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Next time, I'll protect you!"
40570,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It sounds like you did some \Ncrazy stuff to defeat Pitou.
40571,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Yeah, I almost died..."
40572,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"However, that doesn't change the fact \Nthat you defeated an enemy I couldn't."
40573,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I suppose I can soothe my ego by telling myself that my judgment was correct.
40574,Salvation x And x Future.,147,But I wouldn't be here now without \Nhelp from Killua and everyone else.
40575,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I didn't make it here by myself.
40576,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It appears that we both needed more training.
40577,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I heard that you met Ging-san.
40578,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Did you talk to Ging?
40579,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40580,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You should go back to him.
40581,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I understand what you wanted to say.
40582,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm glad you came to see me.
40583,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"If I need help, I promise to let you know."
40584,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Say hi to Killua for me.
40585,Salvation x And x Future.,147,We're friends now.
40586,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"So right now, go back to Ging-san."
40587,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Okay.
40588,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Sorry.
40589,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Sorry for what?
40590,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I was trying to take the easy way out \Nby running away from everything.
40591,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"No matter the pain, I will keep living."
40592,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"So when I die, I'll feel I did the best I could."
40593,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Ging!
40594,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm waiting atop the World Tree.
40595,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I tried to stop him... here{\i0
40596,Salvation x And x Future.,147,It's huge!
40597,Salvation x And x Future.,147,This is definitely the tallest tree in the world.
40598,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"The World Tree stands at the city's center, at a height of 1,784 meters."
40599,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Humans are still unable to build a taller structure.
40600,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Climbing the tree is not forbidden, but you must pay a fee and sign a written agreement."
40601,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"You can reach the 500-meter \Npoint by elevator or stairs, but after that, you'll be risking your life."
40602,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Every year, around 3,000 \Npeople attempt the climb, but 94% fail to reach the 1,000-meter \Npoint, and turn back."
40603,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Another 4% are forced to pay an extremely \Npricey fee to be rescued from the tree, and another 1% fall and die."
40604,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Which means that, each year, \Nonly about 30 people make it to the top and return safely."
40605,Salvation x And x Future.,147,So...
40606,Salvation x And x Future.,147,This is as far as we're going.
40607,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40608,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Be careful.
40609,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40610,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Killua, thank you for everything."
40611,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40612,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Well, after you told me you would defeat Pitou alone and that it was none of my business,"
40613,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I was pretty depressed!
40614,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm really sorry...
40615,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Brother!
40616,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Well, you apologized."
40617,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And I think I can say I'm only here with Alluka \Nnow because of the time I spent with you.
40618,Salvation x And x Future.,147,She's the one who healed you.
40619,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Huh?! Is that true?
40620,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Why are you telling me now?
40621,Salvation x And x Future.,147,You should have told me sooner!
40622,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Sorry.
40623,Salvation x And x Future.,147,We don't want too many people knowing about this.
40624,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"You know, it's sort of a complicated family thing..."
40625,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Come with me!
40626,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Alluka, can you tell Something to come out?"
40627,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40628,Salvation x And x Future.,147,She has the power to grant any wish I make.
40629,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Any wish?
40630,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Because of that power, \Nshe was locked up in our house."
40631,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"But thanks to you, she's outside now."
40632,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And I'm prepared to spend the \Nrest of my life protecting her.
40633,Salvation x And x Future.,147,We should be the ones thanking you.
40634,Salvation x And x Future.,147,'Kay.
40635,Salvation x And x Future.,147,N-No way...
40636,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I should be thanking you!
40637,Salvation x And x Future.,147,This is no good. If we stay here any longer...
40638,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah.
40639,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'll be traveling to all kinds of places with Alluka.
40640,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'll e-mail you from time to time.
40641,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Me, too."
40642,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"If anything comes up, let me know."
40643,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'll do the same.
40644,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Yeah, I will."
40645,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Since you owe me a lot...
40646,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Say hi to your dad for me.
40647,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yep.
40648,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"I want to go with you, but I have to watch Alluka."
40649,Salvation x And x Future.,147,And you haven't had a chance to talk alone yet.
40650,Salvation x And x Future.,147,See you around.
40651,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"After I've had my brother all to \Nmyself for a while, I'll set him free."
40652,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Will you hang out with him then?
40653,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Hold on!
40654,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'm the one choosing to hang out with him!
40655,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Isn't she a great sister?
40656,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, \Nyou're in second place."
40657,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Kite said that no matter where we go, we'll always be friends!"
40658,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah!
40659,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Bye!
40660,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Later!
40661,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Next time: Past x And x Future.
40662,Salvation x And x Future.,147,I'll introduce you to Ging eventually!
40663,Salvation x And x Future.,147,"Yeah, that's a promise."
40664,Salvation x And x Future.,147,So until we meet again!
40665,Salvation x And x Future.,147,Yeah!
40666,Past x And x Future.,148,He abandoned you when you were still just a baby.
40667,Past x And x Future.,148,But you still want to...
40668,Past x And x Future.,148,He was willing to abandon his own kid for it.
40669,Past x And x Future.,148,That's how amazing it is to be a Hunter!
40670,Past x And x Future.,148,You really are his son...
40671,Past x And x Future.,148,The last test to be accepted \Nby Ging-san is to find him.
40672,Past x And x Future.,148,It's a task more difficult than any Hunt.
40673,Past x And x Future.,148,"As far as I know, he's the greatest Hunter there is."
40674,Past x And x Future.,148,There's something that I want.
40675,Past x And x Future.,148,He never told me what it \Nwas that he wanted.
40676,Past x And x Future.,148,Catch me if you can.
40677,Past x And x Future.,148,"You are a Hunter, aren't you?"
40678,Past x And x Future.,148,Ging...
40679,Past x And x Future.,148,Past x And x Future
40680,Past x And x Future.,148,You want to climb the tree?
40681,Past x And x Future.,148,No one under the age of eighteen \Ncan go beyond this point.
40682,Past x And x Future.,148,Unless you have some special \Nlicense or certification...
40683,Past x And x Future.,148,A pro Hunter?
40684,Past x And x Future.,148,At your age?
40685,Past x And x Future.,148,"Excuse me, then."
40686,Past x And x Future.,148,Go right ahead.
40687,Past x And x Future.,148,But I'll need you to sign this first.
40688,Past x And x Future.,148,Even a president would have to sign it.
40689,Past x And x Future.,148,It's just the usual thing that says you \Ndon't care if you die during the climb.
40690,Past x And x Future.,148,Here's some advice!
40691,Past x And x Future.,148,Don't trust any of the grips or footholds \Nleft behind by previous climbers.
40692,Past x And x Future.,148,Those who make it to the top \Nusually do it bare-handed.
40693,Past x And x Future.,148,That's how the guy who's at \Nthe top right now did it.
40694,Past x And x Future.,148,Got it! Thanks!
40695,Past x And x Future.,148,"Well, if you feel you're in trouble, \Njust press that button."
40696,Past x And x Future.,148,Our rescue team is skilled.
40697,Past x And x Future.,148,If you can hold on to the tree for ten minutes—
40698,Past x And x Future.,148,He fell?!
40699,Past x And x Future.,148,Hey!
40700,Past x And x Future.,148,Hey!
40701,Past x And x Future.,148,He's already up there?
40702,Past x And x Future.,148,I still have a long way to go...
40703,Past x And x Future.,148,This tree is incredible.
40704,Past x And x Future.,148,I can entrust myself to it.
40705,Past x And x Future.,148,"The moment my fingers touch it,"
40706,Past x And x Future.,148,"I can feel that there's life there, and that it flows throughout the entire tree."
40707,Past x And x Future.,148,I can do this!
40708,Past x And x Future.,148,So long as I heed the tree's whispering as I climb...
40709,Past x And x Future.,148,Help...
40710,Past x And x Future.,148,Help me...
40711,Past x And x Future.,148,Almost there.
40712,Past x And x Future.,148,The top looks funny.
40713,Past x And x Future.,148,They're huge!
40714,Past x And x Future.,148,That scared me...
40715,Past x And x Future.,148,Hi!
40716,Past x And x Future.,148,Yo.
40717,Past x And x Future.,148,I was tired of waiting.
40718,Past x And x Future.,148,Ging...
40719,Past x And x Future.,148,How long did it take you to get \Nhere from the 500-meter point?
40720,Past x And x Future.,148,Uh...
40721,Past x And x Future.,148,Around twenty minutes?
40722,Past x And x Future.,148,"Well, I guess that's acceptable for your first time..."
40723,Past x And x Future.,148,Eat up.
40724,Past x And x Future.,148,Yep!
40725,Past x And x Future.,148,"Beautiful view, right?"
40726,Past x And x Future.,148,"On overcast days, it's like a sea of clouds."
40727,Past x And x Future.,148,Yeah!
40728,Past x And x Future.,148,"Hey, Ging..."
40729,Past x And x Future.,148,Hmm?
40730,Past x And x Future.,148,Can I ask you something?
40731,Past x And x Future.,148,"Sure. I might not give you an answer, though."
40732,Past x And x Future.,148,What is it that you want?
40733,Past x And x Future.,148,That which I can't see in front of me right now.
40734,Past x And x Future.,148,That which you can't see in front of you?
40735,Past x And x Future.,148,I wanted to become a Hunter because...
40736,Past x And x Future.,148,Shut up!
40737,Past x And x Future.,148,"I wanted to become a Hunter because, at the time, it was the most practical way to get into the place I wanted to go."
40738,Past x And x Future.,148,That place was used as a certain \Nroyal family's burial ground.
40739,Past x And x Future.,148,"To enter, you had to belong to \Na trustworthy organization, and to agree never to speak of it."
40740,Past x And x Future.,148,And you had to pay all expenses out of pocket.
40741,Past x And x Future.,148,"In other words, you couldn't really explore it at all."
40742,Past x And x Future.,148,You won't find anyone willing to spend the resources and receive nothing in return.
40743,Past x And x Future.,148,But I saw it as my chance.
40744,Past x And x Future.,148,"If I became a trusted pro Hunter, getting the money wouldn't be a problem."
40745,Past x And x Future.,148,"When I turned fifteen,"
40746,Past x And x Future.,148,I set up a special nonprofit organization to explore and repair the tomb.
40747,Past x And x Future.,148,"Before that, I'd spent the two \Nyears after getting my license surfing archaeology buffs' websites and blogs online."
40748,Past x And x Future.,148,"To create the nonprofit, I needed about ten oddballs who didn't need money or fame, \Nbut only wanted to know the truth, and who could be trusted to keep secrets."
40749,Past x And x Future.,148,I'm always going after what I need.
40750,Past x And x Future.,148,"I'm so focused, I stop caring about \Nthe ultimate goal that lies beyond."
40751,Past x And x Future.,148,Too hard to understand?
40752,Past x And x Future.,148,Then I guess I'll keep going.
40753,Past x And x Future.,148,The people I recruited online and \Nbefriended in offline meetings were all older than me.
40754,Past x And x Future.,148,"They were regular office workers, \Ngraduate students, and job-hoppers."
40755,Past x And x Future.,148,"After I told them my background and plan, they helped with the various tasks \Nto create the nonprofit, and they even gave donations \Nfrom what little money they had."
40756,Past x And x Future.,148,"When our dream was realized and \Nwe stepped inside for the first time, the best part for me wasn't when I finally witnessed the truth of the tomb."
40757,Past x And x Future.,148,It was when I looked at my colleagues' faces and shook their hands.
40758,Past x And x Future.,148,"To this day, they still work for the \Nnonprofit with zero compensation, providing me with viable information."
40759,Past x And x Future.,148,The secret of the tomb was nothing compared to the relationships I built.
40760,Past x And x Future.,148,What was truly important came \Nto me before what I wanted.
40761,Past x And x Future.,148,And now?
40762,Past x And x Future.,148,Huh?
40763,Past x And x Future.,148,What are you after now?
40764,Past x And x Future.,148,Right now?
40765,Past x And x Future.,148,It'll take some time to explain...
40766,Past x And x Future.,148,"Gon, what is this tree we just climbed?"
40767,Past x And x Future.,148,Huh? It's the World Tree.
40768,Past x And x Future.,148,That's right.
40769,Past x And x Future.,148,"Down below, how did they describe the tree?"
40770,Past x And x Future.,148,"At 1,784 meters, it's the world's tallest tree."
40771,Past x And x Future.,148,"Technically, that's right."
40772,Past x And x Future.,148,But the truth is that this tree is a young sapling that's stopped growing.
40773,Past x And x Future.,148,"A World Tree that didn't receive enough nutrition, \Nand could only grow this tall."
40774,Past x And x Future.,148,"A real World Tree would take in magma, embed its roots in the mountains, and continue to grow after leaving the atmosphere."
40775,Past x And x Future.,148,Outside this world.
40776,Past x And x Future.,148,This world?
40777,Past x And x Future.,148,The world map that you're familiar with.
40778,Past x And x Future.,148,The Ants that you and the chairman fought were a non-native species from outside this world.
40779,Past x And x Future.,148,That's the truth they don't teach you in school.
40780,Past x And x Future.,148,Adults with common sense choose not to go near Pandora's Box.
40781,Past x And x Future.,148,"In other words, the world that we know is nothing but a small part of a much bigger world."
40782,Past x And x Future.,148,"There are records showing that a chosen few, from a select time and place, \Nwere able to make it outside."
40783,Past x And x Future.,148,Understand now?
40784,Past x And x Future.,148,I still want the same thing I always have.
40785,Past x And x Future.,148,Something that I can't see in front of me.
40786,Past x And x Future.,148,There are many requirements to go outside.
40787,Past x And x Future.,148,At least four are required before \Nyou can even start the journey.
40788,Past x And x Future.,148,"Authorization, the means, qualification, a contract."
40789,Past x And x Future.,148,I still haven't obtained a single one.
40790,Past x And x Future.,148,But I'm in no rush.
40791,Past x And x Future.,148,I'm enjoying the journey.
40792,Past x And x Future.,148,So if our paths happen to cross in the future...
40793,Past x And x Future.,148,You should enjoy the little detours.
40794,Past x And x Future.,148,To the fullest.
40795,Past x And x Future.,148,Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.
40796,Past x And x Future.,148,Oh!
40797,Past x And x Future.,148,Ging...
40798,Past x And x Future.,148,Here.
40799,Past x And x Future.,148,Kite asked me to return this to you.
40800,Past x And x Future.,148,"Oh, okay."
40801,Past x And x Future.,148,The scar's still on my shoulder.
40802,Past x And x Future.,148,See? Right here.
40803,Past x And x Future.,148,"And then, there was a huge boom!"
40804,Past x And x Future.,148,"And what popped out was \Nanother coffin, just this big."
40805,Past x And x Future.,148,"They're called the Testing Gates, \Nand you have to open them to go inside."
40806,Past x And x Future.,148,Marshal
40807,Past x And x Future.,148,Spy
40808,Past x And x Future.,148,You should enjoy the little detours.
40809,Past x And x Future.,148,To the fullest.
40810,Past x And x Future.,148,Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want.
